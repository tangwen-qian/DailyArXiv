| **[Predicting Camera Pose from Perspective Descriptions for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06041v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-image spatial reasoning remains challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While single-view perception is inherently 2D, reasoning over multiple views requires building a coherent scene understanding across viewpoints. In particular, we study perspective taking, where a model must build a coherent 3D understanding from multi-view observations and use it to reason from a new, language-specified viewpoint. We introduce CAMCUE, a pose-aware multi-image framework that uses camera pose as an explicit geometric anchor for cross-view fusion and novel-view reasoning. CAMCUE injects per-view pose into visual tokens, grounds natural-language viewpoint descriptions to a target camera pose, and synthesizes a pose-conditioned imagined target view to support answering. To support this setting, we curate CAMCUE-DATA with 27,668 training and 508 test instances pairing multi-view images and poses with diverse target-viewpoint descriptions and perspective-shift questions. We also include human-annotated viewpoint descriptions in the test split to evaluate generalization to human language. CAMCUE improves overall accuracy by 9.06% and predicts target poses from natural-language viewpoint descriptions with over 90% rotation accuracy within 20° and translation accuracy within a 0.5 error threshold. This direct grounding avoids expensive test-time search-and-match, reducing inference time from 256.6s to 1.45s per example and enabling fast, interactive use in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thinking with Geometry: Active Geometry Integration for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06037v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in spatial reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly leverages geometric priors from 3D encoders. However, most existing integration strategies remain passive: geometry is exposed as a global stream and fused in an indiscriminate manner, which often induces semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals. We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench. Furthermore, GeoThinker demonstrates robust generalization and significantly improved spatial perception across complex downstream scenarios, including embodied referring and autonomous driving. Our results indicate that the ability to actively integrate spatial structures is essential for next-generation spatial intelligence.

| **[SPhyR: Spatial-Physical Reasoning Benchmark on Material Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16048v4)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel dataset designed to benchmark the physical and spatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) based on topology optimization, a method for computing optimal material distributions within a design space under prescribed loads and supports. In this dataset, LLMs are provided with conditions such as 2D boundary, applied forces and supports, and must reason about the resulting optimal material distribution. The dataset includes a variety of tasks, ranging from filling in masked regions within partial structures to predicting complete material distributions. Solving these tasks requires understanding the flow of forces and the required material distribution under given constraints, without access to simulation tools or explicit physical models, challenging models to reason about structural stability and spatial organization. Our dataset targets the evaluation of spatial and physical reasoning abilities in 2D settings, offering a complementary perspective to traditional language and logic benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[STProtein: predicting spatial protein expression from multi-omics data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05811v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of spatial multi-omics data from single tissues is crucial for advancing biological research. However, a significant data imbalance impedes progress: while spatial transcriptomics data is relatively abundant, spatial proteomics data remains scarce due to technical limitations and high costs. To overcome this challenge we propose STProtein, a novel framework leveraging graph neural networks with multi-task learning strategy. STProtein is designed to accurately predict unknown spatial protein expression using more accessible spatial multi-omics data, such as spatial transcriptomics. We believe that STProtein can effectively addresses the scarcity of spatial proteomics, accelerating the integration of spatial multi-omics and potentially catalyzing transformative breakthroughs in life sciences. This tool enables scientists to accelerate discovery by identifying complex and previously hidden spatial patterns of proteins within tissues, uncovering novel relationships between different marker genes, and exploring the biological "Dark Matter".</p></details> | <details><summary>STPro...</summary><p>STProtein: predicting spatial protein expression from multi-omics data is accepted SPARTA_AAAI2026 Oral GitHub: https://github.com/zhaorui-bi/STProtein</p></details> |
| **[Copula-based models for spatially dependent cylindrical data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05778v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cylindrical data frequently arise across various scientific disciplines, including meteorology (e.g., wind direction and speed), oceanography (e.g., marine current direction and speed or wave heights), ecology (e.g., telemetry), and medicine (e.g., seasonality and intensity in disease onset). Such data often occur as spatially correlated series of intensities and angles, thereby representing dependent bivariate response vectors of linear and circular components. To accommodate both the circular-linear dependence and spatial autocorrelation, while remaining flexible in marginal specifications, copula-based models for cylindrical data have been developed in the literature. However, existing approaches typically treat the copula parameters as constants unrelated to covariates, and regression specifications for marginal distributions are frequently restricted to linear predictors, thereby ignoring spatial correlation. In this work, we propose a structured additive conditional copula regression model for cylindrical data. The circular component is modeled using a wrapped Gaussian process, and the linear component follows a distributional regression model. Both components allow for the inclusion of linear covariate effects. Furthermore, by leveraging the empirical equivalence between Gaussian random fields (GRFs) and Gaussian Markov random fields, our approach avoids the computational burden typically associated with GRFs, while simultaneously allowing for non-stationarity in the covariance structure. Posterior estimation is performed via Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. We evaluate the proposed model in a simulation study and subsequently in an analysis of wind directions and speed in Germany.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSG: Scaled Spatial Guidance for Multi-Scale Visual Autoregressive Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05534v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual autoregressive (VAR) models generate images through next-scale prediction, naturally achieving coarse-to-fine, fast, high-fidelity synthesis mirroring human perception. In practice, this hierarchy can drift at inference time, as limited capacity and accumulated error cause the model to deviate from its coarse-to-fine nature. We revisit this limitation from an information-theoretic perspective and deduce that ensuring each scale contributes high-frequency content not explained by earlier scales mitigates the train-inference discrepancy. With this insight, we propose Scaled Spatial Guidance (SSG), training-free, inference-time guidance that steers generation toward the intended hierarchy while maintaining global coherence. SSG emphasizes target high-frequency signals, defined as the semantic residual, isolated from a coarser prior. To obtain this prior, we leverage a principled frequency-domain procedure, Discrete Spatial Enhancement (DSE), which is devised to sharpen and better isolate the semantic residual through frequency-aware construction. SSG applies broadly across VAR models leveraging discrete visual tokens, regardless of tokenization design or conditioning modality. Experiments demonstrate SSG yields consistent gains in fidelity and diversity while preserving low latency, revealing untapped efficiency in coarse-to-fine image generation. Code is available at https://github.com/Youngwoo-git/SSG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Rule-Based Spatial Mixture-of-Experts U-Net for Explainable Edge Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05100v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models like U-Net and its variants, have established state-of-the-art performance in edge detection tasks and are used by Generative AI services world-wide for their image generation models. However, their decision-making processes remain opaque, operating as "black boxes" that obscure the rationale behind specific boundary predictions. This lack of transparency is a critical barrier in safety-critical applications where verification is mandatory. To bridge the gap between high-performance deep learning and interpretable logic, we propose the Rule-Based Spatial Mixture-of-Experts U-Net (sMoE U-Net). Our architecture introduces two key innovations: (1) Spatially-Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts (sMoE) blocks integrated into the decoder skip connections, which dynamically gate between "Context" (smooth) and "Boundary" (sharp) experts based on local feature statistics; and (2) a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) Fuzzy Head that replaces the standard classification layer. This fuzzy head fuses deep semantic features with heuristic edge signals using explicit IF-THEN rules. We evaluate our method on the BSDS500 benchmark, achieving an Optimal Dataset Scale (ODS) F-score of 0.7628, effectively matching purely deep baselines like HED (0.7688) while outperforming the standard U-Net (0.7437). Crucially, our model provides pixel-level explainability through "Rule Firing Maps" and "Strategy Maps," allowing users to visualize whether an edge was detected due to strong gradients, high semantic confidence, or specific logical rule combinations.</p></details> |  |
| **[The $α$--regression for compositional data: a unified framework for standard, spatially-lagged, spatial autoregressive and geographically-weighted regression models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12663v4)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional data--vectors of non-negative components summing to unity--frequently arise in scientific applications where covariates influence the relative proportions of components, yet traditional regression approaches ace challenges regarding the unit-sum constraint and zero values. This paper revisits the $α$--regression framework, which uses a flexible power transformation parameterized by $α$ to interpolate between raw data analysis and log-ratio methods, naturally handling zeros without imputation while allowing data-driven transformation selection. We formulate $α$--regression as a non-linear least squares problem, study its asymptotic properties, provide efficient estimation via the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, and derive marginal effects for interpretation. The framework is extended to spatial settings through three models: the $α$--spatially lagged X regression model, which incorporates spatial spillover effects via spatially lagged covariates with decomposition into direct and indirect effects, the $α$--spatially autoregressive regression model and the geographically weighted $α$--regression, which allows coefficients to vary spatially for capturing local relationships. Applications to two real data sets illustrate the performance of the models and showcase that spatial extensions capture the spatial dependence and improve the predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolutionary Mapping of Neural Networks to Spatial Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04717v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial accelerators, composed of arrays of compute-memory integrated units, offer an attractive platform for deploying inference workloads with low latency and low energy consumption. However, fully exploiting their architectural advantages typically requires careful, expert-driven mapping of computational graphs to distributed processing elements. In this work, we automate this process by framing the mapping challenge as a black-box optimization problem. We introduce the first evolutionary, hardware-in-the-loop mapping framework for neuromorphic accelerators, enabling users without deep hardware knowledge to deploy workloads more efficiently. We evaluate our approach on Intel Loihi 2, a representative spatial accelerator featuring 152 cores per chip in a 2D mesh. Our method achieves up to 35% reduction in total latency compared to default heuristics on two sparse multi-layer perceptron networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach to multi-chip systems and observe an up to 40% improvement in energy efficiency, without explicitly optimizing for it.</p></details> |  |
| **[EgoActor: Grounding Task Planning into Spatial-aware Egocentric Actions for Humanoid Robots via Visual-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04515v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying humanoid robots in real-world settings is fundamentally challenging, as it demands tight integration of perception, locomotion, and manipulation under partial-information observations and dynamically changing environments. As well as transitioning robustly between sub-tasks of different types. Towards addressing these challenges, we propose a novel task - EgoActing, which requires directly grounding high-level instructions into various, precise, spatially aware humanoid actions. We further instantiate this task by introducing EgoActor, a unified and scalable vision-language model (VLM) that can predict locomotion primitives (e.g., walk, turn, move sideways, change height), head movements, manipulation commands, and human-robot interactions to coordinate perception and execution in real-time. We leverage broad supervision over egocentric RGB-only data from real-world demonstrations, spatial reasoning question-answering, and simulated environment demonstrations, enabling EgoActor to make robust, context-aware decisions and perform fluent action inference (under 1s) with both 8B and 4B parameter models. Extensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that EgoActor effectively bridges abstract task planning and concrete motor execution, while generalizing across diverse tasks and unseen environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think3D: Thinking with Space for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13029v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and reasoning about the physical world requires spatial intelligence: the ability to interpret geometry, perspective, and spatial relations beyond 2D perception. While recent vision large models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding, they remain fundamentally 2D perceivers and struggle with genuine 3D reasoning. We introduce Think3D, a framework that enables VLM agents to think with 3D space. By leveraging 3D reconstruction models that recover point clouds and camera poses from images or videos, Think3D allows the agent to actively manipulate space through camera-based operations and ego/global-view switching, transforming spatial reasoning into an interactive 3D chain-of-thought process. Without additional training, Think3D significantly improves the spatial reasoning performance of advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro, yielding average gains of +7.8% on BLINK Multi-view and MindCube, and +4.7% on VSI-Bench. We further show that smaller models, which struggle with spatial exploration, benefit significantly from a reinforcement learning policy that enables the model to select informative viewpoints and operations. With RL, the benefit from tool usage increases from +0.7% to +6.8%. Our findings demonstrate that training-free, tool-augmented spatial exploration is a viable path toward more flexible and human-like 3D reasoning in multimodal agents, establishing a new dimension of multimodal intelligence. Code and weights are released at https://github.com/zhangzaibin/spagent.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRAM: Spatial general-purpose audio representation models for real-world applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00934v5)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio foundation models learn general-purpose audio representations that facilitate a wide range of downstream tasks. While the performance of these models has greatly increased for conventional single-channel, dry audio clips, their success in real-world acoustic environments with reverberation and noise is limited. Furthermore, most audio foundation models ignore the spatial dimension of real-world acoustic environments, ruling out tasks involving sound localization. To address these limitations, we propose GRAM: a general-purpose real-world audio model that employs a multi-channel masked autoencoder to efficiently learn spatial audio representations. We evaluated GRAM and other audio foundation models in a standardized manner on high-quality simulations of naturalistic, spatial acoustic environments as well as recordings of real-world environments and release these two complementary benchmark task suites: NatHEAR and RealSELD. Our results demonstrate that GRAM outperforms all state-of-the-art self-supervised audio foundation models on NatHEAR and the clean, single-channel version HEAR, while using only a fraction of the training data. GRAM also shows state-of-the-art localization performance in simulated environments and generalizes efficiently to real-world recordings in RealSELD. Taken together, GRAM presents a significant advance toward robust spatial audio foundation models for real-world environments.</p></details> | Revise with RealSELD |

| **[Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion Mamba for Multi-Modal Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04405v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to combine images from different modalities to produce fused images, retaining texture details and preserving significant information. Recently, some MMIF methods incorporate frequency domain information to enhance spatial features. However, these methods typically rely on simple serial or parallel spatial-frequency fusion without interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion Mamba (ISFM) framework for MMIF. Specifically, we begin with a Modality-Specific Extractor (MSE) to extract features from different modalities. It models long-range dependencies across the image with linear computational complexity. To effectively leverage frequency information, we then propose a Multi-scale Frequency Fusion (MFF). It adaptively integrates low-frequency and high-frequency components across multiple scales, enabling robust representations of frequency features. More importantly, we further propose an Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion (ISF). It incorporates frequency features to guide spatial features across modalities, enhancing complementary representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on six MMIF datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our ISFM can achieve better performances than other state-of-the-art methods.

Evidence from Spatial n-Back in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04355v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Working memory is a central component of intelligent behavior, providing a dynamic workspace for maintaining and updating task-relevant information. Recent work has used n-back tasks to probe working-memory-like behavior in large language models, but it is unclear whether the same probe elicits comparable computations when information is carried in a visual rather than textual code in vision-language models. We evaluate Qwen2.5 and Qwen2.5-VL on a controlled spatial n-back task presented as matched text-rendered or image-rendered grids. Across conditions, models show reliably higher accuracy and d' with text than with vision. To interpret these differences at the process level, we use trial-wise log-probability evidence and find that nominal 2/3-back often fails to reflect the instructed lag and instead aligns with a recency-locked comparison. We further show that grid size alters recent-repeat structure in the stimulus stream, thereby changing interference and error patterns. These results motivate computation-sensitive interpretations of multimodal working memory.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAVGBench: Benchmarking Spatially Aligned Audio-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13462v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the lack of multimodal generative models capable of producing high-quality videos with spatially aligned audio. While recent advancements in generative models have been successful in video generation, they often overlook the spatial alignment between audio and visuals, which is essential for immersive experiences. To tackle this problem, we establish a new research direction in benchmarking the Spatially Aligned Audio-Video Generation (SAVG) task. We introduce a spatially aligned audio-visual dataset, whose audio and video data are curated based on whether sound events are onscreen or not. We also propose a new alignment metric that aims to evaluate the spatial alignment between audio and video. Then, using the dataset and metric, we benchmark two types of baseline methods: one is based on a joint audio-video generation model, and the other is a two-stage method that combines a video generation model and a video-to-audio generation model. Our experimental results demonstrate that gaps exist between the baseline methods and the ground truth in terms of video and audio quality, as well as spatial alignment between the two modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[VTok: A Unified Video Tokenizer with Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Latents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04202v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents VTok, a unified video tokenization framework that can be used for both generation and understanding tasks. Unlike the leading vision-language systems that tokenize videos through a naive frame-sampling strategy, we propose to decouple the spatial and temporal representations of videos by retaining the spatial features of a single key frame while encoding each subsequent frame into a single residual token, achieving compact yet expressive video tokenization. Our experiments suggest that VTok effectively reduces the complexity of video representation from the product of frame count and per-frame token count to their sum, while the residual tokens sufficiently capture viewpoint and motion changes relative to the key frame. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of VTok: it achieves notably higher performance on a range of video understanding and text-to-video generation benchmarks compared with baselines using naive tokenization, all with shorter token sequences per video (e.g., 3.4% higher accuracy on our TV-Align benchmark and 1.9% higher VBench score). Remarkably, VTok produces more coherent motion and stronger guidance following in text-to-video generation, owing to its more consistent temporal encoding. We hope VTok can serve as a standardized video tokenization paradigm for future research in video understanding and generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[The World is Not Mono: Enabling Spatial Understanding in Large Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02954v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing large audio-language models perceive the world as "mono"-a single stream of audio that ignores the critical spatial dimension ("where") required for universal audio scene analysis (ASA). To bridge this gap, we first introduce a hierarchical framework for audio scene analysis. Guided by this framework, we introduce a system that enables large audio-language models (LALMs) to understand and reason about the complex acoustic world. Our system endows LALMs with universal spatial understanding through four key innovations: (1) A scalable simulation pipeline that synthesizes high-quality First-Order-Ambisonics(FOA) data; (2) A unified model framework that integrates universal spatial encoding with a dense hybrid projection mechanism to bridge the modality gap; (3) A progressive training curriculum that evolves from representation alignment to reinforcement learning-based reasoning; and (4) A comprehensive benchmark for audio scene analysis (ASA) designed to rigorously evaluate atomic perception, relational integration, and cognitive reasoning capabilities, on which our model demonstrates comparatively strong capability for spatial understanding. Our work provides a clear pathway for leveraging the powerful reasoning abilities of LALMs towards holistic ASA, advancing from "mono" semantic recognition to spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[HoloEv-Net: Efficient Event-based Action Recognition via Holographic Spatial Embedding and Global Spectral Gating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04182v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based Action Recognition (EAR) has attracted significant attention due to the high temporal resolution and high dynamic range of event cameras. However, existing methods typically suffer from (i) the computational redundancy of dense voxel representations, (ii) structural redundancy inherent in multi-branch architectures, and (iii) the under-utilization of spectral information in capturing global motion patterns. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient EAR framework named HoloEv-Net. First, to simultaneously tackle representation and structural redundancies, we introduce a Compact Holographic Spatiotemporal Representation (CHSR). Departing from computationally expensive voxel grids, CHSR implicitly embeds horizontal spatial cues into the Time-Height (T-H) view, effectively preserving 3D spatiotemporal contexts within a 2D representation. Second, to exploit the neglected spectral cues, we design a Global Spectral Gating (GSG) module. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for global token mixing in the frequency domain, GSG enhances the representation capability with negligible parameter overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our framework. Specifically, HoloEv-Net-Base achieves state-of-the-art performance on THU-EACT-50-CHL, HARDVS and DailyDVS-200, outperforming existing methods by 10.29%, 1.71% and 6.25%, respectively. Furthermore, our lightweight variant, HoloEv-Net-Small, delivers highly competitive accuracy while offering extreme efficiency, reducing parameters by 5.4 times, FLOPs by 300times, and latency by 2.4times compared to heavy baselines, demonstrating its potential for edge deployment.</p></details> |  |

Existing deep learning methods either fail to capture long-range spectral dependencies (e.g., convolutional neural networks) or suffer from high computational cost (e.g., Transformers). To address these challenges, we propose DMS2F-HAD, a novel dual-branch Mamba-based model. Our architecture utilizes Mamba's linear-time modeling to efficiently learn distinct spatial and spectral features in specialized branches, which are then integrated by a dynamic gated fusion mechanism to enhance anomaly localization. Across fourteen benchmark HSI datasets, our proposed DMS2F-HAD not only achieves a state-of-the-art average AUC of 98.78%, but also demonstrates superior efficiency with an inference speed 4.6 times faster than comparable deep learning methods. The results highlight DMS2FHAD's strong generalization and scalability, positioning it as a strong candidate for practical HAD applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted in the WACV 2025 conference in algorithm track</p></details> |
| **[SpatiaLab: Can Vision-Language Models Perform Spatial Reasoning in the Wild?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03916v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, yet it remains a major challenge for contemporary vision-language models (VLMs). Prior work largely relied on synthetic or LLM-generated environments with limited task designs and puzzle-like setups, failing to capture the real-world complexity, visual noise, and diverse spatial relationships that VLMs encounter. To address this, we introduce SpatiaLab, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning in realistic, unconstrained contexts. SpatiaLab comprises 1,400 visual question-answer pairs across six major categories: Relative Positioning, Depth & Occlusion, Orientation, Size & Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry, each with five subcategories, yielding 30 distinct task types. Each subcategory contains at least 25 questions, and each main category includes at least 200 questions, supporting both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation. Experiments across diverse state-of-the-art VLMs, including open- and closed-source models, reasoning-focused, and specialized spatial reasoning models, reveal a substantial gap in spatial reasoning capabilities compared with humans. In the multiple-choice setup, InternVL3.5-72B achieves 54.93% accuracy versus 87.57% for humans. In the open-ended setting, all models show a performance drop of around 10-25%, with GPT-5-mini scoring highest at 40.93% versus 64.93% for humans. These results highlight key limitations in handling complex spatial relationships, depth perception, navigation, and 3D geometry. By providing a diverse, real-world evaluation framework, SpatiaLab exposes critical challenges and opportunities for advancing VLMs' spatial reasoning, offering a benchmark to guide future research toward robust, human-aligned spatial understanding.

Current methods lack versatility in delivering accurate, robust, and real-time compatible lane detection, especially vision-based methods often neglect critical regions of the image and their spatial-temporal (ST) salience, leading to poor performance in difficult circumstances such as serious occlusion and dazzle lighting. This study introduces a novel sequential neural network model with a spatial-temporal attention mechanism to focus on key features of lane lines and exploit salient ST correlations among continuous image frames. The proposed model, built on a standard encoder-decoder structure and common neural network backbones, is trained and evaluated on three large-scale open-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strength and robustness of the proposed model, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in various testing scenarios. Furthermore, with the ST attention mechanism, the developed sequential neural network models exhibit fewer parameters and reduced Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) compared to baseline sequential models, highlighting their computational efficiency.

Existing computational models typically require long sequential trajectories to build accurate maps, but neuroscience evidence suggests maps can also arise from integrating disjoint experiences governed by consistent spatial rules. We introduce the Episodic Spatial World Model (ESWM), a novel framework that constructs spatial maps from sparse, disjoint episodic memories. Across environments of varying complexity, ESWM predicts unobserved transitions from minimal experience, and the geometry of its latent space aligns with that of the environment. Because it operates on episodic memories that can be independently stored and updated, ESWM is inherently adaptive, enabling rapid adjustment to environmental changes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ESWM readily enables near-optimal strategies for exploring novel environments and navigating between arbitrary points, all without the need for additional training. Our work demonstrates how neuroscience-inspired principles of episodic memory can advance the development of more flexible and generalizable world models.</p></details> | Accepted ICLR 2026 |
| **[Investigating the Influence of Spatial Ability in Augmented Reality-assisted Robot Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03544v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmented Reality (AR) offers promising opportunities to enhance learning, but its mechanisms and effects are not yet fully understood. As learning becomes increasingly personalized, considering individual learner characteristics becomes more important. This study investigates the moderating effect of spatial ability on learning experience with AR in the context of robot programming. A between-subjects experiment ($N=71$) compared conventional robot programming to an AR-assisted approach using a head-mounted display. Participants' spatial ability was assessed using the Mental Rotation Test. The learning experience was measured through the System Usability Scale (SUS) and cognitive load. The results indicate that AR support does not significantly improve the learning experience compared to the conventional approach. However, AR appears to have a compensatory effect on the influence of spatial ability. In the control group, spatial ability was significantly positively associated with SUS scores and negatively associated with extraneous cognitive load, indicating that higher spatial ability predicts a better learning experience. In the AR condition, these relationships were not observable, suggesting that AR mitigated the disadvantage typically experienced by learners with lower spatial abilities. These findings suggest that AR can serve a compensatory function by reducing the influence of learner characteristics. Future research should further explore this compensatory role of AR to guide the design of personalized learning environments that address diverse learner needs and reduce barriers for learners with varying cognitive profiles.</p></details> |  |

Current vibrotactile approaches often face challenges with the spatial and temporal resolution needed to render different 3D geometries. Inspired by the natural deformation of finger pads when exploring 3D objects and surfaces, we propose TactDeform, a parametric approach to render spatio-temporal tactile patterns using a finger-worn electro-tactile interface. The system dynamically renders electro-tactile patterns based on both interaction contexts (approaching, contact, and sliding) and geometric contexts (geometric features and textures), emulating deformations that occur during real-world touch exploration. Results from a user study \rr{(N=24)} show that the proposed approach enabled high texture discrimination and geometric feature identification compared to a baseline. Informed by results from a free 3D-geometry exploration phase, we provide insights that can inform future tactile interface designs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CHI 2026.

| **[Beyond the Vision Encoder: Identifying and Mitigating Spatial Bias in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21984v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the spatial bias of LVLMs, examining how models respond when identical key visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through controlled probing experiments, we observe that current LVLMs often produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a clear spatial bias in their semantic understanding. Further analysis indicates that this bias does not stem from the vision encoder, but rather from a mismatch in attention mechanisms between the vision encoder and the large language model, which disrupts the global information flow. Motivated by this insight, we propose Adaptive Global Context Injection (AGCI), a lightweight mechanism that dynamically injects shared global visual context into each image token. AGCI works without architectural modifications, mitigating spatial bias by enhancing the semantic accessibility of image tokens while preserving the model's intrinsic capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGCI not only enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs, but also achieves strong performance on various downstream tasks and hallucination benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior systems that rely on additional cues (e.g., gesture, gaze) or manual expert annotations, Speech-to-Spatial infers the intended target solely from spoken references (speech input). Motivated by our formative study of speech referencing patterns, we characterize recurring ways people specify targets (Direct Attribute, Relational, Remembrance, and Chained) and ground them to our object-centric relational graph. Given an utterance, referent cues are parsed and rendered as persistent in-situ AR visual guidance, reducing iterative micro-guidance ("a bit more to the right", "now, stop.") during remote guidance. We demonstrate the use cases of our system with remote guided assistance and intent disambiguation scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Speechto-Spatial improves task efficiency, reduces cognitive load, and enhances usability compared to a conventional voice-only baseline, transforming disembodied verbal instruction into visually explainable, actionable guidance on a live shared view.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Causal Graph Spatial-Temporal Autoencoder for Reliable and Interpretable Process Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03004v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To improve the reliability and interpretability of industrial process monitoring, this article proposes a Causal Graph Spatial-Temporal Autoencoder (CGSTAE). The network architecture of CGSTAE combines two components: a correlation graph structure learning module based on spatial self-attention mechanism (SSAM) and a spatial-temporal encoder-decoder module utilizing graph convolutional long-short term memory (GCLSTM). The SSAM learns correlation graphs by capturing dynamic relationships between variables, while a novel three-step causal graph structure learning algorithm is introduced to derive a causal graph from these correlation graphs. The algorithm leverages a reverse perspective of causal invariance principle to uncover the invariant causal graph from varying correlations. The spatial-temporal encoder-decoder, built with GCLSTM units, reconstructs time-series process data within a sequence-to-sequence framework. The proposed CGSTAE enables effective process monitoring and fault detection through two statistics in the feature space and residual space. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of CGSTAE in process monitoring through the Tennessee Eastman process and a real-world air separation process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nüwa: Mending the Spatial Integrity Torn by VLM Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02951v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision token pruning has proven to be an effective acceleration technique for the efficient Vision Language Model (VLM). However, existing pruning methods demonstrate excellent performance preservation in visual question answering (VQA) and suffer substantial degradation on visual grounding (VG) tasks. Our analysis of the VLM's processing pipeline reveals that strategies utilizing global semantic similarity and attention scores lose the global spatial reference frame, which is derived from the interactions of tokens' positional information. Motivated by these findings, we propose $\text{Nüwa}$, a two-stage token pruning framework that enables efficient feature aggregation while maintaining spatial integrity. In the first stage, after the vision encoder, we apply three operations, namely separation, alignment, and aggregation, which are inspired by swarm intelligence algorithms to retain information-rich global spatial anchors. In the second stage, within the LLM, we perform text-guided pruning to retain task-relevant visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\text{Nüwa}$ achieves SOTA performance on multiple VQA benchmarks (from 94% to 95%) and yields substantial improvements on visual grounding tasks (from 7% to 47%).</p></details> |  |

We unify major approaches through a single quadratic form and derive general consistency conditions. We reveal that several widely used methods, including Moran's I, are inconsistent, and propose scalable corrections. The resulting test enables robust pattern detection across millions of spatial locations and single-cell lineage-tracing datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling spatial interference and spatial confounding biases in causal inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02777v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial interference and spatial confounding are two major issues inhibiting precise causal estimates when dealing with observational spatial data. Moreover, the definition and interpretation of spatial confounding remain arguable in the literature. In this paper, our goal is to provide clarity in a novel way on misconception and issues around spatial confounding from Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) perspective and to disentangle both direct, indirect spatial confounding and spatial interference based on bias induced on causal estimates. Also, existing analyses of spatial confounding bias typically rely on Normality assumptions for treatments and confounders, assumptions that are often violated in practice. Relaxing these assumptions, we derive analytical expressions for spatial confounding bias under more general distributional settings using Poisson as example . We showed that the choice of spatial weights, the distribution of the treatment, and the magnitude of interference critically determine the extent of bias due to spatial interference. We further demonstrate that direct and indirect spatial confounding can be disentangled, with both the weight matrix and the nature of exposure playing central roles in determining the magnitude of indirect bias. Theoretical results are supported by simulation studies and an application to real-world spatial data. In future, parametric frameworks for concomitantly adjusting for spatial interference, direct and indirect spatial confounding for both direct and mediated effects estimation will be developed.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we analyze data from the Xenium platform, which captures high-resolution images of tumor microarray (TMA) tissues and converts them into cell-by-gene matrices suitable for computational analysis. We benchmark and extend nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for spatial transcriptomics by introducing two spatially regularized variants. First, we propose Spatial NMF (SNMF), a lightweight baseline that enforces local spatial smoothness by diffusing each cell's NMF factor vector over its spatial neighborhood. Second, we introduce Hybrid Spatial NMF (hSNMF), which performs spatially regularized NMF followed by Leiden clustering on a hybrid adjacency that integrates spatial proximity (via a contact-radius graph) and transcriptomic similarity through a tunable mixing parameter alpha. Evaluated on a cholangiocarcinoma dataset, SNMF and hSNMF achieve markedly improved spatial compactness (CHAOS < 0.004, Moran's I > 0.96), greater cluster separability (Silhouette > 0.12, DBI < 1.8), and higher biological coherence (CMC and enrichment) compared to other spatial baselines.

This fragmentation fails to leverage biological principles shared across cancer types and hinders application to data-scarce scenarios. While pan-cancer training offers a solution, the resulting heterogeneity challenges monolithic architectures. To bridge this gap, we introduce MoLF (Mixture-of-Latent-Flow), a generative model for pan-cancer histogenomic prediction. MoLF leverages a conditional Flow Matching objective to map noise to the gene latent manifold, parameterized by a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) velocity field. By dynamically routing inputs to specialized sub-networks, this architecture effectively decouples the optimization of diverse tissue patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that MoLF establishes a new state-of-the-art, consistently outperforming both specialized and foundation model baselines on pan-cancer benchmarks. Furthermore, MoLF exhibits zero-shot generalization to cross-species data, suggesting it captures fundamental, conserved histo-molecular mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[A spatial random forest algorithm for population-level epidemiological risk assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02277v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial epidemiology identifies the drivers of elevated population-level disease risks, using disease counts, exposures and known confounders at the areal unit level. Poisson regression models are typically used for inference, which incorporate a linear/additive regression component and allow for unmeasured confounding via a set of spatially autocorrelated random effects. This approach requires the confounder interactions and their functional relationships with disease risk to be specified in advance, rather than being learned from the data. Therefore, this paper proposes the SPAR-Forest-ERF algorithm, which is the first fusion of random forests for capturing non-linear and interacting confounder-response effects with Bayesian spatial autocorrelation models that can estimate interpretable exposure response functions (ERF) with full uncertainty quantification. Methodologically, we extend existing methods set in a prediction context by propagating uncertainty between both the ML and statistical models, developing a new stopping criteria designed to ensure the stability of the primary inferential target, and incorporating a range of different ERFs for maximum model flexibility. This methodology is motivated by a new study quantifying the impact of air pollution concentrations on self-rated health in Scotland, using data from the recently released 2022 national census.</p></details> |  |

Oftentimes, deep learning is utilized to perform image demosaicing. Given that most modern digital imaging applications occur on mobile platforms, applying deep learning to demosaicing requires lightweight and efficient networks. Isotropic networks, also known as residual-in-residual networks, have been often employed for image demosaicing and joint-demosaicing-and-denoising (JDD). Most demosaicing isotropic networks avoid spatial downsampling entirely, and thus are often prohibitively expensive computationally for mobile applications. Contrary to previous isotropic network designs, this paper claims that spatial downsampling to a signficant degree can improve the efficiency and performance of isotropic networks. To validate this claim, we design simple fully convolutional networks with and without downsampling using a mathematical architecture design technique adapted from DeepMAD, and find that downsampling improves empirical performance. Additionally, empirical testing of the downsampled variant, JD3Net, of our fully convolutional networks reveals strong empirical performance on a variety of image demosaicing and JDD tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published at WVAQ Workshop at WACV.

High-level semantic SSL (e.g., DINO) relies on global tokens that are forced to be location-invariant for augmentation alignment, a process that inherently discards the spatial coordinates required for reconstruction. Conversely, generative SSL (e.g., MAE) preserves dense feature grids for reconstruction but fails to produce high-level abstractions. We introduce STELLAR, a framework that resolves this tension by factorizing visual features into a low-rank product of semantic concepts and their spatial distributions. This disentanglement allows us to perform DINO-style augmentation alignment on the semantic tokens while maintaining the precise spatial mapping in the localization matrix necessary for pixel-level reconstruction. We demonstrate that as few as 16 sparse tokens under this factorized form are sufficient to simultaneously support high-quality reconstruction (2.60 FID) and match the semantic performance of dense backbones (79.10% ImageNet accuracy). Our results highlight STELLAR as a versatile sparse representation that bridges the gap between discriminative and generative vision by strategically separating semantic identity from spatial geometry.

While many multi-modal benchmarks assess reasoning on visible visual information, the ability to infer unseen relationships through spatial visualization remains insufficiently evaluated as a spatial skill. This reliance on publicly sourced problems from IQ tests or math competitions risks data contamination and compromises assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 programmatically generated problems, a scalable framework that allows for expansion to ensure fair and continuously reliable evaluations. Our evaluation of 27 Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) reveals wide performance variations, demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, and uncovers counter-intuitive findings: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting paradoxically degrades accuracy on open-source models. Through statistical and qualitative analysis of error types, SpatialViz-Bench demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant lacuna in the field. The benchmark data and evaluation code are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Perception to Action: Spatial AI Agents and World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01644v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models have become the prevailing approach for agentic reasoning and planning, their success in symbolic domains does not readily translate to the physical world. Spatial intelligence, the ability to perceive 3D structure, reason about object relationships, and act under physical constraints, is an orthogonal capability that proves important for embodied agents. Existing surveys address either agentic architectures or spatial domains in isolation. None provide a unified framework connecting these complementary capabilities. This paper bridges that gap. Through a thorough review of over 2,000 papers, citing 742 works from top-tier venues, we introduce a unified three-axis taxonomy connecting agentic capabilities with spatial tasks across scales. Crucially, we distinguish spatial grounding (metric understanding of geometry and physics) from symbolic grounding (associating images with text), arguing that perception alone does not confer agency. Our analysis reveals three key findings mapped to these axes: (1) hierarchical memory systems (Capability axis) are important for long-horizon spatial tasks. (2) GNN-LLM integration (Task axis) is a promising approach for structured spatial reasoning. (3) World models (Scale axis) are essential for safe deployment across micro-to-macro spatial scales. We conclude by identifying six grand challenges and outlining directions for future research, including the need for unified evaluation frameworks to standardize cross-domain assessment. This taxonomy provides a foundation for unifying fragmented research efforts and enabling the next generation of spatially-aware autonomous systems in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and geospatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>61 pa...</summary><p>61 pages, 742 citations, 1 figure, 3 tables.

However, we can't manage what we can't measure. Accurately quantifying the pools and fluxes in the carbon, nutrient, and water nexus of the agroecosystem is therefore essential for understanding the underlying drivers of GHG and developing effective mitigation strategies. Conventional approaches like soil sampling, process-based models, and black-box machine learning models are facing challenges such as data sparsity, high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and complex subsurface biogeochemical and physical processes. Developing new trustworthy approaches such as AI-empowered models, will require the AI-ready benchmark dataset and outlined protocols, which unfortunately do not exist. In this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind spatial-temporal agroecosystem GHG benchmark dataset that integrates physics-based model simulations from Ecosys and DayCent with real-world observations from eddy covariance flux towers and controlled-environment facilities. We evaluate the performance of various sequential deep learning models on carbon and nitrogen flux prediction, including LSTM-based models, temporal CNN-based model, and Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we explored transfer learning to leverage simulated data to improve the generalization of deep learning models on real-world observations. Our benchmark dataset and evaluation framework contribute to the development of more accurate and scalable AI-driven agroecosystem models, advancing our understanding of ecosystem-climate interactions.</p></details> |  |

Conventional next-token prediction methods define the process as learning the conditional probability distribution of successive tokens. Recently, next-scale prediction methods redefine the process to learn the distribution over multi-scale representations, significantly reducing generation latency. However, these methods condition each scale on all previous scales and require each token to consider all preceding tokens, exhibiting scale and spatial redundancy. To better model the distribution by mitigating redundancy, we propose Markovian Visual AutoRegressive modeling (MVAR), a novel autoregressive framework that introduces scale and spatial Markov assumptions to reduce the complexity of conditional probability modeling. Specifically, we introduce a scale-Markov trajectory that only takes as input the features of adjacent preceding scale for next-scale prediction, enabling the adoption of a parallel training strategy that significantly reduces GPU memory consumption. Furthermore, we propose spatial-Markov attention, which restricts the attention of each token to a localized neighborhood of size k at corresponding positions on adjacent scales, rather than attending to every token across these scales, for the pursuit of reduced modeling complexity. Building on these improvements, we reduce the computational complexity of attention calculation from O(N^2) to O(Nk), enabling training with just eight NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs and eliminating the need for KV cache during inference. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that MVAR achieves comparable or superior performance with both small model trained from scratch and large fine-tuned models, while reducing the average GPU memory footprint by 3.0x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026.

| **[Harnessing Flexible Spatial and Temporal Data Center Workloads for Grid Regulation Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01508v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data centers (DCs) are increasingly recognized as flexible loads that can support grid frequency regulation. Yet, most existing methods treat workload scheduling and regulation capacity bidding separately, overlooking how queueing dynamics and spatial-temporal dispatch decisions affect the ability to sustain real-time regulation. As a result, the committed regulation may become infeasible or short-lived. To address this issue, we propose a unified day-ahead co-optimization framework that jointly decides workload distribution across geographically distributed DCs and regulation capacity commitments. We construct a space-time network model to capture workload migration costs, latency requirements, and heterogeneous resource limits. To ensure that the committed regulation remains deliverable, we introduce chance constraints on instantaneous power flexibility based on interactive load forecasts, and apply Value-at-Risk queue-state constraints to maintain sustainable response under cumulative regulation signals. Case studies on a modified IEEE 68-bus system using real data center traces show that the proposed framework lowers system operating costs, enables more viable regulation capacity, and achieves better revenue-risk trade-offs compared to strategies that optimize scheduling and regulation independently.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSFC-Net: A Dual-Encoder Spatial and Frequency Co-Awareness Network for Rural Road Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01278v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate extraction of rural roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery is essential for infrastructure planning and sustainable development. However, this task presents unique challenges in rural settings due to several factors. These include high intra-class variability and low inter-class separability from diverse surface materials, frequent vegetation occlusions that disrupt spatial continuity, and narrow road widths that exacerbate detection difficulties. Existing methods, primarily optimized for structured urban environments, often underperform in these scenarios as they overlook such distinctive characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose DSFC-Net, a dual-encoder framework that synergistically fuses spatial and frequency-domain information. Specifically, a CNN branch is employed to capture fine-grained local road boundaries and short-range continuity, while a novel Spatial-Frequency Hybrid Transformer (SFT) is introduced to robustly model global topological dependencies against vegetation occlusions. Distinct from standard attention mechanisms that suffer from frequency bias, the SFT incorporates a Cross-Frequency Interaction Attention (CFIA) module that explicitly decouples high- and low-frequency information via a Laplacian Pyramid strategy. This design enables the dynamic interaction between spatial details and frequency-aware global contexts, effectively preserving the connectivity of narrow roads. Furthermore, a Channel Feature Fusion Module (CFFM) is proposed to bridge the two branches by adaptively recalibrating channel-wise feature responses, seamlessly integrating local textures with global semantics for accurate segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on the WHU-RuR+, DeepGlobe, and Massachusetts datasets validate the superiority of DSFC-Net over state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Each individual has a default strategy of either cooperating ($C$) or defecting ($D$). Two strategies were tested, including ``tit-for-tat'' (TFT), in which individuals play their opponent's last play, or simply playing their default play. Each individual also has a probability of telling the truth ($0 \leq P_{truth} \leq 1$) about their last play. This parameter, which can evolve over time, allows individuals to be, for instance, a defector but present as a cooperator regarding their last play. This leads to interesting dynamics where mixed populations of defectors and cooperators with $P_{truth} \geq 0.75$ move toward populations of truth-telling cooperators. Likewise, mixed populations with $P_{truth} < 0.7$ become populations of lying defectors. Both such populations are stable because they each have higher average scores than populations with intermediate values of $P_{truth}$. Applications of this model are discussed with regards to both humans and animals.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |

However, their success in vision tasks has been limited due to their causal formulation, which is suitable for sequential text but detrimental in the spatial domain where causality breaks the inherent spatial relationships among pixels or patches. As a result, standard SSMs fail to capture local spatial coherence, often linking non-adjacent patches while ignoring neighboring ones that are visually correlated. To address these limitations, we introduce OCTOPUS , a novel architecture that preserves both global context and local spatial structure within images, while maintaining the linear complexity of SSMs. OCTOPUS performs discrete reoccurrence along eight principal orientations, going forward or backward in the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions, allowing effective information exchange across all spatially connected regions while maintaining independence among unrelated patches. This design enables multi-directional recurrence, capturing both global context and local spatial structure with SSM-level efficiency. In our classification and segmentation benchmarks, OCTOPUS demonstrates notable improvements in boundary preservation and region consistency, as evident from the segmentation results, while maintaining relatively better classification accuracy compared to existing V-SSM based models. These results suggest that OCTOPUS appears as a foundation method for multi-directional recurrence as a scalable and effective mechanism for building spatially aware and computationally efficient vision architectures.</p></details> |  |

We present SpeechLess, a wearable AR assistant that introduces a speech-based intent granularity control paradigm grounded in personalized spatial memory. SpeechLess helps users "speak less," while still obtaining the information they need, and supports gradual explicitation of intent when more complex expression is required. SpeechLess binds prior interactions to multimodal personal context-space, time, activity, and referents-to form spatial memories, and leverages them to extrapolate missing intent dimensions from under-specified user queries. This enables users to dynamically adjust how explicitly they express their informational needs, from full-utterance to micro/zero-utterance interaction. We motivate our design through a week-long formative study using a commercial smart glasses platform, revealing discomfort with public voice use, frustration with repetitive speech, and hardware constraints. Building on these insights, we design SpeechLess, and evaluate it through controlled lab and in-the-wild studies. Our results indicate that regulated speech-based interaction, can improve everyday information access, reduce articulation effort, and support socially acceptable use without substantially degrading perceived usability or intent resolution accuracy across diverse everyday environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures.

| **[HSI-VAR: Rethinking Hyperspectral Restoration through Spatial-Spectral Visual Autoregression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00749v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral images (HSIs) capture richer spatial-spectral information beyond RGB, yet real-world HSIs often suffer from a composite mix of degradations, such as noise, blur, and missing bands. Existing generative approaches for HSI restoration like diffusion models require hundreds of iterative steps, making them computationally impractical for high-dimensional HSIs. While regression models tend to produce oversmoothed results, failing to preserve critical structural details. We break this impasse by introducing HSI-VAR, rethinking HSI restoration as an autoregressive generation problem, where spectral and spatial dependencies can be progressively modeled rather than globally reconstructed. HSI-VAR incorporates three key innovations: (1) Latent-condition alignment, which couples semantic consistency between latent priors and conditional embeddings for precise reconstruction; (2) Degradation-aware guidance, which uniquely encodes mixed degradations as linear combinations in the embedding space for automatic control, remarkably achieving a nearly $50\%$ reduction in computational cost at inference; (3) A spatial-spectral adaptation module that refines details across both domains in the decoding phase. Extensive experiments on nine all-in-one HSI restoration benchmarks confirm HSI-VAR's state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 3.77 dB PSNR improvement on \textbf{\textit{ICVL}} and offering superior structure preservation with an inference speed-up of up to $95.5 \times$ compared with diffusion-based methods, making it a highly practical solution for real-world HSI restoration.</p></details> |  |

For flow-matching VLA policies, this degradation is closely associated with the erosion of spatial inductive bias during RL adaptation, as sparse rewards and spatially agnostic exploration increasingly favor short-horizon visual cues. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{SA-VLA}, a spatially-aware RL adaptation framework that preserves spatial grounding during policy optimization by aligning representation learning, reward design, and exploration with task geometry. SA-VLA fuses implicit spatial representations with visual tokens, provides dense rewards that reflect geometric progress, and employs \textbf{SCAN}, a spatially-conditioned annealed exploration strategy tailored to flow-matching dynamics. Across challenging multi-object and cluttered manipulation benchmarks, SA-VLA enables stable RL fine-tuning and improves zero-shot spatial generalization, yielding more robust and transferable behaviors.

As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO (spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures (including supplementary information, 7 pages, 1 figure)</p></details> |

However, their movements within the intimate near-body space raise unresolved challenges for perceived safety, user control, and trust. In this paper, we present results from a Wizard-of-Oz study (n=18), where participants completed near-body collaboration tasks with SRLs to explore these challenges. We collected qualitative data through think-aloud protocols and semi-structured interviews, complemented by physiological signals and post-task ratings. Findings indicate that greater autonomy did not inherently enhance perceived safety or trust. Instead, participants identified near-body zones and paired them with clear coordination rules. They also expressed expectations for how different arm components should behave, shaping preferences around autonomy, perceived safety, and trust. Building on these insights, we introduce SRL Proxemics, a zone- and segment-level design framework showing that autonomy is not monolithic: perceived safety hinges on spatially calibrated, legible behaviors, not higher autonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CHI 2026.

Although recent deep learning methods have achieved notable progress, they still suffer from limited receptive fields, redundant spectral bands, and the quadratic complexity of self-attention, which restrict both efficiency and robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Hierarchical Spatial-Spectral Dense Correlation Network (HSSDCT). The framework introduces two key modules: (i) a Hierarchical Dense-Residue Transformer Block (HDRTB) that progressively enlarges windows and employs dense-residue connections for multi-scale feature aggregation, and (ii) a Spatial-Spectral Correlation Layer (SSCL) that explicitly factorizes spatial and spectral dependencies, reducing self-attention to linear complexity while mitigating spectral redundancy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HSSDCT delivers superior reconstruction quality with significantly lower computational costs, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in HSI fusion.

| **[Evaluating Spatialized Auditory Cues for Rapid Attention Capture in XR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21264v2)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time-critical eXtended reality (XR) scenarios where users must rapidly reorient their attention to hazards, alerts, or instructions while engaged in a primary task, spatial audio can provide an immediate directional cue without occupying visual bandwidth. However, such scenarios can afford only a brief auditory exposure, requiring users to interpret sound direction quickly and without extended listening or head-driven refinement. This paper reports a controlled exploratory study of rapid spatial-audio localization in XR. Using HRTF-rendered broadband stimuli presented from a semi-dense set of directions around the listener, we quantify how accurately users can infer coarse direction from brief audio alone. We further examine the effects of short-term visuo-auditory feedback training as a lightweight calibration mechanism. Our findings show that brief spatial cues can convey coarse directional information, and that even short calibration can improve users' perception of aural signals. While these results highlight the potential of spatial audio for rapid attention guidance, they also show that auditory cues alone may not provide sufficient precision for complex or high-stakes tasks, and that spatial audio may be most effective when complemented by other sensory modalities or visual cues, without relying on head-driven refinement. We leverage this study on spatial audio as a preliminary investigation into a first-stage attention-guidance channel for wearable XR (e.g., VR head-mounted displays and AR smart glasses), and provide design insights on stimulus selection and calibration for time-critical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures.

| **[SCR2-ST: Combine Single Cell with Spatial Transcriptomics for Efficient Active Sampling via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13635v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is an emerging technology that enables researchers to investigate the molecular relationships underlying tissue morphology. However, acquiring ST data remains prohibitively expensive, and traditional fixed-grid sampling strategies lead to redundant measurements of morphologically similar or biologically uninformative regions, thus resulting in scarce data that constrain current methods. The well-established single-cell sequencing field, however, could provide rich biological data as an effective auxiliary source to mitigate this limitation. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SCR2-ST, a unified framework that leverages single-cell prior knowledge to guide efficient data acquisition and accurate expression prediction. SCR2-ST integrates a single-cell guided reinforcement learning-based (SCRL) active sampling and a hybrid regression-retrieval prediction network SCR2Net. SCRL combines single-cell foundation model embeddings with spatial density information to construct biologically grounded reward signals, enabling selective acquisition of informative tissue regions under constrained sequencing budgets. SCR2Net then leverages the actively sampled data through a hybrid architecture combining regression-based modeling with retrieval-augmented inference, where a majority cell-type filtering mechanism suppresses noisy matches and retrieved expression profiles serve as soft labels for auxiliary supervision. We evaluated SCR2-ST on three public ST datasets, demonstrating SOTA performance in both sampling efficiency and prediction accuracy, particularly under low-budget scenarios. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/hrlblab/SCR2ST</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Over Scale: Learning Spatial Reasoning from Educational Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23251v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance on standard video understanding benchmarks yet fail systematically on simple reasoning tasks that preschool children can solve, including counting, spatial reasoning, and compositional understanding. We hypothesize that the pedagogically-structured content of educational videos provides an ideal training signal for improving these capabilities. We introduce DoraVQA, a dataset of 5,344 question-answer pairs automatically extracted from 8 seasons of Dora the Explorer with precise timestamp alignment. Each episode follows a consistent \textit{context-question-pause-answer} structure that creates a self-contained learning environment analogous to interactive tutoring. We fine-tune both Qwen2 and Qwen3 using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), leveraging the clear correctness signals and structured reasoning traces inherent in educational content. Despite training exclusively on 38 hours of children's educational videos, our approach achieves improvements of 8-14 points on DoraVQA and state-of-the-art 86.16\% on CVBench, with strong transfer to Video-MME and NExT-QA, demonstrating effective generalization from narrow pedagogical content to broad multimodal understanding. Through cross-domain benchmarks, we show that VLMs can perform tasks that require robust reasoning learned from structured educational content, suggesting that content structure matters as much as content scale.</p></details> |  |

We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically, ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints, ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence.

Recently, adopted event oriented multi-track methods affect the generality in polyphonic environments due to the limitation of the number of tracks. To enhance the generality in polyphonic environments, we propose Spatial Mapping and Regression Localization for SELD (SMRL-SELD). SMRL-SELD segments the 3D spatial space, mapping it to a 2D plane, and a new regression localization loss is proposed to help the results converge toward the location of the corresponding event. SMRL-SELD is location-oriented, allowing the model to learn event features based on orientation. Thus, the method enables the model to process polyphonic sounds regardless of the number of overlapping events. We conducted experiments on STARSS23 and STARSS22 datasets and our proposed SMRL-SELD outperforms the existing SELD methods in overall evaluation and polyphony environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ICME 2025</p></details> |

FloorplanQA is grounded in structured representations of indoor scenes, such as (e.g., kitchens, living rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, and others), encoded symbolically in JSON or XML layouts. The benchmark covers core spatial tasks, including distance measurement, visibility, path finding, and object placement within constrained spaces. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial LLMs reveal that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to respect physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, though they remain mostly robust to small spatial perturbations. FloorplanQA uncovers a blind spot in today's LLMs: inconsistent reasoning about indoor layouts. We hope this benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3, P...</summary><p>v3, Project page: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.07644</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Strategies for Repulsive Spatial Point Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15133v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is increasing interest to develop Bayesian inferential algorithms for point process models with intractable likelihoods. A purpose of this paper is to illustrate the utility of using simulation based strategies, including Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for this task. Shirota and Gelfand (2017) proposed an extended version of an ABC approach for Repulsive Spatial Point Processes (RSPP), but their algorithm was not correctly detailed. In this paper, we correct their method and, based on this, we propose a new ABC-MCMC algorithm to which Markov property is introduced compared to a typical ABC method. Though it is generally impractical to use, Monte Carlo approximations can be leveraged for intractable terms. Another aspect of this paper is to explore the use of the exchange algorithm and the noisy Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Alquier et al., 2016) on RSPP. Comparisons to ABC-MCMC methods are also provided. We find that the inferential approaches outlined above yield good performance for RSPP in both simulated and real data applications and should be considered as viable approaches for the analysis of these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Motivated by the spatial bias inherent in effective receptive fields (ERFs), we theoretically demonstrate that structurally re-parameterized blocks induce spatially varying learning rates that are crucial for convergence. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Rep3D, a framework that employs a lightweight modulation network to generate receptive-biased scaling masks, adaptively re-weighting kernel updates within a plain encoder architecture. This approach unifies spatial inductive bias with optimization-aware learning, avoiding the complexity of multi-branch designs while ensuring robust local-to-global convergence. Extensive evaluations on five 3D segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that Rep3D consistently outperforms state-of-the-art transformer and fixed-prior baselines.

| **[Multi-target DoA estimation with a single Rydberg atomic receiver by spectral analysis of spatially-resolved fluorescence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22704v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rydberg-based Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation has been hampered by the complexity of receiver arrays and the single-target, narrow-band limitations of existing single-receiver methods. This paper introduces a novel approach that addresses these limitations. We demonstrate that by spatially resolving the fluorescence profile along the vapor cell, the multi-target problem can be effectively solved. Our approach hinges on the insight that by superimposing incoming signals with a strong local oscillator (LO), the complex atomic absorption pattern is linearized into a simple superposition of sinusoids. In this new representation, each spatial frequency uniquely and directly maps to the DoA of a target. This reduces the multi-target challenge into a spectral estimation problem, which we address using Prony's method. Our approach, termed Imaging-based Spectral Estimation (ISE), inherently supports multi-target detection and restores the full broadband capability of the sensor by removing the restrictive cell-length dependency. This development also shows potential for realizing multi-channel Rydberg receivers and the continuous-aperture sensing required for holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). We develop a comprehensive theoretical model, derive the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) as a performance benchmark, and present simulations validating the effectiveness of the approach to resolve multiple targets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A spatiotemporal fused network considering electrode spatial topology and time-window transition for MDD detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08521v4)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, researchers have begun to experiment with deep learning-based methods for detecting major depressive disor-der (MDD) using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in search of a more objective means of diagnosis. However, exist-ing spatiotemporal feature extraction methods only consider the functional correlation between multiple electrodes and temporal correlation of EEG signals, ignoring the spatial posi-tion connection information between electrodes and the conti-nuity between time windows, which reduces the model's fea-ture extraction capabilities. To address this issue, a Spatio-temporal fused network for MDD detection with Electrode spatial Topology and adjacent TIME-window transition in-formation (SET-TIME) is proposed in this study. SET-TIME is composed by a common feature extractor, a secondary time-correlation feature extractor, and a domain adaptation (DA) module, in which the former extractor is used to obtain the temporal and spatial features, and the latter extractor can mine the correlation between multiple time windows, and the DA module is adopted to enhance cross-subject detection ca-pability. The experimental results of 10-fold cross-validation show that the proposed SET-TIME method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by achieving MDD detection accuracies of 92.00% and 94.00% on the public datasets PRED+CT and MODMA, respectively. Ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the multiple modules in SET-TIME, which assist in MDD detection by exploring the intrin-sic spatiotemporal information of EEG signals.</p></details> | 21pages, 8 figures |
| **[TTSA3R: Training-Free Temporal-Spatial Adaptive Persistent State for Streaming 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22615v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Streaming recurrent models enable efficient 3D reconstruction by maintaining persistent state representations. However, they suffer from catastrophic memory forgetting over long sequences due to balancing historical information with new observations. Recent methods alleviate this by deriving adaptive signals from attention perspective, but they operate on single dimensions without considering temporal and spatial consistency. To this end, we propose a training-free framework termed TTSA3R that leverages both temporal state evolution and spatial observation quality for adaptive state updates in 3D reconstruction. In particular, we devise a Temporal Adaptive Update Module that regulates update magnitude by analyzing temporal state evolution patterns. Then, a Spatial Contextual Update Module is introduced to localize spatial regions that require updates through observation-state alignment and scene dynamics. These complementary signals are finally fused to determine the state updating strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TTSA3R in diverse 3D tasks. Moreover, our method exhibits only 15% error increase compared to over 200% degradation in baseline models on extended sequences, significantly improving long-term reconstruction stability. Our codes will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

However, existing multimodal models predominantly treat this task as a black-box classification, often confusing physically distinct motions by relying on superficial visual patterns rather than geometric cues. We present CamReasoner, a framework that reformulates camera movement understanding as a structured inference process to bridge the gap between perception and cinematic logic. Our approach centers on the Observation-Thinking-Answer (O-T-A) paradigm, which compels the model to decode spatio-temporal cues such as trajectories and view frustums within an explicit reasoning block. To instill this capability, we construct a Large-scale Inference Trajectory Suite comprising 18k SFT reasoning chains and 38k RL feedback samples. Notably, we are the first to employ RL for logical alignment in this domain, ensuring motion inferences are grounded in physical geometry rather than contextual guesswork. By applying Reinforcement Learning to the Observation-Think-Answer (O-T-A) reasoning paradigm, CamReasoner effectively suppresses hallucinations and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

We focus on achieving robust spatial generalization of the policy for the peg-in-hole (PiH) task trained from a small number of demonstrations. We propose EquiContact, a hierarchical policy composed of a high-level vision planner (Diffusion Equivariant Descriptor Field, Diff-EDF) and a novel low-level compliant visuomotor policy (Geometric Compliant ACT, G-CompACT). G-CompACT operates using only localized observations (geometrically consistent error vectors (GCEV), force-torque readings, and wrist-mounted RGB images) and produces actions defined in the end-effector frame. Through these design choices, we show that the entire EquiContact pipeline is SE(3)-equivariant, from perception to force control. We also outline three key components for spatially generalizable contact-rich policies: compliance, localized policies, and induced equivariance. Real-world experiments on PiH, screwing, and surface wiping tasks demonstrate a near-perfect success rate and robust generalization to unseen spatial configurations, validating the proposed framework and principles.

Recent graph-based models leverage spatial relationships between Wire-less Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Access Points (APs) and devices, offering finer localization granularity, but fall short in quantifying prediction uncertainty, a key requirement for real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Graph Transformer (SAC-GT), a framework for accurate and reliable indoor localization. SAC-GT integrates a Graph Transformer (GT) model that captures network's spatial topology and signal strength dynamics, with a novel Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Prediction (SACP) method that provides region-specific uncertainty estimates. This allows SAC-GT to produce not only precise two-dimensional (2D) location predictions but also statistically valid confidence regions tailored to varying environmental conditions. Extensive evaluations on a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed SAC-GT solution achieves state-of-the-art localization accuracy while delivering robust and spatially adaptive reliability guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ICC 2026</p></details> |

This is typically achieved through visual representations of a virtual body; however, visual modalities are not always available, such as when users interact with agents using headphones or display-less glasses. In this work, we explore auditory embodiment. By introducing auditory cues of bodily presence - through spatially localized voice and situated Foley audio from environmental interactions - we investigate how audio alone can convey embodiment and influence perceptions of a conversational agent. We conducted a 2 (spatialization: monaural vs. spatialized) x 2 (Foley: none vs. Foley) within-subjects study, where participants (n=24) engaged in conversations with agents. Our results show that spatialization and Foley increase co-presence, but reduce users' perceptions of the agent's attention and other social attributes.</p></details> |  |

Within this framework we posit AI hallucinations as diagnostic tools. By formalizing the \textbf{Cognitive Friction} ($C_f$) it is possible to reveal "Phantom Affordances", i.e. semiotic ambiguities in built space.

Owing to the vast spatial scale and high semantic ambiguity of remote sensing scenes, these descriptions often rely heavily on positional cues, posing unique challenges for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in spatial reasoning. To leverage this unique feature, we propose a reasoning-guided, position-aware post-training framework, dubbed \textbf{RSGround-R1}, to progressively enhance spatial understanding. Specifically, we first introduce Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) using synthetically generated RSVG reasoning data to establish explicit position awareness. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) is then applied, augmented by our newly designed positional reward that provides continuous and distance-aware guidance toward accurate localization. Moreover, to mitigate incoherent localization behaviors across rollouts, we introduce a spatial consistency guided optimization scheme that dynamically adjusts policy updates based on their spatial coherence, ensuring stable and robust convergence. Extensive experiments on RSVG benchmarks demonstrate superior performance and generalization of our model.</p></details> |  |

This leads to a dual role of the eyes as a means of sensing and communication. Accordingly, artificial eye models are being explored as communication media in human-machine interaction scenarios. One challenge in the use of eye models for communication consists of resolving spatial reference ambiguities, especially for screen-based models. To address this challenge, we introduce an approach that incorporates reflection-like features that are contingent on the movements of artificial eyes. We conducted a user study with 30 participants in which participants had to use spatial references provided by dynamic eye models to advance in a fast-paced group interaction task. Compared to a non-reflective eye model and a pure reflection mode, the superimposition of screen-based eyes with gaze-contingent virtual reflections resulted in a higher identification accuracy and user experience, suggesting a synergistic benefit.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems.

These critical aspects are largely overlooked by current benchmarks due to their short or information-sparse prompt design. In this paper, we introduce SpatialGenEval, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial intelligence of T2I models, covering two key aspects: (1) SpatialGenEval involves 1,230 long, information-dense prompts across 25 real-world scenes. Each prompt integrates 10 spatial sub-domains and corresponding 10 multi-choice question-answer pairs, ranging from object position and layout to occlusion and causality. Our extensive evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art models reveals that higher-order spatial reasoning remains a primary bottleneck. (2) To demonstrate that the utility of our information-dense design goes beyond simple evaluation, we also construct the SpatialT2I dataset. It contains 15,400 text-image pairs with rewritten prompts to ensure image consistency while preserving information density. Fine-tuned results on current foundation models (i.e., Stable Diffusion-XL, Uniworld-V1, OmniGen2) yield consistent performance gains (+4.2%, +5.7%, +4.4%) and more realistic effects in spatial relations, highlighting a data-centric paradigm to achieve spatial intelligence in T2I models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026, URL: https://github.com/AMAP-ML/SpatialGenEval</p></details> |

This limitation stems largely from current models' reliance on mono audio datasets, which lack the binaural spatial information needed to learn visual-to-spatial audio mappings. To address this gap, we introduce two key contributions: we construct BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset designed to support spatially aware video-to-audio generation; and we propose a end-to-end spatial audio generation framework guided by visual cues, which explicitly models spatial features. Our framework incorporates a visual-guided audio spatialization module that ensures the generated audio exhibits realistic spatial attributes and layered spatial depth while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment. Experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial fidelity and delivers a more immersive auditory experience, without sacrificing temporal or semantic consistency.

| **[FireFly-S: Exploiting Dual-Side Sparsity for Spiking Neural Networks Acceleration with Reconfigurable Spatial Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15578v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with brain-inspired structure using discrete spikes instead of continuous activations, are gaining attention for their efficient processing on neuromorphic chips. While current SNN hardware accelerators often prioritize temporal spike sparsity, exploiting sparse synaptic weights offers significant untapped potential for even greater efficiency. To address this, we propose FireFly-S, a Sparse extension of the FireFly series. This co-optimized software-hardware design focuses on leveraging dual-side sparsity for acceleration. On the software side, we propose a algorithmic optimization framework that combines gradient rewiring for pruning and modified Learned Step Size Quantization (LSQ) for SNNs, achieving a weight sparsity exceeding 85\% and enabling efficient 4-bit quantization with negligible accuracy loss. On the hardware side, we present an efficient dual-side sparsity detector employing a Bitmap-based sparse decoding logic to pinpoint the positions of non-zero weights and input spikes. The logic allows for direct bypassing of redundant computations, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Different from the overlay architecture adopted by previous FireFly series, we adopt a parametric spatial architecture with inter-layer pipelining that can fully exploit the fine-grained programmability and reconfigurability of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), enabling fast deployment for various models. A spatial-temporal dataflow is also proposed to support such inter-layer pipelining and avoid long-term temporal dependencies. In experiments conducted on the MNIST, DVS-Gesture and CIFAR-10 datasets, the FireFly-S model achieves 85--95\% sparsity with 4-bit quantization and the hardware accelerator effectively leverages the dual-side sparsity, delivering performance metrics of 10,047~FPS/W on MNIST, 3,683~FPS/W on DVS-Gesture, and 2,327~FPS/W on CIFAR-10.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures.

Existing spatial audio models, conversely, are constrained to fixed microphone geometries, preventing deployment across diverse devices. We present PhaseCoder, a transformer-only spatial audio encoder that is agnostic to microphone geometry. PhaseCoder takes raw multichannel audio and microphone coordinates as inputs to perform localization and produces robust spatial embeddings. We demonstrate that Gemma 3n LLM can be fine-tuned to reason over "Spatial Audio Tokens" produced by PhaseCoder. We show our encoder achieves state-of-the-art results on microphone-invariant localization benchmarks and, for the first time, enables an LLM to perform complex spatial reasoning and targeted transcription tasks from an arbitrary microphone array.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel method for online source counting by detecting changes in the number of active sources based on spatial coherence. The proposed method exploits the fact that a single coherent source in spatially white background noise yields high spatial coherence, whereas only noise results in low spatial coherence. By applying a spatial whitening operation, the source counting problem is reformulated as a change detection task, aiming to identify the time frames when the number of active sources changes. The method leverages the generalized magnitude-squared coherence as a measure to quantify spatial coherence, providing features for a compact neural network trained to detect source count changes framewise. Simulation results with binaural hearing aids in reverberant acoustic scenes with up to 4 speakers and background noise demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for online source counting.</p></details> | <details><summary>in Pr...</summary><p>in Proc.

Recent research has trained deep SNN models with accuracy on par with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Although the event-driven and sparse nature of SNNs show potential for more energy efficient computation than ANNs, SNN neurons have internal states which evolve over time. Keeping track of SNN states can significantly increase data movement and storage requirements, potentially losing its advantages with respect to ANNs. This paper investigates the energy effects of having neuron states, and how it is influenced by the chosen mapping to realistic hardware architectures with advanced memory hierarchies. Therefore, we develop STEMS, a mapping design space exploration for SNNs. STEMS models SNN's stateful behavior and explores intra-layer and inter-layer mapping optimizations to minimize data movement, considering both spatial and temporal SNN dimensions. Using STEMS, we show up to 12x reduction in off-chip data movement and 5x reduction in energy (on top of intra-layer optimizations), on two event-based vision SNN benchmarks. Finally, neuron states may not be needed for all SNN layers. By optimizing neuron states for one of our benchmarks, we show 20x reduction in neuron states and 1.4x better performance without accuracy loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 23 figures, under review at IEEE TC</p></details> |
| **[Effective Sample Size for Functional Spatial Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20812v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effective sample size quantifies the amount of independent information contained in a dataset, accounting for redundancy due to correlation between observations. While widely used in geostatistics for scalar data, its extension to functional spatial data has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel definition of the effective sample size for functional geostatistical data, employing the trace-covariogram as a measure of correlation, and show that it retains the intuitive properties of the classical scalar ESS. We illustrate the behavior of this measure using a functional autoregressive process, demonstrating how serial dependence and the allocation of variability across eigen-directions influence the resulting functional ESS. Finally, the approach is applied to a real meteorological dataset of geometric vertical velocities over a portion of the Earth, showing how the method can quantify redundancy and determine the effective number of independent curves in functional spatial datasets.</p></details> |  |

Extrapolating extreme events beyond the range of the data is not obvious and requires advanced tools based on extreme value theory. Furthermore, the complexity of risk assessments often requires the inclusion of multiple variables. Extreme value theory provides very important tools for the analysis of multivariate or spatial extreme events, but these are not easily accessible to professionals without appropriate expertise. This article provides a minimal background on multivariate and spatial extremes and gives simple yet thorough instructions on how to analyse high-dimensional extremes using the R package ExtremalDep. After briefly introducing the statistical methodologies, we focus on road testing the package's toolbox through several real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Learning-based Framework for Spatial Impulse Response Compensation in 3D Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20291v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a promising imaging modality that combines the advantages of optical contrast with ultrasound detection. Utilizing ultrasound transducers with larger surface areas can improve detection sensitivity. However, when computationally efficient analytic reconstruction methods that neglect the spatial impulse responses (SIRs) of the transducer are employed, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images will be compromised. Although optimization-based reconstruction methods can explicitly account for SIR effects, their computational cost is generally high, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) applications. To address the need for accurate but rapid 3D PACT image reconstruction, this study presents a framework for establishing a learned SIR compensation method that operates in the data domain. The learned compensation method maps SIR-corrupted PACT measurement data to compensated data that would have been recorded by idealized point-like transducers. Subsequently, the compensated data can be used with a computationally efficient reconstruction method that neglects SIR effects. Two variants of the learned compensation model are investigated that employ a U-Net model and a specifically designed, physics-inspired model, referred to as Deconv-Net. A fast and analytical training data generation procedure is also a component of the presented framework. The framework is rigorously validated in virtual imaging studies, demonstrating resolution improvement and robustness to noise variations, object complexity, and sound speed heterogeneity. When applied to in-vivo breast imaging data, the learned compensation models revealed fine structures that had been obscured by SIR-induced artifacts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of learned SIR compensation in 3D PACT imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE TMI</p></details> |

Existing methods often fail to capture traffic's inherent chaotic nature for effective few-shot learning. We propose CAST-CKT, a novel Chaos-Aware Spatio-Temporal and Cross-City Knowledge Transfer framework. It employs an efficient chaotic analyser to quantify traffic predictability regimes, driving several key innovations: chaos-aware attention for regime-adaptive temporal modelling; adaptive topology learning for dynamic spatial dependencies; and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment for knowledge transfer. The framework also provides horizon-specific predictions with uncertainty quantification. Theoretical analysis shows improved generalisation bounds. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks in cross-city few-shot settings show CAST-CKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in MAE and RMSE, while offering interpretable regime analysis.

While classical quickest change detection methods provide strong guarantees on detection delay and false-alarm rates, existing approaches for point-process data predominantly focus on temporal changes and do not explicitly infer affected spatial regions. We propose a likelihood-free, score-based detection framework that jointly estimates the change time and the change region in continuous space-time without assuming parametric knowledge of the pre- or post-change dynamics. The method leverages a localized and conditionally weighted Hyvärinen score to quantify event-level deviations from nominal behavior and aggregates these scores using a spatio-temporal CUSUM-type statistic over a prescribed class of spatial regions. Operating sequentially, the procedure outputs both a stopping time and an estimated change region, enabling real-time detection with spatial interpretability. We establish theoretical guarantees on false-alarm control, detection delay, and spatial localization accuracy, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through simulations and real-world spatio-temporal event data.</p></details> |  |

We present a case study on short-term forecasting of daily maximum temperature and precipitation across the conterminous United States using novel scalable spatio-temporal Gaussian process methodology. Building on three approximation families - inducing-point methods (FITC), Vecchia approximations, and a hybrid Vecchia-inducing-point full-scale approach (VIF) - we introduce three extensions that address key bottlenecks in large space-time settings: (i) a scalable correlation-based neighbor selection strategy for Vecchia approximations with point-referenced data, enabling accurate conditioning under complex dependence structures, (ii) a space-time kMeans++ inducing-point selection algorithm, and (iii) GPU-accelerated implementations of computationally expensive operations, including matrix operations and neighbor searches. Using both synthetic experiments and a large NOAA station dataset containing approximately 1.7 million space-time observations, we analyze the models with respect to predictive performance, parameter estimation, and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate that scalable Gaussian process models can yield accurate continental-scale forecasts while remaining computationally feasible, offering practical tools for weather applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[UrbanGraph: Physics-Informed Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Heterogeneous Graphs for Urban Microclimate Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00457v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical, as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this, we introduce UrbanGraph, a framework founded on a novel structure-based inductive bias. Unlike implicit graph learning, UrbanGraph transforms physical first principles into a dynamic causal topology, explicitly encoding time-varying causalities (e.g., shading and convection) directly into the graph structure to ensure physical consistency and data efficiency. Results show that UrbanGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance across all baselines. Specifically, the use of explicit causal pruning significantly reduces the model's floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 73.8% and increases training speed by 21% compared to implicit graphs. Our contribution includes the first high-resolution benchmark for spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and a generalizable explicit topological encoding paradigm applicable to urban spatio-temporal dynamics governed by known physical equations.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we present USS-Nav, a lightweight framework that incrementally constructs a Unified Spatio-Semantic scene graph and enables efficient Large Language Model (LLM)-augmented Zero-Shot Object Navigation in unknown environments. Specifically, we introduce an incremental Spatial Connectivity Graph generation method utilizing polyhedral expansion to capture global geometric topology, which is dynamically partitioned into semantic regions via graph clustering. Concurrently, open-vocabulary object semantics are instantiated and anchored to this topology to form a hierarchical environmental representation. Leveraging this hierarchical structure, we present a coarse-to-fine exploration strategy: LLM grounded in the scene graph's semantics to determine global target regions, while a local planner optimizes frontier coverage based on information gain. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational efficiency and real-time update frequency (15 Hz) on a resource-constrained platform. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our framework, showing substantial improvements in Success weighted by Path Length (SPL). The source code will be made publicly available to foster further research.</p></details> |  |

Recent generative models have shown promise in accelerating simulations, yet they struggle with long-horizon generation due to architectural constraints, error accumulation, and inadequate modeling of spatio-temporal dynamics. We present STAR-MD (Spatio-Temporal Autoregressive Rollout for Molecular Dynamics), a scalable SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that generates physically plausible protein trajectories over microsecond timescales. Our key innovation is a causal diffusion transformer with joint spatio-temporal attention that efficiently captures complex space-time dependencies while avoiding the memory bottlenecks of existing methods. On the standard ATLAS benchmark, STAR-MD achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics--substantially improving conformational coverage, structural validity, and dynamic fidelity compared to previous methods. STAR-MD successfully extrapolates to generate stable microsecond-scale trajectories where baseline methods fail catastrophically, maintaining high structural quality throughout the extended rollout. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals severe limitations in current models for long-horizon generation, while demonstrating that STAR-MD's joint spatio-temporal modeling enables robust dynamics simulation at biologically relevant timescales, paving the way for accelerated exploration of protein function.</p></details> | <details><summary>For a...</summary><p>For associated project page, see https://bytedance-seed.github.io/ConfRover/starmd</p></details> |
| **[PIMCST: Physics-Informed Multi-Phase Consensus and Spatio-Temporal Few-Shot Learning for Traffic Flow Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01936v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic flow prediction remains a fundamental challenge in intelligent transportation systems, particularly in cross-domain, data-scarce scenarios where limited historical data hinders model training and generalisation. The complex spatio-temporal dependencies and nonlinear dynamics of urban mobility networks further complicate few-shot learning across different cities. This paper proposes MCPST, a novel Multi-phase Consensus Spatio-Temporal framework for few-shot traffic forecasting that reconceptualises traffic prediction as a multi-phase consensus learning problem. Our framework introduces three core innovations: (1) a multi-phase engine that models traffic dynamics through diffusion, synchronisation, and spectral embeddings for comprehensive dynamic characterisation; (2) an adaptive consensus mechanism that dynamically fuses phase-specific predictions while enforcing consistency; and (3) a structured meta-learning strategy for rapid adaptation to new cities with minimal data. We establish extensive theoretical guarantees, including representation theorems with bounded approximation errors and generalisation bounds for few-shot adaptation. Through experiments on four real-world datasets, MCPST outperforms fourteen state-of-the-art methods in spatio-temporal graph learning methods, dynamic graph transfer learning methods, prompt-based spatio-temporal prediction methods and cross-domain few-shot settings, improving prediction accuracy while reducing required training data and providing interpretable insights.

| **[LaST$_{0}$: Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought for Robotic Vision-Language-Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05248v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown strong generalization, with some approaches seeking to explicitly generate linguistic reasoning traces or predict future observations prior to execution. However, explicit reasoning typically incurs non-negligible inference latency, which constrains the temporal resolution required for robotic manipulation. Moreover, such reasoning is confined to the linguistic space, imposing a representational bottleneck that struggles to faithfully capture ineffable physical attributes. To mitigate these limitations, we propose LaST$_0$, a framework that enables efficient reasoning before acting through a Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought (CoT), capturing fine-grained physical and robotic dynamics that are often difficult to verbalize. Specifically, we introduce a token-efficient latent CoT space that models future visual dynamics, 3D structural information, and robot proprioceptive states, and further extends these representations across time to enable temporally consistent implicit reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, LaST$_0$ adopts a dual-system architecture implemented via a Mixture-of-Transformers design, where a reasoning expert conducts low-frequency latent inference and an acting expert generates high-frequency actions conditioned on robotics-oriented latent representations. To facilitate coordination, LaST$_0$ is trained with heterogeneous operation frequencies, enabling adaptive switching during deployment. Across 10 real-world tasks spanning tabletop, mobile, and dexterous hand manipulation, LaST$_0$ improves mean success rates by 13%, 14% and 14% over prior SOTA VLA methods, respectively.</p></details> |  |

The majority of existing placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models. In addition, we developed a novel GP inference method -- the Vanilla SPDE Exchange (VaSE) -- to boost the GP posterior sampling efficiency, which is also of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Transformers for Long-Term NDVI Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01799v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term satellite image time series (SITS) analysis in heterogeneous landscapes faces significant challenges, particularly in Mediterranean regions where complex spatial patterns, seasonal variations, and multi-decade environmental changes interact across different scales. This paper presents the Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Long Term Forecasting (STT-LTF ), an extended framework that advances beyond purely temporal analysis to integrate spatial context modeling with temporal sequence prediction. STT-LTF processes multi-scale spatial patches alongside temporal sequences (up to 20 years) through a unified transformer architecture, capturing both local neighborhood relationships and regional climate influences. The framework employs comprehensive self-supervised learning with spatial masking, temporal masking, and horizon sampling strategies, enabling robust model training from 40 years of unlabeled Landsat imagery. Unlike autoregressive approaches, STT-LTF directly predicts arbitrary future time points without error accumulation, incorporating spatial patch embeddings, cyclical temporal encoding, and geographic coordinates to learn complex dependencies across heterogeneous Mediterranean ecosystems. Experimental evaluation on Landsat data (1984-2024) demonstrates that STT-LTF achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0328 and R^2 of 0.8412 for next-year predictions, outperforming traditional statistical methods, CNN-based approaches, LSTM networks, and standard transformers. The framework's ability to handle irregular temporal sampling and variable prediction horizons makes it particularly suitable for analysis of heterogeneous landscapes experiencing rapid ecological transitions.</p></details> |  |

We propose CaST: Causal Discovery via Spatio-Temporal Graphs, a unified framework for causal discovery in disaster domain that integrates semantic similarity and spatio-temporal proximity using Large Language Models (LLMs) pretrained on disaster datasets. CaST constructs an event graph for each window of tweets. Each event extracted from tweets is represented as a node embedding enriched with its contextual semantics, geographic coordinates, and temporal features. These event nodes are then connected to form a spatio-temporal event graph, which is processed using a multi-head Graph Attention Network (GAT) \cite{gat} to learn directed causal relationships. We construct an in-house dataset of approximately 167K disaster-related tweets collected during Hurricane Harvey and annotated following the MAVEN-ERE schema. Experimental results show that CaST achieves superior performance over both traditional and state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies further confirm that incorporating spatial and temporal signals substantially improves both recall and stability during training. Overall, CaST demonstrates that integrating spatio-temporal reasoning into event graphs enables more robust and interpretable causal discovery in disaster-related social media text.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages a 4-dimensional spatio-temporal planner, integrated with vision-based Safe Flight Corridor (SFC) generation and trajectory optimization. Unlike prior methods that rely on map fusion, our framework is mapless, enabling collision avoidance directly from perception while reducing computational overhead. Dynamic obstacles are detected and tracked using a vision-based object segmentation and tracking pipeline, allowing robust classification of static versus dynamic elements in the scene. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a backup planning module that reactively avoids dynamic obstacles when no direct path to the goal is available, mitigating the risk of collisions during deadlock situations. We validate our method extensively in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments, and benchmark it against state-of-the-art approaches, showing significant advantages for reactive UAV navigation in dynamic, unknown environments.</p></details> |  |

Maps of Dynamics (MoDs) provide such models by encoding statistical motion patterns in a map, but existing representations use discrete spatial sampling and typically require costly offline construction. We propose a continuous spatio-temporal MoD representation based on implicit neural functions that directly map coordinates to the parameters of a Semi-Wrapped Gaussian Mixture Model. This removes the need for discretization and imputation for unevenly sampled regions, enabling smooth generalization across both space and time. Evaluated on two public datasets with real-world people tracking data, our method achieves better accuracy of motion representation and smoother velocity distributions in sparse regions while still being computationally efficient, compared to available baselines. The proposed approach demonstrates a powerful and efficient way of modeling complex human motion patterns and high performance in the trajectory prediction downstream task.

Yet, while Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) master static semantics, their grasp of temporal dynamics remains brittle. We present TimeBlind, a diagnostic benchmark for compositional spatio-temporal understanding. Inspired by cognitive science, TimeBlind categorizes fine-grained temporal understanding into three levels: recognizing atomic events, characterizing event properties, and reasoning about event interdependencies. Unlike benchmarks that conflate recognition with temporal reasoning, TimeBlind leverages a minimal-pairs paradigm: video pairs share identical static visual content but differ solely in temporal structure, utilizing complementary questions to neutralize language priors. Evaluating over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro) on 600 curated instances (2400 video-question pairs), reveals that the Instance Accuracy (correctly distinguishing both videos in a pair) of the best performing MLLM is only 48.2%, far below the human performance (98.2%).

| **[Securing Time in Energy IoT: A Clock-Dynamics-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network for Clock Drift Attacks and Y2K38 Failures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23147v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integrity of time in distributed Internet of Things (IoT) devices is crucial for reliable operation in energy cyber-physical systems, such as smart grids and microgrids. However, IoT systems are vulnerable to clock drift, time-synchronization manipulation, and timestamp discontinuities, such as the Year 2038 (Y2K38) Unix overflow, all of which disrupt temporal ordering. Conventional anomaly-detection models, which assume reliable timestamps, fail to capture temporal inconsistencies. This paper introduces STGAT (Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network), a framework that models both temporal distortion and inter-device consistency in energy IoT systems. STGAT combines drift-aware temporal embeddings and temporal self-attention to capture corrupted time evolution at individual devices, and uses graph attention to model spatial propagation of timing errors. A curvature-regularized latent representation geometrically separates normal clock evolution from anomalies caused by drift, synchronization offsets, and overflow events. Experimental results on energy IoT telemetry with controlled timing perturbations show that STGAT achieves 95.7% accuracy, outperforming recurrent, transformer, and graph-based baselines with significant improvements (d > 1.8, p < 0.001). Additionally, STGAT reduces detection delay by 26%, achieving a 2.3-time-step delay while maintaining stable performance under overflow, drift, and physical inconsistencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Connecting reflective asymmetries in multivariate spatial and spatio-temporal covariances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20132v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the analysis of multivariate spatial and univariate spatio-temporal data, it is commonly recognized that asymmetric dependence may exist, which can be addressed using an asymmetric (matrix or space-time, respectively) covariance function within a Gaussian process framework. This paper introduces a new paradigm for constructing asymmetric space-time covariances, which we refer to as "reflective asymmetric," by leveraging recently-introduced models for multivariate spatial data. We first provide new results for reflective asymmetric multivariate spatial models that extends their applicability. We then propose their asymmetric space-time extension, which come from a substantially different perspective than Lagrangian asymmetric space-time covariances. There are fewer parameters in the new models, one controls both the spatial and temporal marginal covariances, and the standard separable model is a special case. In simulation studies and analysis of the frequently-studied Irish wind data, these new models also improve model fit and prediction performance, and they can be easier to estimate. These features indicate broad applicability for improved analysis in environmental and other space-time data.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the PM2.5 -- Mortality Association: A Bayesian Model for Spatio-Temporal Confounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16106v3)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In epidemiological studies of air pollution and public health, estimating the health impact of exposure to air pollution may be hindered by the unknown functional form of the exposure-outcome association and by unmeasured confounding factors that are linked to both exposure and outcome. These challenges are especially relevant in spatio-temporal analyses, where their joint exploration remains limited. To study the effects of fine particulate matter on mortality among elderly people in Italy, we propose a Bayesian spatial dynamic generalized linear model that captures the non-linear exposure-outcome association and decomposes the exposure effect across fine and coarse spatio-temporal scales of variation. Together, these features allow reducing the spatio-temporal confounding bias and recovering the shape of the association, as demonstrated through simulation studies. The real-data analysis reveals a clear temporal pattern in the exposure effect, with peaks during summer months. We argue that this finding may be due to interactions of particulate matter with air temperature and unmeasured confounders.</p></details> | 45 pages, 9 figures |

These drawbacks lead to larger data distribution shift, making features less stable for MI-EEG tasks.To address these problems, we introduce STGMFM, a tri-branch framework tailored for dry-electrode MI-EEG, which models complementary spatio-temporal dependencies via dual graph orders, and captures robust envelope dynamics with a multi-scale frequency mixing branch, motivated by the observation that amplitude envelopes are less sensitive to contact variability than instantaneous waveforms. Physiologically meaningful connectivity priors guide learning, and decision-level fusion consolidates a noise-tolerant consensus. On our collected dry-electrode MI-EEG, STGMFM consistently surpasses competitive CNN/Transformer/graph baselines. Codes are available at https://github.com/Tianyi-325/STGMFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[NL4ST: A Natural Language Query Tool for Spatio-Temporal Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15758v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of mobile computing devices and positioning technologies has led to an explosive growth of spatio-temporal data managed in databases. Representative queries over such data include range queries, nearest neighbor queries, and join queries. However, formulating those queries usually requires domain-specific expertise and familiarity with executable query languages, which would be a challenging task for non-expert users. It leads to a great demand for well-supported natural language queries (NLQs) in spatio-temporal databases. To bridge the gap between non-experts and query plans in databases, we present NL4ST, an interactive tool that allows users to query spatio-temporal databases in natural language. NL4ST features a three-layer architecture: (i) knowledge base and corpus for knowledge preparation, (ii) natural language understanding for entity linking, and (iii) generating physical plans. Our demonstration will showcase how NL4ST provides effective spatio-temporal physical plans, verified by using four real and synthetic datasets. We make NL4ST online and provide the demo video at https://youtu.be/-J1R7R5WoqQ.</p></details> |  |
| **[UBATrack: Spatio-Temporal State Space Model for General Multi-Modal Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14799v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal object tracking has attracted considerable attention by integrating multiple complementary inputs (e.g., thermal, depth, and event data) to achieve outstanding performance. Although current general-purpose multi-modal trackers primarily unify various modal tracking tasks (i.e., RGB-Thermal infrared, RGB-Depth or RGB-Event tracking) through prompt learning, they still overlook the effective capture of spatio-temporal cues. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-modal tracking framework based on a mamba-style state space model, termed UBATrack. Our UBATrack comprises two simple yet effective modules: a Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) and a Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer. The former leverages Mamba's long-sequence modeling capability to jointly model cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal visual cues in an adapter-tuning manner. The latter further enhances multi-modal representation capacity across multiple feature dimensions to improve tracking robustness. In this way, UBATrack eliminates the need for costly full-parameter fine-tuning, thereby improving the training efficiency of multi-modal tracking algorithms. Experiments show that UBATrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks, achieving outstanding results on the LasHeR, RGBT234, RGBT210, DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD22, and VisEvent datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[FeedbackSTS-Det: Sparse Frames-Based Spatio-Temporal Semantic Feedback Network for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14690v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared small target detection (ISTD) under complex backgrounds remains a critical yet challenging task, primarily due to the extremely low signal-to-clutter ratio, persistent dynamic interference, and the lack of distinct target features. While multi-frame detection methods leverages temporal cues to improve upon single-frame approaches, existing methods still struggle with inefficient long-range dependency modeling and insufficient robustness. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel scheme for ISTD, realized through a sparse frames-based spatio-temporal semantic feedback network named FeedbackSTS-Det. The core of our approach is a novel spatio-temporal semantic feedback strategy with a closed-loop semantic association mechanism, which consists of paired forward and backward refinement modules that work cooperatively across the encoder and decoder. Moreover, both modules incorporate an embedded sparse semantic module (SSM), which performs structured sparse temporal modeling to capture long-range dependencies with low computational cost. This integrated design facilitates robust implicit inter-frame registration and continuous semantic refinement, effectively suppressing false alarms. Furthermore, our overall procedure maintains a consistent training-inference pipeline, which ensures reliable performance transfer and increases model robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of FeedbackSTS-Det.

However, most existing video customization methods rely on reference images or task-specific temporal priors, failing to fully exploit the rich spatio-temporal information inherent in videos, thereby limiting flexibility and generalization in video generation. To address these limitations, we propose OmniTransfer, a unified framework for spatio-temporal video transfer. It leverages multi-view information across frames to enhance appearance consistency and exploits temporal cues to enable fine-grained temporal control. To unify various video transfer tasks, OmniTransfer incorporates three key designs: Task-aware Positional Bias that adaptively leverages reference video information to improve temporal alignment or appearance consistency; Reference-decoupled Causal Learning separating reference and target branches to enable precise reference transfer while improving efficiency; and Task-adaptive Multimodal Alignment using multimodal semantic guidance to dynamically distinguish and tackle different tasks. Extensive experiments show that OmniTransfer outperforms existing methods in appearance (ID and style) and temporal transfer (camera movement and video effects), while matching pose-guided methods in motion transfer without using pose, establishing a new paradigm for flexible, high-fidelity video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github Page: https://pangzecheung.github.io/OmniTransfer/</p></details> |
| **[Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14115v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Liquid Time-Constant networks (LTCs), a type of continuous-time graph neural network, excel at modeling irregularly-sampled dynamics but are fundamentally confined to Euclidean space. This limitation introduces significant geometric distortion when representing real-world graphs with inherent non-Euclidean structures (e.g., hierarchies and cycles), degrading representation quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for RLSTG, extending stability theorems of LTCs to the Riemannian domain and quantifying its expressive power via state trajectory analysis. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that, by combining advanced temporal dynamics with a Riemannian spatial representation, RLSTG achieves superior performance on graphs with complex structures.

Existing evaluation metrics primarily focus on perceptual quality or reconstruction fidelity, and are not designed to assess whether a set of sampled frames adequately captures informative and representative video content. We propose Spatio-Temporal Entropy Coverage (STEC), a simple and non-reference metric for evaluating the effectiveness of video frame sampling. STEC builds upon Spatio-Temporal Frame Entropy (STFE), which measures per-frame spatial information via entropy-based structural complexity, and evaluates sampled frames based on their temporal coverage and redundancy. By jointly modeling spatial information strength, temporal dispersion, and non-redundancy, STEC provides a principled and lightweight measure of sampling quality. Experiments on the MSR-VTT test-1k benchmark demonstrate that STEC clearly differentiates common sampling strategies, including random, uniform, and content-aware methods. We further show that STEC reveals robustness patterns across individual videos that are not captured by average performance alone, highlighting its practical value as a general-purpose evaluation tool for efficient video understanding. We emphasize that STEC is not designed to predict downstream task accuracy, but to provide a task-agnostic diagnostic signal for analyzing frame sampling behavior under constrained budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper corresponds to the camera-ready version of a WACV 2026 Workshop paper</p></details> |

Point processes specified on linear networks can provide a more accurate description of crime incidents by considering the geometry of the city. We propose a spatio-temporal Dirichlet process mixture model on a linear network to analyze crime events in Valencia, Spain. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with a Dirichlet process prior to automatically detect space-time clusters of the events and adopt a convolution kernel estimator to account for the network structure in the city. From the fitted model, we provide crime hotspot visualizations that can inform social interventions to prevent crime incidents. Furthermore, we study the relationships between the detected cluster centers and the city's amenities, which provides an intuitive explanation of criminal contagion.</p></details> |  |

While advances in semantic scene representations have enriched robotic scene understanding, current approaches lack a connection between spatial features and dynamic events; e.g., connecting the blue mug to the event washing a mug. In this work, we introduce the event-grounding graph (EGG), a framework grounding event interactions to spatial features of a scene. This representation allows robots to perceive, reason, and respond to complex spatio-temporal queries. Experiments using real robotic data demonstrate EGG's capability to retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human inquiries concerning the environment and events within. Furthermore, the EGG framework's source code and evaluation dataset are released as open-source at: https://github.com/aalto-intelligent-robotics/EGG.</p></details> | Submitted to RA-L |
| **[A Graph Prompt Fine-Tuning Method for WSN Spatio-Temporal Correlation Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12745v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection of multi-temporal modal data in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can provide an important guarantee for reliable network operation. Existing anomaly detection methods in multi-temporal modal data scenarios have the problems of insufficient extraction of spatio-temporal correlation features, high cost of anomaly sample category annotation, and imbalance of anomaly samples. In this paper, a graph neural network anomaly detection backbone network incorporating spatio-temporal correlation features and a multi-task self-supervised training strategy of "pre-training - graph prompting - fine-tuning" are designed for the characteristics of WSN graph structure data. First, the anomaly detection backbone network is designed by improving the Mamba model based on a multi-scale strategy and inter-modal fusion method, and combining it with a variational graph convolution module, which is capable of fully extracting spatio-temporal correlation features in the multi-node, multi-temporal modal scenarios of WSNs. Secondly, we design a three-subtask learning "pre-training" method with no-negative comparative learning, prediction, and reconstruction to learn generic features of WSN data samples from unlabeled data, and design a "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning. The model is fine-tuned through the "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning model to complete the parameter fine-tuning, thereby reducing the training cost and enhancing the detection generalization performance. The F1 metrics obtained from experiments on the public dataset and the actual collected dataset are up to 91.30% and 92.31%, respectively, which provides better detection performance and generalization ability than existing methods designed by the method.</p></details> |  |
| **[CurConMix+: A Unified Spatio-Temporal Framework for Hierarchical Surgical Workflow Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12312v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical action triplet recognition aims to understand fine-grained surgical behaviors by modeling the interactions among instruments, actions, and anatomical targets. Despite its clinical importance for workflow analysis and skill assessment, progress has been hindered by severe class imbalance, subtle visual variations, and the semantic interdependence among triplet components. Existing approaches often address only a subset of these challenges rather than tackling them jointly, which limits their ability to form a holistic understanding. This study builds upon CurConMix, a spatial representation framework. At its core, a curriculum-guided contrastive learning strategy learns discriminative and progressively correlated features, further enhanced by structured hard-pair sampling and feature-level mixup. Its temporal extension, CurConMix+, integrates a Multi-Resolution Temporal Transformer (MRTT) that achieves robust, context-aware understanding by adaptively fusing multi-scale temporal features and dynamically balancing spatio-temporal cues. Furthermore, we introduce LLS48, a new, hierarchically annotated benchmark for complex laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy, providing step-, task-, and action-level annotations. Extensive experiments on CholecT45 and LLS48 demonstrate that CurConMix+ not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in triplet recognition, but also exhibits strong cross-level generalization, as its fine-grained features effectively transfer to higher-level phase and step recognition tasks. Together, the framework and dataset provide a unified foundation for hierarchy-aware, reproducible, and interpretable surgical workflow understanding. The code and dataset will be publicly released on GitHub to facilitate reproducibility and further research.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a topology-enhanced spatio-temporal feature fusion anomaly detection method, TE-MSTAD. First, building upon the RWKV model with linear attention mechanisms, a Cross-modal Feature Extraction (CFE) module is introduced to fully extract spatial correlation features among multiple nodes while reducing computational resource consumption. Second, a strategy is designed to construct an adjacency matrix by jointly learning spatial correlation from time-frequency domain features. Different graph neural networks are integrated to enhance spatial correlation feature extraction, thereby fully capturing spatial relationships among multiple nodes. Finally, a dual-branch network TE-MSTAD is designed for time-frequency domain feature fusion, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the time or frequency domain to improve WSN anomaly detection performance. Testing on both public and real-world datasets demonstrates that the TE-MSTAD model achieves F1 scores of 92.52% and 93.28%, respectively, exhibiting superior detection performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communication-Efficient Federated Learning by Exploiting Spatio-Temporal Correlations of Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10491v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Communication overhead is a critical challenge in federated learning, particularly in bandwidth-constrained networks. Although many methods have been proposed to reduce communication overhead, most focus solely on compressing individual gradients, overlooking the temporal correlations among them. Prior studies have shown that gradients exhibit spatial correlations, typically reflected in low-rank structures. Through empirical analysis, we further observe a strong temporal correlation between client gradients across adjacent rounds. Based on these observations, we propose GradESTC, a compression technique that exploits both spatial and temporal gradient correlations. GradESTC exploits spatial correlations to decompose each full gradient into a compact set of basis vectors and corresponding combination coefficients. By exploiting temporal correlations, only a small portion of the basis vectors need to be dynamically updated in each round. GradESTC significantly reduces communication overhead by transmitting lightweight combination coefficients and a limited number of updated basis vectors instead of the full gradients. Extensive experiments show that, upon reaching a target accuracy level near convergence, GradESTC reduces uplink communication by an average of 39.79% compared to the strongest baseline, while maintaining comparable convergence speed and final accuracy to uncompressed FedAvg. By effectively leveraging spatio-temporal gradient structures, GradESTC offers a practical and scalable solution for communication-efficient federated learning.</p></details> |  |

To better respond real-time user feedback, we have deployed an interactive recommender system (IRS) alongside our core homepage recommender system. This IRS is triggered by user click on homepage, and generates a series of highly relevant recommendations based on the clicked item to meet focused browsing demands. Different from traditional e-commerce RecSys, the full-screen UI and immersive swiping down functionality present two distinct challenges for regular ranking system. First, there exists explicit interference (overlap or conflicts) between ranking objectives, i.e., conversion, view and swipe down. This is because there are intrinsic behavioral co-occurrences under the premise of immersive browsing and swiping down functionality. Second, the ranking system is prone to temporal greedy traps in sequential recommendation slot transitions, which is caused by full-screen UI design. To alleviate these challenges, we propose a novel Spatio-temporal collaborative ranking (STCRank) framework to achieve collaboration between multi-objectives within one slot (spatial) and between multiple sequential recommondation slots. In multi-objective collaboration (MOC) module, we push Pareto frontier by mitigating the objective overlaps and conflicts. In multi-slot collaboration (MSC) module, we achieve global optima on overall sequential slots by dual-stage look-ahead ranking mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed method brings about purchase and DAU co-growth.

Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrackNetV5: Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement and Motion Direction Decoupling for Fast Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02789v4)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[U-MASK: User-adaptive Spatio-Temporal Masking for Personalized Mobile AI Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06867v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized mobile artificial intelligence applications are widely deployed, yet they are expected to infer user behavior from sparse and irregular histories under a continuously evolving spatio-temporal context. This setting induces a fundamental tension among three requirements, i.e., immediacy to adapt to recent behavior, stability to resist transient noise, and generalization to support long-horizon prediction and cold-start users. Most existing approaches satisfy at most two of these requirements, resulting in an inherent impossibility triangle in data-scarce, non-stationary personalization. To address this challenge, we model mobile behavior as a partially observed spatio-temporal tensor and unify short-term adaptation, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start recommendation as a conditional completion problem, where a user- and task-specific mask specifies which coordinates are treated as evidence. We propose U-MASK, a user-adaptive spatio-temporal masking method that allocates evidence budgets based on user reliability and task sensitivity. To enable mask generation under sparse observations, U-MASK learns a compact, task-agnostic user representation from app and location histories via U-SCOPE, which serves as the sole semantic conditioning signal. A shared diffusion transformer then performs mask-guided generative completion while preserving observed evidence, so personalization and task differentiation are governed entirely by the mask and the user representation. Experiments on real-world mobile datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across short-term prediction, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start settings, with the largest gains under severe data sparsity. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/NICE-HKU/U-MASK.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

Conventional 3D methods detect lanes from dense birds-eye-viewed (BEV) features, though erroneous transformations often result in a poor feature representation misaligned with the true 3D road surface. While recent sparse lane detectors have surpassed dense BEV approaches, they completely disregard valuable lane-specific priors. Furthermore, existing methods fail to utilize historic lane observations, which yield the potential to resolve ambiguities in situations of poor visibility. To address these challenges, we present SparseLaneSTP, a novel method that integrates both geometric properties of the lane structure and temporal information into a sparse lane transformer. It introduces a new lane-specific spatio-temporal attention mechanism, a continuous lane representation tailored for sparse architectures as well as temporal regularization. Identifying weaknesses of existing 3D lane datasets, we also introduce a precise and consistent 3D lane dataset using a simple yet effective auto-labeling strategy. Our experimental section proves the benefits of our contributions and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across all detection and error metrics on existing 3D lane detection benchmarks as well as on our novel dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025</p></details> |
| **[ASTGI: Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interactions for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23313v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework. Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points. Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel Graph Enhanced Spatio-temporal Hierarchical Inference Network (GEnSHIN) to handle the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic flow prediction. The model integrates three innovative designs: 1) An attention-enhanced Graph Convolutional Recurrent Unit (GCRU), which strengthens the modeling capability for long-term temporal dependencies by introducing Transformer modules; 2) An asymmetric dual-embedding graph generation mechanism, which leverages the real road network and data-driven latent asymmetric topology to generate graph structures that better fit the characteristics of actual traffic flow; 3) A dynamic memory bank module, which utilizes learnable traffic pattern prototypes to provide personalized traffic pattern representations for each sensor node, and introduces a lightweight graph updater during the decoding phase to adapt to dynamic changes in road network states. Extensive experiments on the public dataset METR-LA show that GEnSHIN achieves or surpasses the performance of comparative models across multiple metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Notably, the model demonstrates excellent prediction stability during peak morning and evening traffic hours. Ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of each core module and its contribution to the final performance.</p></details> |  |

This capability is vital for high-stakes decision-making in systems such as traffic networks, power grids, and disease propagation. However, the field remains underdeveloped because most existing works prioritize predictive accuracy over reasoning. To address the gap, we introduce ST-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four core tasks, including etiological reasoning, entity identification, correlation reasoning, and in-context forecasting, developed via a network SDE-based multi-agent data synthesis pipeline. We then propose STReasoner, which empowers LLM to integrate time series, graph structure, and text for explicit reasoning. To promote spatially grounded logic, we introduce S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that rewards performance gains specifically attributable to spatial information. Experiments show that STReasoner achieves average accuracy gains between 17% and 135% at only 0.004X the cost of proprietary models and generalizes robustly to real-world data.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, we release our code publicly at https://github.com/LingFengGold/STReasoner</p></details> |

We formalize these complexities into a new class of problems, dubbed Spatio-Temporal Efficacy-optimized Allocation for Multi-robot systems (STEAM). STEAM builds upon trait-based frameworks that model robots using their capabilities (e.g., payload and speed), but goes beyond the typical binary success-failure model by explicitly modeling the efficacy of allocations as trait-efficacy maps. These maps encode how the aggregated capabilities assigned to a task determine performance. Further, STEAM accommodates spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). To solve STEAM problems, we contribute a novel algorithm named Efficacy-optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (E-ITAGS) that simultaneously optimizes task performance and respects time budgets by interleaving task allocation, scheduling, and path planning. Motivated by the fact that trait-efficacy maps are difficult, if not impossible, to specify, E-ITAGS efficiently learns them using a realizability-aware active learning module. Our approach is realizability-aware since it explicitly accounts for the fact that not all combinations of traits are realizable by the robots available during learning. Further, we derive experimentally-validated bounds on E-ITAGS' suboptimality with respect to efficacy. Detailed numerical simulations and experiments using an emergency response domain demonstrate that E-ITAGS generates allocations of higher efficacy compared to baselines, while respecting resource and spatio-temporal constraints. We also show that our active learning approach is sample efficient and establishes a principled tradeoff between data and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>The j...</summary><p>The journal extension version of our conference paper: arXiv:2404.07902, which has been accepted by ISRR 2024</p></details> |

Traditional long-range forecasting, whether statistical or dynamical, has predominantly focused on predicting a single, spatially-averaged seasonal value, lacking the spatial detail essential for regional-level resource management. To address this gap, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that reframes gridded monsoon prediction as a spatio-temporal computer vision task. We treat multi-variable, pre-monsoon atmospheric and oceanic fields as a sequence of multi-channel images, effectively creating a video-like input tensor. Using 85 years of ERA5 reanalysis data for predictors and IMD rainfall data for targets, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture to learn the complex mapping from the five-month pre-monsoon period (January-May) to a high-resolution gridded rainfall pattern for the subsequent monsoon season. Our framework successfully produces distinct forecasts for each of the four monsoon months (June-September) as well as the total seasonal average, demonstrating its utility for both intra-seasonal and seasonal outlooks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 Tables, to be submitted to "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing"</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-temporal modeling and forecasting with Fourier neural operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01813v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal process models are often used for modeling dynamic physical and biological phenomena that evolve across space and time. These phenomena may exhibit environmental heterogeneity and complex interactions that are difficult to capture using traditional statistical process models such as Gaussian processes. This work proposes the use of Fourier neural operators (FNOs) for constructing statistical dynamical spatio-temporal models for forecasting. An FNO is a flexible mapping of functions that approximates the solution operator of possibly unknown linear or non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) in a computationally efficient manner. It does so using samples of inputs and their respective outputs, and hence explicit knowledge of the underlying PDE is not required. Through simulations from a nonlinear PDE with known solution, we compare FNO forecasts to those from state-of-the-art statistical spatio-temporal-forecasting methods. Further, using sea surface temperature data over the Atlantic Ocean and precipitation data across Europe, we demonstrate the ability of FNO-based dynamic spatio-temporal (DST) statistical modeling to capture complex real-world spatio-temporal dependencies. Using collections of testing instances, we show that the FNO-DST forecasts are accurate with valid uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Graph Deep Learning with Stochastic Differential Equations for Uncovering Alzheimer's Disease Progression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21735v3)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echo State Networks for Spatio-Temporal Area-Level Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10641v2)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal area-level datasets play a critical role in official statistics, providing valuable insights for policy-making and regional planning. Accurate modeling and forecasting of these datasets can be extremely useful for policymakers to develop informed strategies for future planning. Echo State Networks (ESNs) are efficient methods for capturing nonlinear temporal dynamics and generating forecasts. However, ESNs lack a direct mechanism to account for the neighborhood structure inherent in area-level data. Ignoring these spatial relationships can significantly compromise the accuracy and utility of forecasts. In this paper, we incorporate approximate graph spectral filters at the input stage of the ESN, thereby improving forecast accuracy while preserving the model's computational efficiency during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Eurostat's tourism occupancy dataset and show how it can support more informed decision-making in policy and planning contexts.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Damba-ST: Domain-Adaptive Mamba for Efficient Urban Spatio-Temporal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18939v3)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However, directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining or fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2026</p></details> |

Rather than relying on inefficient standard im2col-like implementations (e.g., spatial convolutions, depthwise convolutions and feature-shifting mechanisms) or hardware-specific CUDA kernels (e.g., deformable and neighborhood attention), which often suffer from limited portability across non-CUDA devices, we reorganize the local sampling process through a direction-based sampling perspective. Specifically, we implement a non-parametric sampling mechanism that enables dynamically varying sampling regions. This approach provides the flexibility to adapt to diverse spatial structures without the computational costs of parametric layers and the need for model retraining. To further enhance feature coherence across frames, we design a supervised spatio-temporal contrastive learning scheme that enforces consistency in feature representations. In addition, we introduce a publicly available benchmark dataset for multi-object segmentation in X-ray angiography videos (MOSXAV), featuring detailed, manually labeled segmentation ground truth. Extensive experiments on the CADICA, XACV, and MOSXAV datasets show that our proposed FSVOS method outperforms current state-of-the-art video segmentation methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and generalization capability (i.e., seen and unseen categories). This work offers enhanced flexibility and potential for a wide range of clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMBWatch -- a Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network approach to detect Illicit Massage Business](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00075v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Illicit Massage Businesses (IMBs) are a covert and persistent form of organized exploitation that operate under the facade of legitimate wellness services while facilitating human trafficking, sexual exploitation, and coerced labor. Detecting IMBs is difficult due to encoded digital advertisements, frequent changes in personnel and locations, and the reuse of shared infrastructure such as phone numbers and addresses. Traditional approaches, including community tips and regulatory inspections, are largely reactive and ineffective at revealing the broader operational networks traffickers rely on. To address these challenges, we introduce IMBWatch, a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) framework for large-scale IMB detection. IMBWatch constructs dynamic graphs from open-source intelligence, including scraped online advertisements, business license records, and crowdsourced reviews. Nodes represent heterogeneous entities such as businesses, aliases, phone numbers, and locations, while edges capture spatio-temporal and relational patterns, including co-location, repeated phone usage, and synchronized advertising. The framework combines graph convolutional operations with temporal attention mechanisms to model the evolution of IMB networks over time and space, capturing patterns such as intercity worker movement, burner phone rotation, and coordinated advertising surges. Experiments on real-world datasets from multiple U.S. cities show that IMBWatch outperforms baseline models, achieving higher accuracy and F1 scores. Beyond performance gains, IMBWatch offers improved interpretability, providing actionable insights to support proactive and targeted interventions. The framework is scalable, adaptable to other illicit domains, and released with anonymized data and open-source code to support reproducible research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI AISI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Spatio-Temporal Transport: From Rigid Advection to Realistic Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02756v4)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic models for spatio-temporal transport face a critical trade-off between physical realism and interpretability. The advection model with a single constant velocity is interpretable but physically limited by its perfect correlation over time. This work aims to bridge the gap between this simple framework and its physically realistic extensions. Our guiding principle is to introduce a spatial correlation structure that vanishes over time. To achieve this, we present two distinct approaches. The first constructs complex velocity structures, either through superpositions of advection components or by allowing the velocity to vary locally. The second is a spectral technique that replaces the singular spectrum of rigid advection with a more flexible form, introducing temporal decorrelation controlled by parameters. We accompany these models with efficient simulation algorithms and demonstrate their success in replicating complex dynamics, such as tropical cyclones and the solutions of partial differential equations. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of the proposed framework by comparing its simulations to real-world precipitation data from Hurricane Florence.</p></details> |  |

Although advanced Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain: (i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns; and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (AI for Social Impact)</p></details> |

Integrating data from satellite products and ground monitors are increasingly used to produce exposure surfaces. However, spatio-temporal misalignment often induced from missing data introduces substantial uncertainty and reduces predictive accuracy. We propose a Bayesian weighted predictor regression framework that models spatio-temporal relationships when predictors are observed on irregular supports or have substantial missing data, and are not concurrent with the outcome. The key feature of our model is a spatio-temporal kernel that aggregates the predictor over local space-time neighborhoods, built directly into the likelihood, eliminating any separate gap-filling or forced data alignment stage. We introduce a numerical approximation using a Voronoi-based spatial quadrature combined with irregular temporal increments for estimation under data missingness and misalignment. We showed that misspecification of the spatial and temporal lags induced bias in the mean and parameter estimates, indicating the need for principled parameter selection. Simulation studies confirmed these findings, where careful tuning was critical to control bias and achieve accurate prediction, while the proposed quadrature performed well under severe missingness. As an illustrative application, we estimated fine particulate matter (PM$_{2.5}$) in northern California using satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and wildfire smoke plume indicators. Relative to a traditional collocated linear model, our approach improved out-of-sample predictive performance, reduced uncertainty, and yielded robust temporal predictions and spatial surface estimation. Our framework is extensible to additional spatio-temporally varying covariates and other kernel families.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, Updated results section</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking the Spatio-Temporal Alignment of End-to-End 3D Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23635v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal alignment is crucial for temporal modeling of end-to-end (E2E) perception in autonomous driving (AD), providing valuable structural and textural prior information. Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%. When semantics are corrupted (nuScenes-C), the enhancement of motion modeling by HAT enables more robust perception and planning in the E2E AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

This study develops long-term forecasts of monthly rainfall across 19 districts of West Bengal using a century-scale dataset spanning 1900-2019. Daily rainfall records are aggregated into monthly series, resulting in 120 years of observations for each district. The forecasting task involves predicting the next 108 months (9 years, 2011-2019) while accounting for temporal dependencies and spatial interactions among districts. To address the nonlinear and complex structure of rainfall dynamics, we propose a hierarchical modeling framework that combines regression-based forecasting of yearly features with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for monthly prediction. Yearly features, such as annual totals, quarterly proportions, variability measures, skewness, and extremes, are first forecasted using regression models that incorporate both own lags and neighboring-district lags. These forecasts are then integrated as auxiliary inputs into an MLP model, which captures nonlinear temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in the monthly series. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical regression-MLP architecture provides robust long-term spatio-temporal forecasts, offering valuable insights for agriculture, irrigation planning, and water conservation strategies.</p></details> | 25 pages, 22 figures |

In this work, we incorporate improved spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to enhance state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos.

Although recent approaches model spatial and temporal correlations, they often under-exploit two practical characteristics of real deployments: the sparse spatial distribution of locations and the heterogeneous availability of auxiliary features across locations. To address these challenges, we propose AnchorGK, an Anchor-based Incremental and Stratified Graph Learning framework for inductive spatio-temporal kriging. AnchorGK introduces anchor locations to stratify the data in a principled manner. Anchors are constructed according to feature availability, and strata are then formed around these anchors. This stratification serves two complementary roles. First, it explicitly represents and continuously updates correlations between unobserved regions and surrounding observed locations within a graph learning framework. Second, it enables the systematic use of all available features across strata via an incremental representation mechanism, mitigating feature incompleteness without discarding informative signals. Building on the stratified structure, we design a dual-view graph learning layer that jointly aggregates feature-relevant and location-relevant information, learning stratum-specific representations that support accurate inference under inductive settings. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that AnchorGK consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for spatio-temporal kriging.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DynAttn, an interpretable dynamic-attention forecasting framework for high-dimensional spatio-temporal count processes. DynAttn combines rolling-window estimation, shared elastic-net feature gating, a compact weight-tied self-attention encoder, and a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) likelihood. This architecture produces calibrated multi-horizon forecasts of expected casualties and exceedance probabilities, while retaining transparent diagnostics through feature gates, ablation analysis, and elasticity measures. We evaluate DynAttn using global country-level and high-resolution PRIO-grid-level conflict data from the VIEWS forecasting system, benchmarking it against established statistical and machine-learning approaches, including DynENet, LSTM, Prophet, PatchTST, and the official VIEWS baseline. Across forecast horizons from one to twelve months, DynAttn consistently achieves substantially higher predictive accuracy, with particularly large gains in sparse grid-level settings where competing models often become unstable or degrade sharply. Beyond predictive performance, DynAttn enables structured interpretation of regional conflict dynamics. In our application, cross-regional analyses show that short-run conflict persistence and spatial diffusion form the core predictive backbone, while climate stress acts either as a conditional amplifier or a primary driver depending on the conflict theater.</p></details> |  |

Despite the advances in this field, the complex and stochastic nature of this task still poses challenges to existing approaches. Specifically, deterministic models tend to produce blurry predictions while generative models often struggle with poor accuracy. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective model architecture termed STLDM, a diffusion-based model that learns the latent representation from end to end alongside both the Variational Autoencoder and the conditioning network. STLDM decomposes this task into two stages: a deterministic forecasting stage handled by the conditioning network, and an enhancement stage performed by the latent diffusion model. Experimental results on multiple radar datasets demonstrate that STLDM achieves superior performance compared to the state of the art, while also improving inference efficiency.

We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.</p></details> |  |

Although many existing methods utilize multi-head attention mechanisms and message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture both spatial and temporal relations, these approaches encode temporal and spatial relations independently, and reflect the graph's topological characteristics in a limited manner. In this work, we introduce the Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer), a novel spatio-temporal GNN based on topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks based on MLPs: A temporal block for capturing temporal properties, a message-passing block for encapsulating spatial information, and a cycle message-passing block for enriching topological information through cyclic subgraphs. We bolster the effectiveness of Cy2Mixer with mathematical evidence emphasizing that our cycle message-passing block is capable of offering differentiated information to the deep learning model compared to the message-passing block. Furthermore, empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy of the Cy2Mixer, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances across various spatio-temporal benchmark datasets.

In contrast, many real-world systems including maritime traffic lack such fixed anchors, making the construction of spatio-temporal graphs a fundamental challenge. Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies.

| **[Deep Learning for Spatio-Temporal Fusion in Land Surface Temperature Estimation: A Comprehensive Survey, Experimental Analysis, and Future Trends](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16631v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Land Surface Temperature (LST) plays a key role in climate monitoring, urban heat assessment, and land-atmosphere interactions. However, current thermal infrared satellite sensors cannot simultaneously achieve high spatial and temporal resolution. Spatio-temporal fusion (STF) techniques address this limitation by combining complementary satellite data, one with high spatial but low temporal resolution, and another with high temporal but low spatial resolution. Existing STF techniques, from classical models to modern deep learning (DL) architectures, were primarily developed for surface reflectance (SR). Their application to thermal data remains limited and often overlooks LST-specific spatial and temporal variability. This study provides a focused review of DL-based STF methods for LST. We present a formal mathematical definition of the thermal fusion task, propose a refined taxonomy of relevant DL methods, and analyze the modifications required when adapting SR-oriented models to LST. To support reproducibility and benchmarking, we introduce a new dataset comprising 51 Terra MODIS-Landsat LST pairs from 2013 to 2024, and evaluate representative models to explore their behavior on thermal data. The analysis highlights performance gaps, architecture sensitivities, and open research challenges. The dataset and accompanying resources are publicly available at https://github.com/Sofianebouaziz1/STF-LST.</p></details> |  |
| **[DK-STN: A Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network Model for MJO Forecast](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19506v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is fundamental for precipitation forecasting and disaster prevention. To date, long-term and accurate MJO prediction has remained a challenge for researchers. Conventional MJO prediction methods using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and highly unstable (most NWP methods are sensitive to seasons, with better MJO forecast results in winter). While existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods save resources and speed forecasting, their accuracy never reaches the 28 days predicted by the state-of-the-art NWP method, i.e., the operational forecasts from ECMWF, since neural networks cannot handle climate data effectively. In this paper, we present a Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network (DK-STN), a stable neural network model for accurate and efficient MJO forecasting. It combines the benefits of NWP and ANN methods and successfully improves the forecast accuracy of ANN methods while maintaining a high level of efficiency and stability. We begin with a spatial-temporal network (STN) and embed domain knowledge in it using two key methods: (i) applying a domain knowledge enhancement method and (ii) integrating a domain knowledge processing method into network training. We evaluated DK-STN with the 5th generation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and compared it with ECMWF. Given 7 days of climate data as input, DK-STN can generate reliable forecasts for the following 28 days in 1-2 seconds, with an error of only 2-3 days in different seasons. DK-STN significantly exceeds ECMWF in that its forecast accuracy is equivalent to ECMWF's, while its efficiency and stability are significantly superior.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Automatic Neuronal Activity Segmentation in Fast Four Dimensional Spatio-Temporal Fluorescence Imaging using Bayesian Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19032v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluorescence Microcopy Calcium Imaging is a fundamental tool to in-vivo record and analyze large scale neuronal activities simultaneously at a single cell resolution. Automatic and precise detection of behaviorally relevant neuron activity from the recordings is critical to study the mapping of brain activity in organisms. However a perpetual bottleneck to this problem is the manual segmentation which is time and labor intensive and lacks generalizability. To this end, we present a Bayesian Deep Learning Framework to detect neuronal activities in 4D spatio-temporal data obtained by light sheet microscopy. Our approach accounts for the use of temporal information by calculating pixel wise correlation maps and combines it with spatial information given by the mean summary image. The Bayesian framework not only produces probability segmentation maps but also models the uncertainty pertaining to active neuron detection. To evaluate the accuracy of our framework we implemented the test of reproducibility to assert the generalization of the network to detect neuron activity. The network achieved a mean Dice Score of 0.81 relative to the synthetic Ground Truth obtained by Otsu's method and a mean Dice Score of 0.79 between the first and second run for test of reproducibility. Our method successfully deployed can be used for rapid detection of active neuronal activities for behavioural studies.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often overlook the multi-granularity nature of actions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Context-Aware Network (CAN). CAN consists of two core modules: the Multi-scale Temporal Cue Module (MTCM) and the Group Spatial Cue Module (GSCM). MTCM effectively extracts temporal cues at multiple scales, capturing both fast-changing motion details and overall action flow. GSCM, on the other hand, extracts spatial cues at different scales by grouping feature maps and applying specialized extraction methods to each group. Experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets (Something-Something V1 and V2, Diving48, Kinetics-400, and UCF101) demonstrate the effectiveness of CAN. Our approach achieves competitive performance, outperforming most mainstream methods, with accuracies of 50.4% on Something-Something V1, 63.9% on Something-Something V2, 88.4% on Diving48, 74.9% on Kinetics-400, and 86.9% on UCF101. These results highlight the importance of capturing multi-scale spatio-temporal cues for robust action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures.

A critical component of disease behavior is the velocity with which disease spreads, defined as the rate of change between time and space. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal modeling approach to determine the velocities of infectious disease spread. Our approach assumes that the locations and times of people infected can be considered as a spatio-temporal point pattern that arises as a realization of a spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox process. The intensity of this process is estimated using fast Bayesian inference by employing the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approaches. The velocity is then calculated using finite differences that approximate the derivatives of the intensity function. Finally, the directions and magnitudes of the velocities can be mapped at specific times to examine better the spread of the disease throughout the region. We demonstrate our method by analyzing COVID-19 spread in Cali, Colombia, during the 2020-2021 pandemic.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 46 figures, Journal American Statistican, submitted on 3rd of September</p></details> |
| **[A Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network for City-Scale Dynamic Logistics Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18441v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>City-scale logistics routing has become increasingly challenging as metropolitan road networks grow to tens of millions of edges and traffic conditions evolve rapidly under high-volume mobility demands. Conventional centralized routing algorithms and monolithic graph neural network (GNN) models suffer from limited scalability, high latency, and poor real-time adaptability, which restricts their effectiveness in large urban logistics systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network (HSTE-GNN) for dynamic routing over ultra-large road networks. The framework partitions the city-scale graph into regional subgraphs processed in parallel across distributed computing nodes, enabling efficient learning of localized traffic dynamics. Within each region, an edge-enhanced spatio-temporal module jointly models node states, dynamic edge attributes, and short-term temporal dependencies. A hierarchical coordination layer further aggregates cross-region representations through an asynchronous parameter-server mechanism, ensuring global routing coherence under high-frequency traffic updates. This distributed hierarchical design balances local responsiveness with global consistency, significantly improving scalability and inference efficiency. Experiments on real-world large-scale traffic datasets from Beijing and New York demonstrate that HSTE-GNN outperforms strong spatio-temporal baselines such as ST-GRAPH, achieving 34.9% lower routing delay, 14.7% lower MAPE, and 11.8% lower RMSE, while improving global route consistency by 7.3%. These results confirm that the proposed framework provides a scalable, adaptive, and efficient solution for next-generation intelligent transportation systems and large-scale logistics platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially-informed transformers: Injecting geostatistical covariance biases into self-attention for spatio-temporal forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17696v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The modeling of high-dimensional spatio-temporal processes presents a fundamental dichotomy between the probabilistic rigor of classical geostatistics and the flexible, high-capacity representations of deep learning. While Gaussian processes offer theoretical consistency and exact uncertainty quantification, their prohibitive computational scaling renders them impractical for massive sensor networks. Conversely, modern transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling but inherently lack a geometric inductive bias, treating spatial sensors as permutation-invariant tokens without a native understanding of distance. In this work, we propose a spatially-informed transformer, a hybrid architecture that injects a geostatistical inductive bias directly into the self-attention mechanism via a learnable covariance kernel. By formally decomposing the attention structure into a stationary physical prior and a non-stationary data-driven residual, we impose a soft topological constraint that favors spatially proximal interactions while retaining the capacity to model complex dynamics. We demonstrate the phenomenon of ``Deep Variography'', where the network successfully recovers the true spatial decay parameters of the underlying process end-to-end via backpropagation. Extensive experiments on synthetic Gaussian random fields and real-world traffic benchmarks confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks. Furthermore, rigorous statistical validation confirms that the proposed method delivers not only superior predictive accuracy but also well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts, effectively bridging the gap between physics-aware modeling and data-driven learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Spatio-Temporal Feature Representations for Video-Based Gaze Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17673v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based gaze estimation methods aim to capture the inherently temporal dynamics of human eye gaze from multiple image frames. However, since models must capture both spatial and temporal relationships, performance is limited by the feature representations within a frame but also between multiple frames. We propose the Spatio-Temporal Gaze Network (ST-Gaze), a model that combines a CNN backbone with dedicated channel attention and self-attention modules to fuse eye and face features optimally. The fused features are then treated as a spatial sequence, allowing for the capture of an intra-frame context, which is then propagated through time to model inter-frame dynamics. We evaluated our method on the EVE dataset and show that ST-Gaze achieves state-of-the-art performance both with and without person-specific adaptation. Additionally, our ablation study provides further insights into the model performance, showing that preserving and modelling intra-frame spatial context with our spatio-temporal recurrence is fundamentally superior to premature spatial pooling. As such, our results pave the way towards more robust video-based gaze estimation using commonly available cameras.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, the code repository is available at https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/u0172623/ST-Gaze</p></details> |
| **[Foundation for unbiased cross-validation of spatio-temporal models for species distribution modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03480v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the predictive performance of species distribution models (SDMs) under realistic deployment scenarios requires careful handling of spatial and temporal dependencies in the data. Cross-validation (CV) is the standard approach for model evaluation, but its design strongly influences the validity of performance estimates. When SDMs are intended for spatial or temporal transfer, random CV can lead to overoptimistic results due to spatial autocorrelation (SAC) among neighboring observations. We benchmark four machine learning algorithms (GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest) on two real-world presence-absence datasets, a temperate plant and an anadromous fish, using multiple CV designs: random, spatial, spatio-temporal, environmental, and forward-chaining. Two training data usage strategies (LAST FOLD and RETRAIN) are evaluated, with hyperparameter tuning performed within each CV scheme. Model performance is assessed on independent out-of-time test sets using AUC, MAE, and correlation metrics. Random CV overestimates AUC by up to 0.16 and produces MAE values up to 80 percent higher than spatially blocked alternatives. Blocking at the empirical SAC range substantially reduces this bias. Training strategy affects evaluation outcomes: LAST FOLD yields smaller validation-test discrepancies under strong SAC, while RETRAIN achieves higher test AUC when SAC is weaker. Boosted ensemble models consistently perform best under spatially structured CV designs. We recommend a robust SDM workflow based on SAC-aware blocking, blocked hyperparameter tuning, and external temporal validation to improve reliability under spatial and temporal shifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted manuscript.

| **[Pattern recognition in complex systems via vector-field representations of spatio-temporal data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16763v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A complex system comprises multiple interacting entities whose interdependencies form a unified whole, exhibiting emergent behaviours not present in individual components. Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |
| **[A Survey on Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16487v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many complex real-world systems exhibit inherently intertwined temporal and spatial characteristics. Spatio-temporal knowledge graphs (STKGs) have therefore emerged as a powerful representation paradigm, as they integrate entities, relationships, time and space within a unified graph structure. They are increasingly applied across diverse domains, including environmental systems and urban, transportation, social and human mobility networks. However, modeling STKGs remains challenging: their foundations span classical graph theory as well as temporal and spatial graph models, which have evolved independently across different research communities and follow heterogeneous modeling assumptions and terminologies. As a result, existing approaches often lack conceptual alignment, generalizability and reusability. This survey provides a systematic review of spatio-temporal knowledge graph models, tracing their origins in static, temporal and spatial graph modeling. We analyze existing approaches along key modeling dimensions, including edge semantics, temporal and spatial annotation strategies, temporal and spatial semantics and relate these choices to their respective application domains. Our analysis reveals that unified modeling frameworks are largely absent and that most current models are tailored to specific use cases rather than designed for reuse or long-term knowledge preservation. Based on these findings, we derive modeling guidelines and identify open challenges to guide future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[SNOW: Spatio-Temporal Scene Understanding with World Knowledge for Open-World Embodied Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16461v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robotic systems require spatio-temporal understanding of dynamic environments to ensure reliable navigation and interaction. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide open-world semantic priors, they lack grounding in 3D geometry and temporal dynamics. Conversely, geometric perception captures structure and motion but remains semantically sparse. We propose SNOW (Scene Understanding with Open-World Knowledge), a training-free and backbone-agnostic framework for unified 4D scene understanding that integrates VLM-derived semantics with point cloud geometry and temporal consistency. SNOW processes synchronized RGB images and 3D point clouds, using HDBSCAN clustering to generate object-level proposals that guide SAM2-based segmentation. Each segmented region is encoded through our proposed Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP), producing multimodal tokens that capture localized semantic, geometric, and temporal attributes. These tokens are incrementally integrated into a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG), which serves as 4D prior for downstream reasoning. A lightweight SLAM backend anchors all STEP tokens spatially in the environment, providing the global reference alignment, and ensuring unambiguous spatial grounding across time. The resulting 4DSG forms a queryable, unified world model through which VLMs can directly interpret spatial scene structure and temporal dynamics. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that SNOW enables precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, thereby setting new state-of-the-art performance in several settings, highlighting the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Machine Learning Model for Mortgage Credit Risk: Default Probabilities and Loan Portfolios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02846v3)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel machine learning model for credit risk by combining tree-boosting with a latent spatio-temporal Gaussian process model accounting for frailty correlation. This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[R4: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning for Vision-Language Models in 4D Spatio-Temporal Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15940v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans perceive and reason about their surroundings in four dimensions by building persistent, structured internal representations that encode semantic meaning, spatial layout, and temporal dynamics. These multimodal memories enable them to recall past events, infer unobserved states, and integrate new information into context-dependent reasoning. Inspired by this capability, we introduce R4, a training-free framework for retrieval-augmented reasoning in 4D spatio-temporal space that equips vision-language models (VLMs) with structured, lifelong memory. R4 continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time, yielding a persistent world model that can be shared across agents. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations, which are integrated into the VLM's reasoning. Unlike classical retrieval-augmented generation methods, retrieval in R4 operates directly in 4D space, enabling episodic and collaborative reasoning without training. Experiments on embodied question answering and navigation benchmarks demonstrate that R4 substantially improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines, advancing a new paradigm for embodied 4D reasoning in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a new concept of 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP), which aims to address two tasks: (1) reactive forecasting: ''what will happen next'' and (2) proactive forecasting: "what would happen given a specific future action". For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames). To address this task, we propose OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model that maintains a dense voxel-based scene state and incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context over time. OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation. This design enables online inference and robust performance even when historical sensor input is missing or noisy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the OccSTeP concept and our OccSTeP-WM, yielding an average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain).

| **[Rigid-Deformation Decomposition AI Framework for 3D Spatio-Temporal Prediction of Vehicle Collision Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19712v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a rigid-deformation decomposition framework for vehicle collision dynamics that mitigates the spectral bias of implicit neural representations, that is, coordinate-based neural networks that directly map spatio-temporal coordinates to physical fields. We introduce a hierarchical architecture that decouples global rigid-body motion from local deformation using two scale-specific networks, denoted as RigidNet and DeformationNet. To enforce kinematic separation between the two components, we adopt a frozen-anchor training strategy combined with a quaternion-incremental scheme. This strategy alleviates the kinematic instability observed in joint training and yields a 29.8% reduction in rigid-body motion error compared with conventional direct prediction schemes. The stable rigid-body anchor improves the resolution of high-frequency structural buckling, which leads to a 17.2% reduction in the total interpolation error. Loss landscape analysis indicates that the decomposition smooths the optimization surface, which enhances robustness to distribution shifts in angular extrapolation and yields a 46.6% reduction in error. To assess physical validity beyond numerical accuracy, we benchmark the decomposed components against an oracle model that represents an upper bound on performance. The proposed framework recovers 92% of the directional correlation between rigid and deformation components and 96% of the spatial deformation localization accuracy relative to the oracle, while tracking the temporal energy dynamics with an 8 ms delay. These results demonstrate that rigid-deformation decomposition enables accurate and physically interpretable predictions for nonlinear collision dynamics.</p></details> | 38 pages, 24 figures |

Despite their potential, research on spatio-temporal knowledge graph question answering (STKGQA) remains limited. This is primarily due to the lack of datasets that simultaneously contain spatio-temporal information, as well as methods capable of handling implicit spatio-temporal reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce the spatio-temporal question answering dataset (STQAD), the first comprehensive benchmark comprising 10,000 natural language questions that require both temporal and spatial reasoning. STQAD is constructed with real-world facts containing spatio-temporal information, ensuring that the dataset reflects practical scenarios. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that existing KGQA methods underperform on STQAD, primarily due to their inability to model spatio-temporal interactions. To address this, we propose the spatio-temporal complex question answering (STCQA) method, which jointly embeds temporal and spatial features into KG representations and dynamically filters answers through constraint-aware reasoning. STCQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Our work not only provides a valuable resource for future research but also advances the field by offering a robust baseline for answering complex spatio-temporal questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 10 figures.

| **[NL2SpaTiaL: Generating Geometric Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications from Natural Language for Manipulation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13670v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Logic (SpaTiaL) offers a principled formalism for expressing geometric spatial requirements-an essential component of robotic manipulation, where object locations, neighborhood relations, pose constraints, and interactions directly determine task success. Yet prior works have largely relied on standard temporal logic (TL), which models only robot trajectories and overlooks object-level interactions. Existing datasets built from randomly generated TL formulas paired with natural-language descriptions therefore cover temporal operators but fail to represent the layered spatial relations that manipulation tasks depend on. To address this gap, we introduce a dataset generation framework that synthesizes SpaTiaL specifications and converts them into natural-language descriptions through a deterministic, semantics-preserving back-translation procedure. This pipeline produces the NL2SpaTiaL dataset, aligning natural language with multi-level spatial relations and temporal objectives to reflect the compositional structure of manipulation tasks. Building on this foundation, we propose a translation-verification framework equipped with a language-based semantic checker that ensures the generated SpaTiaL formulas faithfully encode the semantics specified by the input description. Experiments across a suite of manipulation tasks show that SpaTiaL-based representations yield more interpretable, verifiable, and compositional grounding for instruction following.

Existing 2D speech-to-video diffusion models depend heavily on reference guidance, leading to limited motion diversity. At the same time, 3D-aware animation typically relies on inversion through pre-trained tri-plane generators, which often leads to imperfect reconstructions and identity drift. We rethink reference- and geometry-based paradigms in two ways. First, we deviate from strict reference conditioning at pre-training by introducing softer identity constraints. Second, we address 3D awareness implicitly within the 2D video domain by leveraging the inherent multi-view nature of video data. STARCaster adopts a compositional approach progressing from ID-aware motion modeling, to audio-visual synchronization via lip reading-based supervision, and finally to novel view animation through temporal-to-spatial adaptation. To overcome the scarcity of 4D audio-visual data, we propose a decoupled learning approach in which view consistency and temporal coherence are trained independently. A self-forcing training scheme enables the model to learn from longer temporal contexts than those generated at inference, mitigating the overly static animations common in existing autoregressive approaches. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STARCaster generalizes effectively across tasks and identities, consistently surpassing prior approaches in different benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://foivospar.github.io/STARCaster/</p></details> |

While forecasting models generally disregard unmonitored roads by design, spatial imputation methods explicitly address network-wide estimation; yet this approach relies on volume data at inference time, limiting its applicability in sensor-scarce cities. Unlike traffic volume data, probe vehicle speeds and static road attributes are more broadly accessible and support full coverage of road segments in most urban networks. In this work, we present the Hybrid Directed-Attention Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HDA-STGNN), an inductive deep learning framework designed to tackle the network-wide volume estimation problem. Our approach leverages speed profiles, static road attributes, and road network topology to predict daily traffic volume profiles across all road segments in the network. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform extensive ablation studies that demonstrate the model's capacity to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies and highlight the value of topological information for accurate network-wide traffic volume estimation without relying on volume data at inference time.</p></details> |  |

Our algorithm consists of two branches: spatial processing and time evolution. Regarding the spatial processing, the classical module encodes the local topological features of the road network based on the GCN method, and the quantum module is designed to map graph features onto parameterized quantum circuits through a differentiable pooling layer. The time evolution is solved by integrating multi-source contextual information and capturing dynamic trip dependencies on the classical TCN theory. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the current methods in terms of prediction accuracy and stability, validating the unique advantages of the quantum-enhanced mechanism in capturing high-dimensional spatial dependencies.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods rely solely on the previous frame's features to predict temporal context, leading to two critical issues. First, the short reference window misses long-term dependencies and fine texture details. Second, propagating only feature-level information accumulates errors over frames, causing prediction inaccuracies and loss of subtle textures. To address these, we propose the Long-term Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Context (L-STEC) method. We first extend the reference chain with LSTM to capture long-term dependencies. We then incorporate warped spatial context from the pixel domain, fusing spatio-temporal information through a multi-receptive field network to better preserve reference details. Experimental results show that L-STEC significantly improves compression by enriching contextual information, achieving 37.01% bitrate savings in PSNR and 31.65% in MS-SSIM compared to DCVC-TCM, outperforming both VTM-17.0 and DCVC-FM and establishing new state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Data Compression Conference (DCC) 2026 as an oral paper</p></details> |

Adaptive delayed matching creates a trade-off between matching and pickup delays by deciding whether to assign drivers immediately or batch requests. Since outcomes accumulate over long horizons with stochastic dynamics, reinforcement learning (RL) is a suitable framework. However, existing approaches often oversimplify traffic dynamics or use shallow encoders that miss complex spatiotemporal patterns. We introduce the Regime-Aware Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (RAST-MoE), which formalizes adaptive delayed matching as a regime-aware MDP equipped with a self-attention MoE encoder. Unlike monolithic networks, our experts specialize automatically, improving representation capacity while maintaining computational efficiency. A physics-informed congestion surrogate preserves realistic density-speed feedback, enabling millions of efficient rollouts, while an adaptive reward scheme guards against pathological strategies. With only 12M parameters, our framework outperforms strong baselines. On real-world Uber trajectory data (San Francisco), it improves total reward by over 13%, reducing average matching and pickup delays by 10% and 15% respectively. It demonstrates robustness across unseen demand regimes and stable training. These findings highlight the potential of MoE-enhanced RL for large-scale decision-making with complex spatiotemporal dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a weakly-supervised generative network for daily 10 m LST estimation via spatio-temporal fusion of Terra MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity, normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.05% and improves SSIM by 4.22%. Furthermore, WGAST effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against near-surface air temperature measurements from 33 near-ground sensors. The code is available at https://github.com/Sofianebouaziz1/WGAST.git.</p></details> |  |

Modified training objectives can improve calibration, but retraining is expensive. Inference-time steering offers a lightweight alternative, yet most existing methods optimize proxies for correctness rather than correctness itself. We introduce CORAL (Correctness-Optimized Residual Activation Lens), a regularized inference-time steering method that captures distributed correctness signals from model internal activations using weight-decay MLP probes. We evaluate CORAL across three 7B-parameter models and find that it consistently improves accuracy by 10\% and expected calibration error (ECE) by 50\% on average. We additionally demonstrate that these gains transfer without retraining to the complete published test sets of four held-out benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, Math-MC, OpenBookQA), averaging 14\% accuracy improvements and 49\% ECE improvements. Our results support the hypothesis that distributed information in model internals can be extracted using regularized probes when individual neurons are insufficient. CORAL thus provides a compute-efficient, transferable, and calibration-aware approach to improve MCQA performance during inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Data-Driven Algorithm for Real-Time Friction Force Estimation in Hydraulic Cylinders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05967v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hydraulic systems are widely utilized in industrial applications due to their high force generation, precise control, and ability to function in harsh environments. Hydraulic cylinders, as actuators in these systems, apply force and position through the displacement of hydraulic fluid, but their operation is significantly influenced by friction force. Achieving precision in hydraulic cylinders requires an accurate friction model under various operating conditions. Existing analytical models, often derived from experimental tests, necessitate the identification or estimation of influencing factors but are limited in adaptability and computational efficiency. This research introduces a data-driven, hybrid algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forests for nonlinear friction force estimation. The algorithm effectively combines feature detection and estimation processes using training data acquired from an experimental hydraulic test setup. It achieves a consistent and stable model error of less than 10% across diverse operating conditions and external load variations, ensuring robust performance in complex situations. The computational cost of the algorithm is 1.51 milliseconds per estimation, making it suitable for real-time applications. The proposed method addresses the limitations of analytical models by delivering high precision and computational efficiency. The algorithm's performance is validated through detailed analysis and experimental results, including direct comparisons with the LuGre model. The comparison highlights that while the LuGre model offers a theoretical foundation for friction modeling, its performance is limited by its inability to dynamically adjust to varying operational conditions of the hydraulic cylinder, further emphasizing the advantages of the proposed hybrid approach in real-time applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: 2025 33rd International Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE), Publisher IEEE</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Discover at Test Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16175v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we use AI to discover a new state of the art for a scientific problem? Prior work in test-time scaling, such as AlphaEvolve, performs search by prompting a frozen LLM. We perform reinforcement learning at test time, so the LLM can continue to train, but now with experience specific to the test problem. This form of continual learning is quite special, because its goal is to produce one great solution rather than many good ones on average, and to solve this very problem rather than generalize to other problems. Therefore, our learning objective and search subroutine are designed to prioritize the most promising solutions. We call this method Test-Time Training to Discover (TTT-Discover). Following prior work, we focus on problems with continuous rewards. We report results for every problem we attempted, across mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, algorithm design, and biology. TTT-Discover sets the new state of the art in almost all of them: (i) Erdős' minimum overlap problem and an autocorrelation inequality; (ii) a GPUMode kernel competition (up to $2\times$ faster than prior art); (iii) past AtCoder algorithm competitions; and (iv) denoising problem in single-cell analysis. Our solutions are reviewed by experts or the organizers. All our results are achieved with an open model, OpenAI gpt-oss-120b, and can be reproduced with our publicly available code, in contrast to previous best results that required closed frontier models. Our test-time training runs are performed using Tinker, an API by Thinking Machines, with a cost of only a few hundred dollars per problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/test-time-training/discover</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Global-Instance Prompt Tuning for Continual Test-time Adaptation in Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05937v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distribution shift is a common challenge in medical images obtained from different clinical centers, significantly hindering the deployment of pre-trained semantic segmentation models in real-world applications across multiple domains. Continual Test-Time Adaptation(CTTA) has emerged as a promising approach to address cross-domain shifts during continually evolving target domains. Most existing CTTA methods rely on incrementally updating model parameters, which inevitably suffer from error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting, especially in long-term adaptation. Recent prompt-tuning-based works have shown potential to mitigate the two issues above by updating only visual prompts. While these approaches have demonstrated promising performance, several limitations remain:1)lacking multi-scale prompt diversity, 2)inadequate incorporation of instance-specific knowledge, and 3)risk of privacy leakage. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale Global-Instance Prompt Tuning(MGIPT), to enhance scale diversity of prompts and capture both global- and instance-level knowledge for robust CTTA. Specifically, MGIPT consists of an Adaptive-scale Instance Prompt(AIP) and a Multi-scale Global-level Prompt(MGP). AIP dynamically learns lightweight and instance-specific prompts to mitigate error accumulation with adaptive optimal-scale selection mechanism. MGP captures domain-level knowledge across different scales to ensure robust adaptation with anti-forgetting capabilities. These complementary components are combined through a weighted ensemble approach, enabling effective dual-level adaptation that integrates both global and local information. Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our MGIPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving robust adaptation across continually changing target domains.</p></details> | 8 pages, BIBM2025 |
| **[Quantum Circuit Generation via test-time learning with large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03466v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can generate structured artifacts, but using them as dependable optimizers for scientific design requires a mechanism for iterative improvement under black-box evaluation. Here, we cast quantum circuit synthesis as a closed-loop, test-time optimization problem: an LLM proposes edits to a fixed-length gate list, and an external simulator evaluates the resulting state with the Meyer-Wallach (MW) global entanglement measure. We introduce a lightweight test-time learning recipe that can reuse prior high-performing candidates as an explicit memory trace, augments prompts with a score-difference feedback, and applies restart-from-the-best sampling to escape potential plateaus. Across fixed 20-qubit settings, the loop without feedback and restart-from-the-best improves random initial circuits over a range of gate budgets. To lift up this performance and success rate, we use the full learning strategy. For the 25-qubit, it mitigates a pronounced performance plateau when naive querying is used. Beyond raw scores, we analyze the structure of synthesized states and find that high MW solutions can correspond to stabilizer or graph-state-like constructions, but full connectivity is not guaranteed due to the metric property and prompt design. These results illustrate both the promise and the pitfalls of memory evaluator-guided LLM optimization for circuit synthesis, highlighting the critical role of prior human-made theoretical theorems to optimally design a custom tool in support of research.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Pathwise Test-Time Correction for Autoregressive Long Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05871v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distilled autoregressive diffusion models facilitate real-time short video synthesis but suffer from severe error accumulation during long-sequence generation. While existing Test-Time Optimization (TTO) methods prove effective for images or short clips, we identify that they fail to mitigate drift in extended sequences due to unstable reward landscapes and the hypersensitivity of distilled parameters. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Test-Time Correction (TTC), a training-free alternative. Specifically, TTC utilizes the initial frame as a stable reference anchor to calibrate intermediate stochastic states along the sampling trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method seamlessly integrates with various distilled models, extending generation lengths with negligible overhead while matching the quality of resource-intensive training-based methods on 30-second benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances, existing approaches still face limitations in both reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose a method that utilizes a phase-aware signal prior which exploits estimates of the instantaneous frequency. An optimization problem is formulated and solved using the generalized Chambolle-Pock algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated against other time-frequency inpainting methods, specifically a deep-prior audio inpainting neural network and the autoregression-based approach known as Janssen-TF. Our proposed approach surpassed these methods by a large margin in the objective evaluation as well as in the conducted subjective listening test, improving the state of the art. In addition, the reconstructions are obtained with a substantially reduced computational cost compared to alternative methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE for review</p></details> |
| **[Non-Stationary Inventory Control with Lead Times](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05799v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study non-stationary single-item, periodic-review inventory control problems in which the demand distribution is unknown and may change over time. We analyze how demand non-stationarity affects learning performance across inventory models, including systems with demand backlogging or lost-sales, both with and without lead times. For each setting, we propose an adaptive online algorithm that optimizes over the class of base-stock policies and establish performance guarantees in terms of dynamic regret relative to the optimal base-stock policy at each time step. Our results reveal a sharp separation across inventory models. In backlogging systems and lost-sales models with zero lead time, we show that it is possible to adapt to demand changes without incurring additional performance loss in stationary environments, even without prior knowledge of the demand distributions or the number of demand shifts. In contrast, for lost-sales systems with positive lead times, we establish weaker guarantees that reflect fundamental limitations imposed by delayed replenishment in combination with censored feedback. Our algorithms leverage the convexity and one-sided feedback structure of inventory costs to enable counterfactual policy evaluation despite demand censoring. We complement the theoretical analysis with simulation results showing that our methods significantly outperform existing benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Policy Gradient-Based Sequence-to-Sequence Method for Time Series Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09643v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequence-to-sequence architectures built upon recurrent neural networks have become a standard choice for multi-step-ahead time series prediction. In these models, the decoder produces future values conditioned on contextual inputs, typically either actual historical observations (ground truth) or previously generated predictions. During training, feeding ground-truth values helps stabilize learning but creates a mismatch between training and inference conditions, known as exposure bias, since such true values are inaccessible during real-world deployment. On the other hand, using the model's own outputs as inputs at test time often causes errors to compound rapidly across prediction steps. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce a new training paradigm grounded in reinforcement learning: a policy gradient-based method to learn an adaptive input selection strategy for sequence-to-sequence prediction models. Auxiliary models first synthesize plausible input candidates for the decoder, and a trainable policy network optimized via policy gradients dynamically chooses the most beneficial inputs to maximize long-term prediction performance. Empirical evaluations on diverse time series datasets confirm that our approach enhances both accuracy and stability in multi-step forecasting compared to conventional methods.</p></details> |  |

Timely scheduling opportunities are characterized by the peak age of information (PAoI)-metric and are incorporated into a network-side optimization problem as constraints modeling user satisfaction. The problem being NP-hard, we resort to a signaling-free, weighted proportional fair-based iterative heuristic algorithm, where the weights are derived with respect to the PAoI metric. Extensive numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of XR capacity without sacrificing the overall system throughput.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, single column, 4 figures.

| **[Empowering Time Series Analysis with Large-Scale Multimodal Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05646v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While existing time series foundation models primarily rely on large-scale unimodal pretraining, they lack complementary modalities to enhance time series understanding. Building multimodal foundation models is a natural next step, but it faces key challenges: 1) lack of a unified multimodal pretraining paradigm and large-scale multimodal corpora for time series analysis; 2) how to effectively integrate heterogeneous modalities and enhance model generalization. To address these challenges, we take an early step toward multimodal foundation models for time series analysis. We first propose a multimodal pretraining paradigm that leverages time series with endogenous modalities (derived images and text) and exogenous knowledge (real-world news), providing a comprehensive multi-view perspective for time series analysis. To support this, we develop an automated data construction pipeline to curate MM-TS, the first large-scale multimodal time series dataset spanning six domains, with up to one billion points. Then we propose HORAI, a frequency-enhanced multimodal foundation model. It integrates two core components: the Frequency-enhanced Cross-Modality Encoder and the Time-Frequency Decoder, designed to effectively fuse multimodal features and enhance model generalization across modalities and domains. After pretraining on MM-TS, HORAI achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating strong generalization.</p></details> |  |

As these technologies move into routine use, they demand cryptographic primitives that maintain strong security and deliver predictable performance through clear theoretical models of time complexity. Although NIST's lightweight cryptography project provides empirical evaluations of the ten finalist algorithms, a unified theoretical understanding of their time-complexity behavior remains absent. This work introduces a symbolic model that decomposes each scheme into initialization, data-processing, and finalization phases, enabling formal time-complexity derivation for all ten finalists. The results clarify how design parameters shape computational scaling on constrained mobile and embedded environments. The framework provides a foundation needed to distinguish algorithmic efficiency and guides the choice of primitives capable of supporting security systems in constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at the IEEE 16th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (IEEE CCWC 2026)</p></details> |

We present an implementation-aware analysis and tuning workflow for saturated discrete-time joint control. We (i) derive PI stability regions under Euler and exact zero-order-hold (ZOH) discretizations using the Jury criterion, (ii) evaluate a discrete back-calculation anti-windup realization under saturation-dominant regimes, and (iii) propose a hybrid-certified Bayesian optimization workflow that screens analytically unstable candidates and behaviorally unsafe transients while optimizing a robust IAE objective with soft penalties on overshoot and saturation duty. Baseline sweeps ($τ=1.0$~s, $Δt=0.01$~s, $u\in[-10,10]$) quantify rise/settle trends for P/PI/PID. Under a randomized model family emulating uncertainty, delay, noise, quantization, and tighter saturation, robustness-oriented tuning improves median IAE from $0.843$ to $0.430$ while keeping median overshoot below $2\%$. In simulation-only tuning, the certification screen rejects $11.6\%$ of randomly sampled gains within bounds before full robust evaluation, improving sample efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pendi...</summary><p>Pending IEEE Transactions on Robotics Publication</p></details> |
| **[Uncovering Residual Factors in Financial Time Series via PCA and MTP2-constrained Gaussian Graphical Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05580v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial time series are commonly decomposed into market factors, which capture shared price movements across assets, and residual factors, which reflect asset-specific deviations. To hedge the market-wide risks, such as the COVID-19 shock, trading strategies that exploit residual factors have been shown to be effective. However, financial time series often exhibit near-singular eigenstructures, which hinder the stable and accurate estimation of residual factors. This paper proposes a method for extracting residual factors from financial time series that hierarchically applies principal component analysis (PCA) and Gaussian graphical model (GGM). Our hierarchical approach balances stable estimation with elimination of factors that PCA alone cannot fully remove, enabling efficient extraction of residual factors. We use multivariate totally positive of order 2 (MTP2)-constrained GGM to capture the predominance of positive correlations in financial data. Our analysis proves that the resulting residual factors exhibit stronger orthogonality than those obtained with PCA alone. Across multiple experiments with varying test periods and training set lengths, the proposed method consistently achieved superior orthogonality of the residual factors. Backtests on the S&P 500 and TOPIX 500 constituents further indicate improved trading performance, including higher Sharpe ratios.</p></details> |  |

One prominent threat in this context is backdoor attacks, in which adversaries embed hidden behaviors in language models that activate under specific conditions. Previous work has assumed that adversaries have access to training pipelines or deployment infrastructure. We propose a novel attack surface requiring neither, which utilizes the chat template. Chat templates are executable Jinja2 programs invoked at every inference call, occupying a privileged position between user input and model processing. We show that an adversary who distributes a model with a maliciously modified template can implant an inference-time backdoor without modifying model weights, poisoning training data, or controlling runtime infrastructure. We evaluated this attack vector by constructing template backdoors targeting two objectives: degrading factual accuracy and inducing emission of attacker-controlled URLs, and applied them across eighteen models spanning seven families and four inference engines. Under triggered conditions, factual accuracy drops from 90% to 15% on average while attacker-controlled URLs are emitted with success rates exceeding 80%; benign inputs show no measurable degradation. Backdoors generalize across inference runtimes and evade all automated security scans applied by the largest open-weight distribution platform. These results establish chat templates as a reliable and currently undefended attack surface in the LLM supply chain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-time Adaptive Hierarchical Co-enhanced Denoising Network for Reliable Multimodal Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07163v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable learning of multimodal data (e.g., multi-omics) is a widely concerning issue, especially in safety-critical applications such as medical diagnosis. However, low-quality data induced by multimodal noise poses a major challenge in this domain, causing existing methods to suffer from two key limitations. First, they struggle to handle heterogeneous data noise, hindering robust multimodal representation learning. Second, they exhibit limited adaptability and generalization when encountering previously unseen noise. To address these issues, we propose Test-time Adaptive Hierarchical Co-enhanced Denoising Network (TAHCD). On one hand, TAHCD introduces the Adaptive Stable Subspace Alignment and Sample-Adaptive Confidence Alignment to reliably remove heterogeneous noise. They account for noise at both global and instance levels and enable jointly removal of modality-specific and cross-modality noise, achieving robust learning. On the other hand, TAHCD introduces Test-Time Cooperative Enhancement, which adaptively updates the model in response to input noise in a label-free manner, thus improving generalization. This is achieved by collaboratively enhancing the joint removal process of modality-specific and cross-modality noise across global and instance levels according to sample noise. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance, robustness, and generalization compared with state-of-the-art reliable multimodal learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages,9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

We propose a synthetic anomaly generation method named Generator for Instantiating Anomalies in Time Series (GenIAS), which generates realistic and diverse anomalies via a novel learnable perturbation in the latent space of a variational autoencoder. This enables abnormal patterns to be injected across different temporal segments at varying scales based on variational reparameterization. To generate anomalies that align with normal patterns while remaining distinguishable, we introduce a learning strategy that jointly learns the perturbation scale and compact latent representations via a tunable prior, which improves the distinguishability of generated anomalies, as supported by our theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments show that GenIAS produces more diverse and realistic anomalies, and that detection models trained with these anomalies outperform 17 baseline methods on 9 popular TSAD benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Time Series Forecasting with Robust Reconciliation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20383v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice, however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case average of weighted squared residuals over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods often rely on centralized fine-tuning or static preference alignment within a single model, they struggle to achieve both real-time and high-quality personalization under the resource and privacy constraints of personal devices. To address this challenge, we propose CoSteer, a collaborative framework that enables tuning-free, real-time personalization via decoding-time adaptation. By leveraging logit differences between context-aware and context-agnostic local small models, CoSteer steers cloud-based large models, ensuring effective personalization while preserving the large model's capabilities. Personalization is handled locally, with only final tokens sent to the cloud, maintaining both user context and system efficiency. Through extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks, we demonstrate that CoSteer generates high-quality personalized content, ensuring both effectiveness and computational efficiency. Our results highlight its robustness across models and environments, confirming its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This paper empirically evaluates foundation models capable of modeling cross-channel correlations against a baseline LSTM with reversible instance normalization across Singaporean and Australian electricity markets at hourly and daily granularities. We systematically assess MOIRAI, MOMENT, TinyTimeMixers, ChronosX, and Chronos-2 under three feature configurations: all features, selected features, and target-only. Our findings reveal highly variable effectiveness: while Chronos-2 achieves the best performance among foundation models (in zero-shot settings), the simple baseline frequently outperforms all foundation models in Singapore's stable climate, particularly for short-term horizons. Model architecture proves critical, with synergistic architectural implementations (TTM's channel-mixing, Chronos-2's grouped attention) consistently leveraging exogenous features, while other approaches show inconsistent benefits. Geographic context emerges as equally important, with foundation models demonstrating advantages primarily in variable climates. These results challenge assumptions about universal foundation model superiority and highlight the need for domain-specific models, specifically in the energy domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 Figure and 3 Tables.

| **[A Decomposition-based State Space Model for Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05389v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for decision-making in domains such as weather, energy, and finance. It remains challenging because real-world sequences intertwine slow trends, multi-rate seasonalities, and irregular residuals. Existing methods often rely on rigid, hand-crafted decompositions or generic end-to-end architectures that entangle components and underuse structure shared across variables. To address these limitations, we propose DecompSSM, an end-to-end decomposition framework using three parallel deep state space model branches to capture trend, seasonal, and residual components. The model features adaptive temporal scales via an input-dependent predictor, a refinement module for shared cross-variable context, and an auxiliary loss that enforces reconstruction and orthogonality. Across standard benchmarks (ECL, Weather, ETTm2, and PEMS04), DecompSSM outperformed strong baselines, indicating the effectiveness of combining component-wise deep state space models and global context refinement.</p></details> | ICASSP2026 |

To address the difficiency in multivariate models, we introduce a method to Construct Auxiliary Time Series (CATS) that functions like a 2D temporal-contextual attention mechanism, which generates Auxiliary Time Series (ATS) from Original Time Series (OTS) to effectively represent and incorporate inter-series relationships for forecasting. Key principles of ATS - continuity, sparsity, and variability - are identified and implemented through different modules. Even with a basic 2-layer MLP as core predictor, CATS achieves state-of-the-art, significantly reducing complexity and parameters compared to previous multivariate models, marking it an efficient and transferable MTSF solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version.

Recent research has demonstrated that neural audio codec (NAC) provides superior speaker feature disentanglement and linguistic fidelity. NAC can also be used with causal language models (LM) to enhance linguistic fidelity and prompt control for streaming tasks. However, existing NAC-based online LM systems are designed for voice conversion (VC) rather than anonymization, lacking the techniques required for privacy protection. Building on these advances, we present Stream-Voice-Anon, which adapts modern causal LM-based NAC architectures specifically for streaming SA by integrating anonymization techniques. Our anonymization approach incorporates pseudo-speaker representation sampling, a speaker embedding mixing and diverse prompt selection strategies for LM conditioning that leverage the disentanglement properties of quantized content codes to prevent speaker information leakage. Additionally, we compare dynamic and fixed delay configurations to explore latency-privacy trade-offs in real-time scenarios. Under the VoicePrivacy 2024 Challenge protocol, Stream-Voice-Anon achieves substantial improvements in intelligibility (up to 46% relative WER reduction) and emotion preservation (up to 28% UAR relative) compared to the previous state-of-the-art streaming method DarkStream while maintaining comparable latency (180ms vs 200ms) and privacy protection against lazy-informed attackers, though showing 15% relative degradation against semi-informed attackers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2026.

To fully utilize the in-context capabilities in time series forecasting (TSF) problems, unlike previous Transformer-based or LLM-based time series forecasting methods, we reformulate "time series forecasting tasks" as input tokens by constructing a series of (lookback, future) pairs within the tokens. This method aligns more closely with the inherent in-context mechanisms, and is more parameter-efficient without the need of using pre-trained LLM parameters. Furthermore, it addresses issues such as overfitting in existing Transformer-based TSF models, consistently achieving better performance across full-data, few-shot, and zero-shot settings compared to previous architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version.

It can adapt to various attention mechanisms, enhancing and decoupling their ability to capture long-range and local temporal patterns in time series data. In this paper, we first demonstrate that, for the time series forecasting (TSF) task, the previously overlooked decoder-only autoregressive Transformer model can achieve results comparable to the best baselines when appropriate tokenization and training methods are applied. Moreover, inspired by the ARMA model from statistics and recent advances in linear attention, we introduce the full ARMA structure into existing autoregressive attention mechanisms. By using an indirect MA weight generation method, we incorporate the MA term while maintaining the time complexity and parameter size of the underlying efficient attention models. We further explore how indirect parameter generation can produce implicit MA weights that align with the modeling requirements for local temporal impacts. Experimental results show that WAVE attention that incorporates the ARMA structure consistently improves the performance of various AR attentions on TSF tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version.

| **[MentorCollab: Selective Large-to-Small Inference-Time Guidance for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05307v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by producing long chains of thought, but their inference costs are high and often generate redundant reasoning. Small language models (SLMs) are far more efficient, yet struggle on multi-step reasoning tasks. A natural idea is to let a large model guide a small one at inference time as a mentor, yet existing collaboration methods often promote imitation, resulting in verbose reasoning without consistent error correction. We propose MentorCollab, an inference-time collaboration method in which an LRM selectively and sparsely guides an SLM, rather than taking over generation. At randomly sampled token positions, we probe for divergences between the two models and use a lightweight verifier to decide whether the SLM should follow a short lookahead segment from its mentor or continue on its own. Across 15 SLM--LRM pairs and 3 domains (math reasoning, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning), our method improves performance in 12 settings, with average gains of 3.0% and up to 8.0%, while adopting only having 18.4% tokens generated by the expensive mentor model on average. We find that short segments and selective probing are sufficient for effective collaboration. Our results show that selective inference-time guidance restores large-model reasoning ability without substantial inference overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logarithmic-time Schedules for Scaling Language Models with Momentum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05298v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practice, the hyperparameters $(β_1, β_2)$ and weight-decay $λ$ in AdamW are typically kept at fixed values. Is there any reason to do otherwise? We show that for large-scale language model training, the answer is yes: by exploiting the power-law structure of language data, one can design time-varying schedules for $(β_1, β_2, λ)$ that deliver substantial performance gains. We study logarithmic-time scheduling, in which the optimizer's gradient memory horizon grows with training time. Although naive variants of this are unstable, we show that suitable damping mechanisms restore stability while preserving the benefits of longer memory. Based on this, we present ADANA, an AdamW-like optimizer that couples log-time schedules with explicit damping to balance stability and performance. We empirically evaluate ADANA across transformer scalings (45M to 2.6B parameters), comparing against AdamW, Muon, and AdEMAMix. When properly tuned, ADANA achieves up to 40% compute efficiency relative to a tuned AdamW, with gains that persist--and even improve--as model scale increases. We further show that similar benefits arise when applying logarithmic-time scheduling to AdEMAMix, and that logarithmic-time weight-decay alone can yield significant improvements. Finally, we present variants of ADANA that mitigate potential failure modes and improve robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Position: Universal Time Series Foundation Models Rest on a Category Error](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05287v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This position paper argues that the pursuit of "Universal Foundation Models for Time Series" rests on a fundamental category error, mistaking a structural Container for a semantic Modality. We contend that because time series hold incompatible generative processes (e.g., finance vs. fluid dynamics), monolithic models degenerate into expensive "Generic Filters" that fail to generalize under distributional drift. To address this, we introduce the "Autoregressive Blindness Bound," a theoretical limit proving that history-only models cannot predict intervention-driven regime shifts. We advocate replacing universality with a Causal Control Agent paradigm, where an agent leverages external context to orchestrate a hierarchy of specialized solvers, from frozen domain experts to lightweight Just-in-Time adaptors. We conclude by calling for a shift in benchmarks from "Zero-Shot Accuracy" to "Drift Adaptation Speed" to prioritize robust, control-theoretic systems.</p></details> | Position Paper |
| **[Robust Inference-Time Steering of Protein Diffusion Models via Embedding Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05285v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many biophysical inverse problems, the goal is to generate biomolecular conformations that are both physically plausible and consistent with experimental measurements. As recent sequence-to-structure diffusion models provide powerful data-driven priors, posterior sampling has emerged as a popular framework by guiding atomic coordinates to target conformations using experimental likelihoods. However, when the target lies in a low-density region of the prior, posterior sampling requires aggressive and brittle weighting of the likelihood guidance. Motivated by this limitation, we propose EmbedOpt, an alternative inference-time approach for steering diffusion models to optimize experimental likelihoods in the conditional embedding space. As this space encodes rich sequence and coevolutionary signals, optimizing over it effectively shifts the diffusion prior to align with experimental constraints. We validate EmbedOpt on two benchmarks simulating cryo-electron microscopy map fitting and experimental distance constraints. We show that EmbedOpt outperforms the coordinate-based posterior sampling method in map fitting tasks, matches performance on distance constraint tasks, and exhibits superior engineering robustness across hyperparameters spanning two orders of magnitude. Moreover, its smooth optimization behavior enables a significant reduction in the number of diffusion steps required for inference, leading to better efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-Replay: Efficient Test-Time Scaling for Software Engineering Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22129v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling has been widely adopted to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, the standard approach of repeatedly sampling trajectories from scratch is computationally expensive. While recent methods have attempted to mitigate costs using specialized value agents, they can suffer from model miscalibration and fail to generalize to modern agents that synthesize custom bash scripts as tools. In this paper, we introduce SWE-Replay, the first efficient and generalizable test-time scaling technique for modern agents without reliance on potentially noisy value estimates. SWE-Replay optimizes the scaling process by recycling trajectories from prior trials, dynamically choosing to either explore from scratch or exploit archived experience by branching at critical intermediate steps. This selection of intermediate steps is driven by the potential and reasoning significance of repository exploration, rather than external LLM-based quality estimates. Our evaluation shows that, on SWE-Bench Verified, SWE-Replay consistently outperforms naive scaling, reducing costs by up to 17.4% while maintaining or even improving performance by up to 3.8%. Further evaluation on SWE-Bench Pro and Multilingual validates the generalizability of SWE-Replay, establishing it as a robust foundation for efficient test-time scaling of software engineering agents.</p></details> |  |

However, similar test-time scaling for diffusion models to tackle complex reasoning remains largely unexplored. From existing work, two primary challenges emerge in this setting: (i) the dependence on an external verifier indicating a notable gap from intrinsic reasoning of human intelligence without any external feedback, and (ii) the lack of an efficient search algorithm. In this paper, we introduce the Verifier-free Test-time Scalable Diffusion Model (VFScale) to achieve scalable intrinsic reasoning, which equips number-of-sample test-time scaling with the intrinsic energy function of diffusion models as the verifier. Concretely, VFScale comprises two key innovations to address the aforementioned challenges. On the training side, VFScale consists of a novel MRNCL loss and a KL regularization to improve the energy landscape, ensuring that the learned energy function itself serves as a reliable verifier. On the inference side, VFScale integrates the denoising process with a novel hybrid Monte Carlo Tree Search (hMCTS) to improve search efficiency. On challenging reasoning tasks of Maze and Sudoku, we demonstrate the effectiveness of VFScale's training objective and scalable inference method. In particular, trained with Maze sizes of up to $6\times6$, our VFScale solves 88% of Maze problems with much larger sizes of $15\times15$, while standard diffusion models completely fail. The code can be found at https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/VFScale.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026. 30 pages, 13 figures</p></details> |
| **[Real-Time Detection of Hallucinated Entities in Long-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03531v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach targets entity-level hallucinations-e.g., fabricated names, dates, citations-rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering settings. Despite being trained only to detect hallucinated entities, our probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks, indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Iterative Error Correction for Efficient Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06250v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing demand for high-quality image generation on resource-constrained devices, efficient diffusion models have received increasing attention. However, such models suffer from approximation errors introduced by efficiency techniques, which significantly degrade generation quality. Once deployed, these errors are difficult to correct, as modifying the model is typically infeasible in deployment environments. Through an analysis of error propagation across diffusion timesteps, we reveal that these approximation errors can accumulate exponentially, severely impairing output quality. Motivated by this insight, we propose Iterative Error Correction (IEC), a novel test-time method that mitigates inference-time errors by iteratively refining the model's output. IEC is theoretically proven to reduce error propagation from exponential to linear growth, without requiring any retraining or architectural changes. IEC can seamlessly integrate into the inference process of existing diffusion models, enabling a flexible trade-off between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that IEC consistently improves generation quality across various datasets, efficiency techniques, and model architectures, establishing it as a practical and generalizable solution for test-time enhancement of efficient diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

A widely adopted pangenome representation is a node-labeled directed graph, wherein the paths correspond to plausible genomic sequences within a species. Consequently, evaluating sequence-to-pangenome graph similarity constitutes a fundamental task in pangenome construction and analysis. This study explores the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem and three of its variants involving a sequence and a pangenome graph. We present four polynomial-time reductions that transform these LCS-related problems into the longest path problem in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). These reductions demonstrate that all four problems can be solved in polynomial time, establishing their membership in the complexity class P.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Despite advances in multi-camera systems and high-resolution depth sensors, fusing large-scale multi-view depth observations into high-quality point clouds under strict real-time constraints remains challenging. Existing methods relying on voxel-based fusion, temporal accumulation, or global optimization suffer from high computational complexity, excessive memory usage, and limited scalability, failing to simultaneously achieve real-time performance, reconstruction quality, and multi-camera extensibility. We propose FUSE-Flow, a frame-wise, stateless, and linearly scalable point cloud streaming reconstruction framework. Each frame independently generates point cloud fragments, fused via two weights, measurement confidence and 3D distance consistency to suppress noise while preserving geometric details. For large-scale multi-camera efficiency, we introduce an adaptive spatial hashing-based weighted aggregation method: 3D space is adaptively partitioned by local point cloud density, representative points are selected per cell, and weighted fusion is performed to handle both sparse and dense regions. With GPU parallelization, FUSE-Flow achieves high-throughput, low-latency point cloud generation and fusion with linear complexity. Experiments demonstrate that the framework improves reconstruction stability and geometric fidelity in overlapping, depth-discontinuous, and dynamic scenes, while maintaining real-time frame rates on modern GPUs, verifying its effectiveness, robustness, and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>A 5-p...</summary><p>A 5-page paper, prepared for submission to the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)</p></details> |

In decision-time planning, state representations are critical as they must support local cost computation while preserving long-horizon structure. In this paper, we show that the Laplacian representation provides an effective latent space for planning by capturing state-space distances at multiple time scales. This representation preserves meaningful distances and naturally decomposes long-horizon problems into subgoals, also mitigating the compounding errors that arise over long prediction horizons. Building on these properties, we introduce ALPS, a hierarchical planning algorithm, and demonstrate that it outperforms commonly used baselines on a selection of offline goal-conditioned RL tasks from OGBench, a benchmark previously dominated by model-free methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Double Variable Importance Matching to Estimate Distinct Causal Effects on Event Probability and Timing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05022v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many clinical contexts, estimating effects of treatment in time-to-event data is complicated not only by confounding, censoring, and heterogeneity, but also by the presence of a cured subpopulation in which the event of interest never occurs. In such settings, treatment may have distinct effects on (1) the probability of being cured and (2) the event timing among non-cured individuals. Standard survival analysis and causal inference methods typically do not separate cured from non-cured individuals, obscuring distinct treatment mechanisms on cure probability and event timing. To address these challenges, we propose a matching-based framework that constructs distinct match groups to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) on cure probability and event timing, respectively. We use mixture cure models to identify feature importance for both estimands, which in turn informs weighted distance metrics for matching in high-dimensional spaces. Within matched groups, Kaplan-Meier estimators provide estimates of cure probability and expected time to event, from which individual-level treatment effects are derived. We provide theoretical guarantees for estimator consistency and distance metric optimality under an equal-scale constraint. We further decompose estimation error into contributions from censoring, model fitting, and irreducible noise. Simulations and real-world data analyses demonstrate that our approach delivers interpretable and robust HTE estimates in time-to-event settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking hidden biomolecular conformational landscapes in diffusion models at inference time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03312v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The function of biomolecules such as proteins depends on their ability to interconvert between a wide range of structures or "conformations." Researchers have endeavored for decades to develop computational methods to predict the distribution of conformations, which is far harder to determine experimentally than a static folded structure. We present ConforMix, an inference-time algorithm that enhances sampling of conformational distributions using a combination of classifier guidance, filtering, and free energy estimation. Our approach upgrades diffusion models -- whether trained for static structure prediction or conformational generation -- to enable more efficient discovery of conformational variability without requiring prior knowledge of major degrees of freedom. ConforMix is orthogonal to improvements in model pretraining and would benefit even a hypothetical model that perfectly reproduced the Boltzmann distribution. Remarkably, when applied to a diffusion model trained for static structure prediction, ConforMix captures structural changes including domain motion, cryptic pocket flexibility, and transporter cycling, while avoiding unphysical states. Case studies of biologically critical proteins demonstrate the scalability, accuracy, and utility of this method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/drorlab/conformix</p></details> |

While many LLMs undergo post-training alignment and safety procedures to avoid expressions of explicit social bias, they still exhibit significant implicit biases on indirect tasks resembling the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Recent work has further shown that inference-time reasoning can impair LLM performance on tasks that rely on implicit statistical learning. Motivated by a theoretical link between implicit associations and statistical learning in human cognition, we examine how reasoning-enabled inference affects implicit bias in LLMs. We find that enabling reasoning significantly reduces measured implicit bias on an IAT-style evaluation for some model classes across fifteen stereotype topics. This effect appears specific to social bias domains, as we observe no corresponding reduction for non-social implicit associations. As reasoning is increasingly enabled by default in deployed LLMs, these findings suggest that it can meaningfully alter fairness evaluation outcomes in some systems, while also raising questions about how alignment procedures interact with inference-time reasoning to drive variation in bias reduction across model types. More broadly, this work highlights how theory from cognitive science and psychology can complement AI evaluation research by providing methodological and interpretive frameworks that reveal new insights into model behavior.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, computer vision has been used to automate several tasks in precision agriculture, such as detecting and counting fruits, and estimating their size. However, the fundamental problem of matching the exact same fruits from one video, collected on a given date, to the fruits visible in another video, collected on a later date, which is needed to track fruits' growth through time, remains to be solved. Few attempts were made, but they either assume that the camera always starts from the same known position and that there are sufficiently distinct features to match, or they used other sources of data like GPS. Here we propose a new paradigm to tackle this problem, based on constellations of 3D centroids, and introduce a descriptor for very sparse 3D point clouds that can be used to match fruits across videos. Matching constellations instead of individual fruits is key to deal with non-rigidity, occlusions and challenging imagery with few distinct visual features to track. The results show that the proposed method can be successfully used to match fruits across videos and through time, and also to build an orchard map and later use it to locate the camera pose in 6DoF, thus providing a method for autonomous navigation of robots in the orchard and for selective fruit picking, for example.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation</p></details> |

This task arises in many application domains, such as healthcare and finance, where mispredictions can have a high cost and reduce trust. The learning with abstention framework tackles these problems by allowing a model to abstain from offering a prediction when it is at an elevated risk of making a misprediction. Unfortunately, existing abstention strategies are ill-suited for the multi-horizon setting: they target problems where a model offers a single prediction for each instance. Hence, they ignore the structured and correlated nature of the predictions offered by a multi-horizon forecaster. We formalize the problem of learning with abstention for multi-horizon forecasting setting and show that its structured nature admits a richer set of abstention problems. Concretely, we propose three natural notions of how a model could abstain for multi-horizon forecasting. We theoretically analyze each problem to derive the optimal abstention strategy and propose an algorithm that implements it. Extensive evaluation on 24 datasets shows that our proposed algorithms significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Traditional point prediction methods often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in time series data, while existing probabilistic approaches struggle to balance computational efficiency with interpretability. We propose a novel Multi-Expert Learning Distributional Labels (LDL) framework that addresses these challenges through mixture-of-experts architectures with distributional learning capabilities. Our approach introduces two complementary methods: (1) Multi-Expert LDL, which employs multiple experts with different learned parameters to capture diverse temporal patterns, and (2) Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE, which explicitly decomposes time series into interpretable components (trend, seasonality, changepoints, volatility) through specialized sub-experts. Both frameworks extend traditional point prediction to distributional learning, enabling rich uncertainty quantification through Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We evaluate our methods on aggregated sales data derived from the M5 dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline approaches. The continuous Multi-Expert LDL achieves the best overall performance, while the Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE provides enhanced interpretability through component-wise analysis. Our frameworks successfully balance predictive accuracy with interpretability, making them suitable for real-world forecasting applications where both performance and actionable insights are crucial.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2figures |

Especially energy systems are difficult to handle as they exhibit instantaneous as well as delayed effects and if equipped with storage, do have a memory. In this paper we adapt the causal root-cause analysis method of Budhathoki et al. [2022] to general time-dependent systems, as it can be regarded as a strictly causal definition of the term "root-cause". Particularly, we discuss two truncation approaches to handle the infinite dependency graphs present in time-dependent systems. While one leaves the causal mechanisms intact, the other approximates the mechanisms at the start nodes. The effectiveness of the different approaches is benchmarked using a challenging data generation process inspired by a problem in factory energy management: the avoidance of peaks in the power consumption. We show that given enough lags our extension is able to localize the root-causes in the feature and time domain. Further the effect of mechanism approximation is discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Six Times to Spare: LDPC Acceleration on DGX Spark for AI-Native Open RAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04652v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoding is one of the most computationally intensive kernels in the 5G New Radio (NR) physical layer and must complete within a 0.5\,ms transmission time interval while sharing the budget with FFT, channel estimation, demapping, HARQ, and MAC scheduling. Many open and proprietary stacks still execute LDPC on general-purpose CPUs, raising concerns about missed-slot events and limited scalability as bandwidths, modulation orders, and user multiplexing increase. This paper empirically quantifies the benefit of offloading 5G-style LDPC5G decoding from a Grace CPU to the integrated Blackwell GB10 GPU on an NVIDIA DGX~Spark platform. Using NVIDIA Sionna PHY/SYS on TensorFlow, we construct an NR-like link-level chain with an LDPC5G encoder/decoder, 16-QAM modulation, and AWGN, and sweep both the number of codewords decoded in parallel and the number of belief-propagation iterations, timing only the decoding phase while logging CPU and GPU utilization and power. Across the sweep we observe an average GPU/CPU throughput speedup of approximately $6\times$, with per-codeword CPU latency reaching $\approx 0.71$\,ms at 20 iterations (exceeding the 0.5\,ms slot), while the GB10 GPU remains within 6--24\% of the slot for the same workloads. Resource-usage measurements show that CPU-based LDPC decoding often consumes around ten Grace cores, whereas GPU-based decoding adds only $\approx10-15$\,W over GPU idle while leaving most CPU capacity available for higher-layer tasks. Because our implementation relies on high-level Sionna layers rather than hand-tuned CUDA, these results represent conservative lower bounds on achievable accelerator performance and provide a reusable, scriptable methodology for evaluating LDPC and other physical-layer kernels on future Grace/Blackwell and Aerial/ACAR/AODT platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 1 equation</p></details> |

While Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) offer a promising framework for modeling the latent evolution of these systems, their application is hindered by representation collapse and an inability to capture precursor signals across varying temporal scales. To address these limitations, we propose MTS-JEPA, a specialized architecture that integrates a multi-resolution predictive objective with a soft codebook bottleneck. This design explicitly decouples transient shocks from long-term trends, and utilizes the codebook to capture discrete regime transitions. Notably, we find this constraint also acts as an intrinsic regularizer to ensure optimization stability. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks confirm that our approach effectively prevents degenerate solutions and achieves state-of-the-art performance under the early-warning protocol.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time processing of analog signals on accelerated neuromorphic hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04582v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensory processing with neuromorphic systems is typically done by using either event-based sensors or translating input signals to spikes before presenting them to the neuromorphic processor. Here, we offer an alternative approach: direct analog signal injection eliminates superfluous and power-intensive analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversions, making it particularly suitable for efficient near-sensor processing. We demonstrate this by using the accelerated BrainScaleS-2 mixed-signal neuromorphic research platform and interfacing it directly to microphones and a servo-motor-driven actuator. Utilizing BrainScaleS-2's 1000-fold acceleration factor, we employ a spiking neural network to transform interaural time differences into a spatial code and thereby predict the location of sound sources. Our primary contributions are the first demonstrations of direct, continuous-valued sensor data injection into the analog compute units of the BrainScaleS-2 ASIC, and actuator control using its embedded microprocessors. This enables a fully on-chip processing pipeline$\unicode{x2014}$from sensory input handling, via spiking neural network processing to physical action. We showcase this by programming the system to localize and align a servo motor with the spatial direction of transient noise peaks in real-time.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Evaluating the Viability of Additive Models to Predict Task Completion Time for 3D Interactions in Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23209v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Additive models of interaction performance, such as the Keystroke-Level Model (KLM), are tools that allow designers to compare and optimize the performance of user interfaces by summing the predicted times for the atomic components of a specific interaction to predict the total time it would take to complete that interaction. There has been extensive work in creating such additive models for 2D interfaces, but this approach has rarely been explored for 3D user interfaces. We propose a KLM-style additive model, based on existing atomic task models in the literature, to predict task completion time for 3D interaction tasks. We performed two studies to evaluate the feasibility of this approach across multiple input modalities, with one study using a simple menu selection task and the other a more complex manipulation task. We found that several of the models from the literature predicted actual task performance with less than 20% error in both the menu selection and manipulation study. Overall, we found that additive models can predict both absolute and relative performance of input modalities with reasonable accuracy.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce TouchGuide, a novel cross-policy visuo-tactile fusion paradigm that fuses modalities within a low-dimensional action space. Specifically, TouchGuide operates in two stages to guide a pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching visuomotor policy at inference time. First, the policy produces a coarse, visually-plausible action using only visual inputs during early sampling. Second, a task-specific Contact Physical Model (CPM) provides tactile guidance to steer and refine the action, ensuring it aligns with realistic physical contact conditions. Trained through contrastive learning on limited expert demonstrations, the CPM provides a tactile-informed feasibility score to steer the sampling process toward refined actions that satisfy physical contact constraints. Furthermore, to facilitate TouchGuide training with high-quality and cost-effective data, we introduce TacUMI, a data collection system. TacUMI achieves a favorable trade-off between precision and affordability; by leveraging rigid fingertips, it obtains direct tactile feedback, thereby enabling the collection of reliable tactile data. Extensive experiments on five challenging contact-rich tasks, such as shoe lacing and chip handover, show that TouchGuide consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art visuo-tactile policies.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a unified framework that fuses LiDAR, GNSS, and IMU data for high-resolution city-scale mapping. The method performs velocity-based temporal alignment using Dynamic Time Warping and refines GNSS and IMU signals via extended Kalman filtering. Local maps are built using Normal Distributions Transform-based registration and pose graph optimization with loop closure detection, while global consistency is enforced using GNSS-constrained anchors followed by fine registration of overlapping segments. We also introduce a large-scale multimodal dataset captured in Perth, Western Australia to facilitate future research in this direction. Our dataset comprises 144,000 frames acquired with a 128-channel Ouster LiDAR, synchronized RTK-GNSS trajectories, and MEMS-IMU measurements across 21 urban loops. To assess geometric consistency, we evaluated our method using alignment metrics based on road centerlines and intersections to capture both global and local accuracy. The proposed framework reduces the average global alignment error from 3.32m to 1.24m, achieving a 61.4% improvement, and significantly decreases the intersection centroid offset from 13.22m to 2.01m, corresponding to an 84.8% enhancement. The constructed high-fidelity map and raw dataset are publicly available through https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/perth-cbd-high-resolution-lidar-map-gnss-and-imu-calibration, and its visualization can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZUgs1KyMks.

Yet current high-precision segmentation models rely on GPUs, making them impractical to deploy in primary hospitals, mobile endoscopy units, or capsule robots. To bridge this gap, we present the UltraSeg family, operating in an extreme-compression regime (<0.3 M parameters). UltraSeg-108K (0.108 M parameters) is optimized for single-center data, while UltraSeg-130K (0.13 M parameters) generalizes to multi-center, multi-modal images. By jointly optimizing encoder-decoder widths, incorporating constrained dilated convolutions to enlarge receptive fields, and integrating a cross-layer lightweight fusion module, the models achieve 90 FPS on a single CPU core without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluated on seven public datasets, UltraSeg retains >94% of the Dice score of a 31 M-parameter U-Net while utilizing only 0.4% of its parameters, establishing a strong, clinically viable baseline for the extreme-compression domain and offering an immediately deployable solution for resource-constrained settings. This work provides not only a CPU-native solution for colonoscopy but also a reproducible blueprint for broader minimally invasive surgical vision applications. Source code is publicly available to ensure reproducibility and facilitate future benchmarking.</p></details> | 19pages, 5 figures |
| **[Reducing the labeling burden in time-series mapping using Common Ground: a semi-automated approach to tracking changes in land cover and species over time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04373v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable classification of Earth Observation data depends on consistent, up-to-date reference labels. However, collecting new labelled data at each time step remains expensive and logistically difficult, especially in dynamic or remote ecological systems. As a response to this challenge, we demonstrate that a model with access to reference data solely from time step t0 can perform competitively on both t0 and a future time step t1, outperforming models trained separately on time-specific reference data (the gold standard). This finding suggests that effective temporal generalization can be achieved without requiring manual updates to reference labels beyond the initial time step t0. Drawing on concepts from change detection and semi-supervised learning (SSL), the most performant approach, "Common Ground", uses a semi-supervised framework that leverages temporally stable regions-areas with little to no change in spectral or semantic characteristics between time steps-as a source of implicit supervision for dynamic regions. We evaluate this strategy across multiple classifiers, sensors (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral and airborne imaging spectroscopy), and ecological use cases. For invasive tree species mapping, we observed a 21-40% improvement in classification accuracy using Common Ground compared to naive temporal transfer, where models trained at a single time step are directly applied to a future time step. We also observe a 10 -16% higher accuracy for the introduced approach compared to a gold-standard approach. In contrast, when broad land cover categories were mapped across Europe, we observed a more modest 2% increase in accuracy compared to both the naive and gold-standard approaches. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining stable reference screening with SSL for scalable and label-efficient multi-temporal remote sensing classification.</p></details> |  |

The core idea lies in effectively aligning the modality between natural language and time series. However, the multi-scale structures of natural language and time series have not been fully considered, resulting in insufficient utilization of LLMs capabilities. To this end, we propose MSH-LLM, a Multi-Scale Hypergraph method that aligns Large Language Models for time series analysis. Specifically, a hyperedging mechanism is designed to enhance the multi-scale semantic information of time series semantic space. Then, a cross-modality alignment (CMA) module is introduced to align the modality between natural language and time series at different scales. In addition, a mixture of prompts (MoP) mechanism is introduced to provide contextual information and enhance the ability of LLMs to understand the multi-scale temporal patterns of time series. Experimental results on 27 real-world datasets across 5 different applications demonstrate that MSH-LLM achieves the state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2026 |

However, existing methods depend on control signals at inference time to guide the generative model towards temporally consistent generation of dynamic objects, limiting their utility as scalable and generalizable data engines. In this work, we propose Localized Semantic Alignment (LSA), a simple yet effective framework for fine-tuning pre-trained video generation models. LSA enhances temporal consistency by aligning semantic features between ground-truth and generated video clips. Specifically, we compare the output of an off-the-shelf feature extraction model between the ground-truth and generated video clips localized around dynamic objects inducing a semantic feature consistency loss. We fine-tune the base model by combining this loss with the standard diffusion loss. The model fine-tuned for a single epoch with our novel loss outperforms the baselines in common video generation evaluation metrics. To further test the temporal consistency in generated videos we adapt two additional metrics from object detection task, namely mAP and mIoU. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing temporal consistency in video generation without the need for external control signals during inference and any computational overheads.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE IV 2026. 8 pages, 3 figures.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in TKGQA, current prompting strategies constrain their efficacy in two primary ways. First, they are prone to reasoning hallucinations under complex temporal constraints. Second, static prompting limits model autonomy and generalization, as it lack optimization through dynamic interaction with temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) environments. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{TKG-Thinker}, a novel agent equipped with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities for reasoning over TKGs. Specifically, TKG-Thinker performs in-depth temporal reasoning through dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs via a dual-training strategy. We first apply Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of thought data to instill core planning capabilities, followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that leverages multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies under intricate temporal constraints. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with three open-source LLMs show that TKG-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generalization across complex TKGQA settings.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, the search space of the dynamic graphs is combinatorial in nature. In this study, we propose \textit{Stable Causal Dynamic Differentiable Discovery (SC3D)}, a two-stage differentiable framework that jointly learns lag-specific adjacency matrices and, if present, an instantaneous directed acyclic graph (DAG). In Stage 1, SC3D performs edge preselection through node-wise prediction to obtain masks for lagged and instantaneous edges, whereas Stage 2 refines these masks by optimizing a likelihood with sparsity along with enforcing acyclicity on the instantaneous block. Numerical results across synthetic and benchmark dynamical systems demonstrate that SC3D achieves improved stability and more accurate recovery of both lagged and instantaneous causal structures compared to existing temporal baselines.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Exploring the Temporal Consistency for Point-Level Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05718v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point-supervised Temporal Action Localization (PTAL) adopts a lightly frame-annotated paradigm (\textit{i.e.}, labeling only a single frame per action instance) to train a model to effectively locate action instances within untrimmed videos. Most existing approaches design the task head of models with only a point-supervised snippet-level classification, without explicit modeling of understanding temporal relationships among frames of an action. However, understanding the temporal relationships of frames is crucial because it can help a model understand how an action is defined and therefore benefits localizing the full frames of an action. To this end, in this paper, we design a multi-task learning framework that fully utilizes point supervision to boost the model's temporal understanding capability for action localization. Specifically, we design three self-supervised temporal understanding tasks: (i) Action Completion, (ii) Action Order Understanding, and (iii) Action Regularity Understanding. These tasks help a model understand the temporal consistency of actions across videos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explicitly explore temporal consistency for point supervision action localization. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Towards their part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, REArtGS introduces a category-agnostic approach using multi-view RGB images at two different states. However, we observe that REArtGS still struggles with screw-joint or multi-part objects and lacks geometric constraints for unseen states. In this paper, we propose REArtGS++, a novel method towards generalizable articulated object reconstruction with temporal geometry constraint and planar Gaussian splatting. We first model a decoupled screw motion for each joint without type prior, and jointly optimize part-aware Gaussians with joint parameters through part motion blending. To introduce time-continuous geometric constraint for articulated modeling, we encourage Gaussians to be planar and propose a temporally consistent regularization between planar normal and depth through Taylor first-order expansion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world articulated objects demonstrate our superiority in generalizable part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, compared to existing approaches.

We introduce EMSYNC, an automatic video-based symbolic music generator that creates music aligned with a video's emotional content and temporal boundaries. It follows a two-stage framework, where a pretrained video emotion classifier extracts emotional features, and a conditional music generator produces MIDI sequences guided by both emotional and temporal cues. We introduce boundary offsets, a novel temporal conditioning mechanism that enables the model to anticipate upcoming video scene cuts and align generated musical chords with them. We also propose a mapping scheme that bridges the discrete categorical outputs of the video emotion classifier with the continuous valence-arousal inputs required by the emotion-conditioned MIDI generator, enabling seamless integration of emotion information across different representations. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in objective and subjective evaluations across different video datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating music aligned to video both emotionally and temporally.

To assess their efficacy, models are evaluated on continuous-time and discrete-time temporal graph datasets, typically using a traditional batch-oriented evaluation setup. However, as we show in this work, a batch-oriented evaluation is often unsuitable and can cause several issues. Grouping edges into fixed-sized batches regardless of their occurrence time leads to information loss or leakage, depending on the temporal granularity of the data. Furthermore, fixed-size batches create time windows with different durations, resulting in an inconsistent dynamic link prediction task. In this work, we empirically show how traditional batch-based evaluation leads to skewed model performance and hinders the fair comparison of methods. We mitigate this problem by reformulating dynamic link prediction as a link forecasting task that better accounts for temporal information present in the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages (12 pages main text), 19 figures.

We introduce a temporal graph network (TGN) framework to identify information channels through which members of Congress may possess advantageous knowledge when trading company stocks. We construct a multimodal dynamic graph integrating diverse publicly available datasets, including congressional stock transactions, lobbying relationships, campaign finance contributions, and geographical connections between legislators and corporations. Our approach formulates the detection problem as a dynamic edge classification task, where we identify trades that exhibit statistically significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 across long time horizons. To handle the temporal nature of these relationships, we develop a two-step walk-forward validation architecture that respects information availability constraints and prevents look-ahead bias. We evaluate several labeling strategies based on risk-adjusted returns and demonstrate that the TGN successfully captures complex temporal dependencies between congressional-corporate interactions and subsequent trading performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[TACO: Temporal Consensus Optimization for Continual Neural Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04516v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural implicit mapping has emerged as a powerful paradigm for robotic navigation and scene understanding. However, real-world robotic deployment requires continual adaptation to changing environments under strict memory and computation constraints, which existing mapping systems fail to support. Most prior methods rely on replaying historical observations to preserve consistency and assume static scenes. As a result, they cannot adapt to continual learning in dynamic robotic settings. To address these challenges, we propose TACO (TemporAl Consensus Optimization), a replay-free framework for continual neural mapping. We reformulate mapping as a temporal consensus optimization problem, where we treat past model snapshots as temporal neighbors. Intuitively, our approach resembles a model consulting its own past knowledge. We update the current map by enforcing weighted consensus with historical representations. Our method allows reliable past geometry to constrain optimization while permitting unreliable or outdated regions to be revised in response to new observations. TACO achieves a balance between memory efficiency and adaptability without storing or replaying previous data. Through extensive simulated and real-world experiments, we show that TACO robustly adapts to scene changes, and consistently outperforms other continual learning baselines.</p></details> |  |

As multivariate input models underperforming some recent univariate counterparts, we posit that the issue lies in the inefficiency of existing multivariate LTSF Transformers to model series-wise relationships: the characteristic differences between series are often captured incorrectly. To address this, we introduce ARM: a multivariate temporal-contextual adaptive learning method, which is an enhanced architecture specifically designed for multivariate LTSF modelling. ARM employs Adaptive Univariate Effect Learning (AUEL), Random Dropping (RD) training strategy, and Multi-kernel Local Smoothing (MKLS), to better handle individual series temporal patterns and correctly learn inter-series dependencies.

Existing methods often match start and end frames by comparing frame features with two separate tokens, relying heavily on exact timestamps. However, this approach fails to capture the event's semantic continuity and integrity, leading to ambiguities. To address this, we propose E.M.Ground, a novel Vid-LLM for TVG that focuses on holistic and coherent event perception. E.M.Ground introduces three key innovations: (i) a special <event> token that aggregates information from all frames of a query event, preserving semantic continuity for accurate event matching; (ii) Savitzky-Golay smoothing to reduce noise in token-to-frame similarities across timestamps, improving prediction accuracy; (iii) multi-grained frame feature aggregation to enhance matching reliability and temporal understanding, compensating for compression-induced information loss. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that E.M.Ground consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs by significant margins.</p></details> |  |

We present TIDE (Temporal Incremental Draft Engine), a serving-engine-native framework that integrates online draft adaptation directly into high-performance LLM inference systems. TIDE reuses target model hidden states generated during inference as training signals, enabling zero-overhead draft adaptation without reloading the target model, and employs adaptive runtime control to activate speculation and training only when beneficial. TIDE exploits heterogeneous clusters by mapping decoupled inference and training to appropriate GPU classes. Across diverse real-world workloads, TIDE achieves up to 1.15x throughput improvement over static speculative decoding while reducing draft training time by 1.67x compared to approaches that recompute training signals.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often fail to capture traffic's inherent chaotic nature for effective few-shot learning. We propose CAST-CKT, a novel Chaos-Aware Spatio-Temporal and Cross-City Knowledge Transfer framework. It employs an efficient chaotic analyser to quantify traffic predictability regimes, driving several key innovations: chaos-aware attention for regime-adaptive temporal modelling; adaptive topology learning for dynamic spatial dependencies; and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment for knowledge transfer. The framework also provides horizon-specific predictions with uncertainty quantification. Theoretical analysis shows improved generalisation bounds. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks in cross-city few-shot settings show CAST-CKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in MAE and RMSE, while offering interpretable regime analysis.

| **[Score-Based Change-Point Detection and Region Localization for Spatio-Temporal Point Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04798v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study sequential change-point detection for spatio-temporal point processes, where actionable detection requires not only identifying when a distributional change occurs but also localizing where it manifests in space. While classical quickest change detection methods provide strong guarantees on detection delay and false-alarm rates, existing approaches for point-process data predominantly focus on temporal changes and do not explicitly infer affected spatial regions. We propose a likelihood-free, score-based detection framework that jointly estimates the change time and the change region in continuous space-time without assuming parametric knowledge of the pre- or post-change dynamics. The method leverages a localized and conditionally weighted Hyvärinen score to quantify event-level deviations from nominal behavior and aggregates these scores using a spatio-temporal CUSUM-type statistic over a prescribed class of spatial regions. Operating sequentially, the procedure outputs both a stopping time and an estimated change region, enabling real-time detection with spatial interpretability. We establish theoretical guarantees on false-alarm control, detection delay, and spatial localization accuracy, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through simulations and real-world spatio-temporal event data.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Silence Is Golden: Can LLMs Learn to Abstain in Temporal QA and Beyond?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04755v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) rarely admit uncertainty, often producing fluent but misleading answers, rather than abstaining (i.e., refusing to answer). This weakness is even evident in temporal question answering, where models frequently ignore time-sensitive evidence and conflate facts across different time-periods. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of training LLMs with an abstention ability while reasoning about temporal QA. Existing approaches such as calibration might be unreliable in capturing uncertainty in complex reasoning. We instead frame abstention as a teachable skill and introduce a pipeline that couples Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision with Reinforcement Learning (RL) guided by abstention-aware rewards. Our goal is to systematically analyze how different information types and training techniques affect temporal reasoning with abstention behavior in LLMs. Through extensive experiments studying various methods, we find that RL yields strong empirical gains on reasoning: a model initialized by Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct surpasses GPT-4o by $3.46\%$ and $5.80\%$ in Exact Match on TimeQA-Easy and Hard, respectively. Moreover, it improves the True Positive rate on unanswerable questions by $20\%$ over a pure supervised fine-tuned (SFT) variant. Beyond performance, our analysis shows that SFT induces overconfidence and harms reliability, while RL improves prediction accuracy but exhibits similar risks. Finally, by comparing implicit reasoning cues (e.g., original context, temporal sub-context, knowledge graphs) with explicit CoT supervision, we find that implicit information provides limited benefit for reasoning with abstention. Our study provides new insights into how abstention and reasoning can be jointly optimized, providing a foundation for building more reliable LLMs.</p></details> | Accepted to ICLR2026 |

Training models to skip steps in their trajectories helps capture long-term dependencies without additional memory or computational cost. However, predicting excessively sparse plans degrades performance. We hypothesize this temporal density threshold is non-uniform across a planning horizon and that certain parts of a predicted trajectory should be more densely generated. We propose Mixed-Density Diffuser (MDD), a diffusion planner where the densities throughout the horizon are tunable hyperparameters. We show that MDD surpasses the SOTA Diffusion Veteran (DV) framework across the Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning (D4RL) task domains, achieving a new SOTA on the D4RL benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Europ...</summary><p>European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning (ESANN) (under review)</p></details> |
| **[Edit-Based Flow Matching for Temporal Point Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06050v3)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal point processes (TPPs) are a fundamental tool for modeling event sequences in continuous time, but most existing approaches rely on autoregressive parameterizations that are limited by their sequential sampling. Recent non-autoregressive, diffusion-style models mitigate these issues by jointly interpolating between noise and data through event insertions and deletions in a discrete Markov chain. In this work, we generalize this perspective and introduce an Edit Flow process for TPPs that transports noise to data via insert, delete, and substitute edit operations. By learning the instantaneous edit rates within a continuous-time Markov chain framework, we attain a flexible and efficient model that effectively reduces the total number of necessary edit operations during generation. Empirical results demonstrate the generative flexibility of our unconditionally trained model in a wide range of unconditional and conditional generation tasks on benchmark TPPs.</p></details> |  |

Importantly, the visual system processes with high resolution only the center of its field of view and learns similar representations for visual inputs occurring close in time. This emphasizes slowly changing information around gaze locations. This study investigates the role of central vision and slowness learning in the formation of semantic object representations from human-like visual experience. We simulate five months of human-like visual experience using the Ego4D dataset and generate gaze coordinates with a state-of-the-art gaze prediction model. Using these predictions, we extract crops that mimic central vision and train a time-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning model on them. Our results show that combining temporal slowness and central vision improves the encoding of different semantic facets of object representations. Specifically, focusing on central vision strengthens the extraction of foreground object features, while considering temporal slowness, especially during fixational eye movements, allows the model to encode broader semantic information about objects. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which humans may develop semantic object representations from natural visual experience.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

Although cooperative perception has exceeded the detection capabilities of single-agent systems, prevalent camera-based algorithms in cooperative perception neglect valuable information derived from historical observations. This limitation becomes critical during sensor failures or communication issues as cooperative perception reverts to single-agent perception, leading to degraded performance and incomplete BEV segmentation maps. This paper introduces TempCoBEV, a temporal module designed to incorporate historical cues into current observations, thereby improving the quality and reliability of BEV map segmentations. We propose an importance-guided attention architecture to effectively integrate temporal information that prioritizes relevant properties for BEV map segmentation. TempCoBEV is an independent temporal module that seamlessly integrates into state-of-the-art camera-based cooperative perception models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset that TempCoBEV performs better than non-temporal models in predicting current and future BEV map segmentations, particularly in scenarios involving communication failures. We show the efficacy of TempCoBEV and its capability to integrate historical cues into the current BEV map, improving predictions under optimal communication conditions by up to 2% and under communication failures by up to 19%.

While existing methods rely primarily on RGB features and temporal smoothing, they struggle with depth ordering, scale drift, and occlusion-induced instabilities. We propose a comprehensive depth-guided framework that achieves metric-aware temporal consistency through three synergistic components: A Depth-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion module that adaptively integrates geometric priors with RGB features via confidence-aware gating; A Depth-guided Metric-Aware Pose and Shape (D-MAPS) estimator that leverages depth-calibrated bone statistics for scale-consistent initialization; A Motion-Depth Aligned Refinement (MoDAR) module that enforces temporal coherence through cross-modal attention between motion dynamics and geometric cues. Our method achieves superior results on three challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against heavy occlusion and spatial accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the leading vision-language systems that tokenize videos through a naive frame-sampling strategy, we propose to decouple the spatial and temporal representations of videos by retaining the spatial features of a single key frame while encoding each subsequent frame into a single residual token, achieving compact yet expressive video tokenization. Our experiments suggest that VTok effectively reduces the complexity of video representation from the product of frame count and per-frame token count to their sum, while the residual tokens sufficiently capture viewpoint and motion changes relative to the key frame. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of VTok: it achieves notably higher performance on a range of video understanding and text-to-video generation benchmarks compared with baselines using naive tokenization, all with shorter token sequences per video (e.g., 3.4% higher accuracy on our TV-Align benchmark and 1.9% higher VBench score). Remarkably, VTok produces more coherent motion and stronger guidance following in text-to-video generation, owing to its more consistent temporal encoding. We hope VTok can serve as a standardized video tokenization paradigm for future research in video understanding and generation.</p></details> |  |

Prior HCI research has examined how temporal feedback, such as feedback mode (Elapsed-Time vs. Remaining-Time) shapes wait-time perception. However, few studies have investigated how such feedback influences users' downstream task performance, as well as overall affective and cognitive experience. To study these effects, we conducted an online experiment where 425 participants performing a visual reasoning task experienced a 10-, 30-, or 60-second wait with a Remaining-Time, Elapsed-Time, or No Time Display. Findings show that temporal feedback mode shapes how waiting is perceived: Remaining-Time feedback increased frustration relative to Elapsed-Time feedback, while No Time Display made waits feel longer and heightened ambiguity. Notably, these experiential differences did not translate into differences in post-wait task performance. Integrating psychophysical and cognitive science perspectives, we discuss implications for implementing temporal feedback in latency-prone digital systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in ACM CHI 2026</p></details> |

Prior approaches mitigate this via explicit smoothness penalties, trajectory regularization, or modified probability paths and solvers. We introduce Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC), a lightweight variance-reduction principle that couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path, operating entirely at the estimator level without modifying the model architecture, probability path, or solver. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that TPC induces a quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization that provably reduces gradient variance while preserving the underlying flow-matching objective. Instantiated within flow matching, TPC improves sample quality and efficiency across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at multiple resolutions, achieving lower FID at identical or lower computational cost than prior methods, and extends seamlessly to modern SOTA-style pipelines with noise-augmented training, score-based denoising, and rectified flow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Motif Participation Profiles for Analyzing Node Similarity in Temporal Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06465v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal networks consisting of timestamped interactions between a set of nodes provide a useful representation for analyzing complex networked systems that evolve over time. Beyond pairwise interactions between nodes, temporal motifs capture patterns of higher-order interactions such as directed triangles over short time periods. We propose temporal motif participation profiles (TMPPs) to capture the behavior of nodes in temporal motifs. Two nodes with similar TMPPs take similar positions within temporal motifs, possibly with different nodes. TMPPs serve as unsupervised embeddings for nodes in temporal networks that are directly interpretable, as each entry denotes the frequency at which a node participates in a particular position in a specific temporal motif. We demonstrate that clustering TMPPs reveals groups of nodes with similar roles in a temporal network through simulation experiments and a case study on a network of militarized interstate disputes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2026)</p></details> |

However, brain shift invalidates the preoperative MRI after dural opening. Updated intraoperative brain MRI with brain shift compensation is crucial for enhancing the precision of neuronavigation systems and ensuring the optimal outcome of surgical interventions. Methodology: We propose NeuralShift, a U-Net-based model that predicts brain shift entirely from pre-operative MRI for patients undergoing temporal lobe resection. We evaluated our results using Target Registration Errors (TREs) computed on anatomical landmarks located on the resection side and along the midline, and DICE scores comparing predicted intraoperative masks with masks derived from intraoperative MRI. Results: Our experimental results show that our model can predict the global deformation of the brain (DICE of 0.97) with accurate local displacements (achieve landmark TRE as low as 1.12 mm), compensating for large brain shifts during temporal lobe removal neurosurgery. Conclusion: Our proposed model is capable of predicting the global deformation of the brain during temporal lobe resection using only preoperative images, providing potential opportunities to the surgical team to increase safety and efficiency of neurosurgery and better outcomes to patients. Our contributions will be publicly available after acceptance in https://github.com/SurgicalDataScienceKCL/NeuralShift.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Sequential Neural Network with Spatial-Temporal Attention and Linear LSTM for Robust Lane Detection Using Multi-Frame Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03669v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lane detection is a crucial perception task for all levels of automated vehicles (AVs) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, particularly in mixed-traffic environments where AVs must interact with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and challenging traffic scenarios. Current methods lack versatility in delivering accurate, robust, and real-time compatible lane detection, especially vision-based methods often neglect critical regions of the image and their spatial-temporal (ST) salience, leading to poor performance in difficult circumstances such as serious occlusion and dazzle lighting. This study introduces a novel sequential neural network model with a spatial-temporal attention mechanism to focus on key features of lane lines and exploit salient ST correlations among continuous image frames. The proposed model, built on a standard encoder-decoder structure and common neural network backbones, is trained and evaluated on three large-scale open-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strength and robustness of the proposed model, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in various testing scenarios. Furthermore, with the ST attention mechanism, the developed sequential neural network models exhibit fewer parameters and reduced Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) compared to baseline sequential models, highlighting their computational efficiency.

We present a case study on short-term forecasting of daily maximum temperature and precipitation across the conterminous United States using novel scalable spatio-temporal Gaussian process methodology. Building on three approximation families - inducing-point methods (FITC), Vecchia approximations, and a hybrid Vecchia-inducing-point full-scale approach (VIF) - we introduce three extensions that address key bottlenecks in large space-time settings: (i) a scalable correlation-based neighbor selection strategy for Vecchia approximations with point-referenced data, enabling accurate conditioning under complex dependence structures, (ii) a space-time kMeans++ inducing-point selection algorithm, and (iii) GPU-accelerated implementations of computationally expensive operations, including matrix operations and neighbor searches. Using both synthetic experiments and a large NOAA station dataset containing approximately 1.7 million space-time observations, we analyze the models with respect to predictive performance, parameter estimation, and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate that scalable Gaussian process models can yield accurate continental-scale forecasts while remaining computationally feasible, offering practical tools for weather applications.</p></details> |  |

However, current Vid-LLMs struggle to simultaneously retain high-quality frame-level semantic information (i.e., a sufficient number of tokens per frame) and comprehensive video-level temporal information (i.e., an adequate number of sampled frames per video). This limitation hinders the advancement of Vid-LLMs towards fine-grained video understanding. To address this issue, we introduce the SlowFocus mechanism, which significantly enhances the equivalent sampling frequency without compromising the quality of frame-level visual tokens. SlowFocus begins by identifying the query-related temporal segment based on the posed question, then performs dense sampling on this segment to extract local high-frequency features. A multi-frequency mixing attention module is further leveraged to aggregate these local high-frequency details with global low-frequency contexts for enhanced temporal comprehension. Additionally, to tailor Vid-LLMs to this innovative mechanism, we introduce a set of training strategies aimed at bolstering both temporal grounding and detailed temporal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we establish FineAction-CGR, a benchmark specifically devised to assess the ability of Vid-LLMs to process fine-grained temporal understanding tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our mechanism across both existing public video understanding benchmarks and our proposed FineAction-CGR.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

To address this problem, we propose DeepDFA, a neurosymbolic framework that integrates high-level temporal logic - expressed as Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) or Moore Machines - into neural architectures. DeepDFA models temporal rules as continuous, differentiable layers, enabling symbolic knowledge injection into subsymbolic domains. We demonstrate how DeepDFA can be used in two key settings: (i) static image sequence classification, and (ii) policy learning in interactive non-Markovian environments. Across extensive experiments, DeepDFA outperforms traditional deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers) and novel neuro-symbolic systems, achieving state-of-the-art results in temporal knowledge integration. These results highlight the potential of DeepDFA to bridge subsymbolic learning and symbolic reasoning in sequential tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this, we introduce UrbanGraph, a framework founded on a novel structure-based inductive bias. Unlike implicit graph learning, UrbanGraph transforms physical first principles into a dynamic causal topology, explicitly encoding time-varying causalities (e.g., shading and convection) directly into the graph structure to ensure physical consistency and data efficiency. Results show that UrbanGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance across all baselines. Specifically, the use of explicit causal pruning significantly reduces the model's floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 73.8% and increases training speed by 21% compared to implicit graphs. Our contribution includes the first high-resolution benchmark for spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and a generalizable explicit topological encoding paradigm applicable to urban spatio-temporal dynamics governed by known physical equations.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in continual parameter-efficient tuning (PET) of pretrained models show promise, they typically rely on multiple training epochs and explicit task cues, limiting their effectiveness in GCL scenarios. Moreover, existing methods often lack targeted design and fail to address two fundamental challenges in continual PET: how to allocate expert parameters to evolving data distributions, and how to improve their representational capacity under limited supervision. Inspired by the fruit fly's hierarchical memory system characterized by sparse expansion and modular ensembles, we propose FlyPrompt, a brain-inspired framework that decomposes GCL into two subproblems: expert routing and expert competence improvement. FlyPrompt introduces a randomly expanded analytic router for instance-level expert activation and a temporal ensemble of output heads to dynamically adapt decision boundaries over time. Extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate FlyPrompt's superior performance, achieving up to 11.23%, 12.43%, and 7.62% gains over state-of-the-art baselines on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200, respectively.

Existing models achieve strong per-frame accuracy but often flicker under motion, occlusion, and lighting changes, and they rarely have paired human video supervision for multiple dense tasks. We address this gap with a scalable synthetic data pipeline that generates photorealistic human frames and motion-aligned sequences with pixel-accurate depth, normals, and masks. Unlike prior static data synthetic pipelines, our pipeline provides both frame-level labels for spatial learning and sequence-level supervision for temporal learning. Building on this, we train a unified ViT-based dense predictor that (i) injects an explicit human geometric prior via CSE embeddings and (ii) improves geometry-feature reliability with a lightweight channel reweighting module after feature fusion. Our two-stage training strategy, combining static pretraining with dynamic sequence supervision, enables the model first to acquire robust spatial representations and then refine temporal consistency across motion-aligned sequences. Extensive experiments show that we achieve state-of-the-art performance on THuman2.1 and Hi4D and generalize effectively to in-the-wild videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodecSlime: Temporal Redundancy Compression of Neural Speech Codec via Dynamic Frame Rate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21074v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural speech codecs have been widely used in audio compression and various downstream tasks. Current mainstream codecs are fixed-frame-rate (FFR), which allocate the same number of tokens to every equal-duration slice. However, speech is inherently non-uniform in temporal information density. As a result, many tokens are wasted on steady-state segments like long vowels and silences. To address this mismatch, we present CodecSlime, a plugin-style method for compressing temporal redundancy through supporting dynamic frame rate (DFR) on neural speech codecs for the first time. Our method is unsupervised and architecture-agnostic, combining two key innovations, ScheDFR and Melt-and-Cool, for adapting inference and training, respectively. When integrated into a typical VQ-GAN codec backbone and operating at 40 Hz DFR ($\approx$ 600 bps), the reconstruction WER of CodecSlime is reduced by up to 32% relative to conventional FFR baselines with the same model architecture and similar bitrates, while other metrics are also competitive. CodecSlime also enables flexible trade-offs between reconstruction quality and bitrate: a single model supports inference at multiple frame rates and consistently outperforms FFR models at the corresponding frame rates.

The network architecture of CGSTAE combines two components: a correlation graph structure learning module based on spatial self-attention mechanism (SSAM) and a spatial-temporal encoder-decoder module utilizing graph convolutional long-short term memory (GCLSTM). The SSAM learns correlation graphs by capturing dynamic relationships between variables, while a novel three-step causal graph structure learning algorithm is introduced to derive a causal graph from these correlation graphs. The algorithm leverages a reverse perspective of causal invariance principle to uncover the invariant causal graph from varying correlations. The spatial-temporal encoder-decoder, built with GCLSTM units, reconstructs time-series process data within a sequence-to-sequence framework. The proposed CGSTAE enables effective process monitoring and fault detection through two statistics in the feature space and residual space. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of CGSTAE in process monitoring through the Tennessee Eastman process and a real-world air separation process.</p></details> |  |

We propose Video-OPD, an efficient post-training framework for TVG inspired by recent advances in on-policy distillation. Video-OPD optimizes trajectories sampled directly from the current policy, thereby preserving alignment between training and inference distributions, while a frontier teacher supplies dense, token-level supervision via a reverse KL divergence objective. This formulation preserves the on-policy property critical for mitigating distributional shift, while converting sparse, episode-level feedback into fine-grained, step-wise learning signals. Building on Video-OPD, we introduce Teacher-Validated Disagreement Focusing (TVDF), a lightweight training curriculum that iteratively prioritizes trajectories that are both teacher-reliable and maximally informative for the student, thereby improving training efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that Video-OPD consistently outperforms GRPO while achieving substantially faster convergence and lower computational cost, establishing on-policy distillation as an effective alternative to conventional reinforcement learning for TVG.</p></details> |  |

While vision-language models have advanced single-image report generation and visual grounding, no existing method combines these capabilities for temporal change detection. We introduce Temporal Radiology with Anatomical Change Explanation (TRACE), the first model that jointly performs temporal comparison, change classification, and spatial localization. Given a prior and current chest X-ray, TRACE generates natural language descriptions of interval changes (worsened, improved, stable) while grounding each finding with bounding box coordinates. TRACE demonstrates effective spatial localization with over 90% grounding accuracy, establishing a foundation for this challenging new task. Our ablation study uncovers an emergent capability: change detection arises only when temporal comparison and spatial grounding are jointly learned, as neither alone enables meaningful change detection. This finding suggests that grounding provides a spatial attention mechanism essential for temporal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weighted Temporal Decay Loss for Learning Wearable PPG Data with Sparse Clinical Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02917v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in wearable computing and AI have increased interest in leveraging PPG for health monitoring over the past decade. One of the biggest challenges in developing health algorithms based on such biosignals is the sparsity of clinical labels, which makes biosignals temporally distant from lab draws less reliable for supervision. To address this problem, we introduce a simple training strategy that learns a biomarker-specific decay of sample weight over the time gap between a segment and its ground truth label and uses this weight in the loss with a regularizer to prevent trivial solutions. On smartwatch PPG from 450 participants across 10 biomarkers, the approach improves over baselines. In the subject-wise setting, the proposed approach averages 0.715 AUPRC, compared to 0.674 for a fine-tuned self-supervised baseline and 0.626 for a feature-based Random Forest. A comparison of four decay families shows that a simple linear decay function is most robust on average. Beyond accuracy, the learned decay rates summarize how quickly each biomarker's PPG evidence becomes stale, providing an interpretable view of temporal sensitivity.</p></details> | ICASSP 2026 |

We propose Cross-Temporal Attention Fusion (CTAF), a self-supervised module that learns soft bidirectional alignments between modalities and builds a robust clip embedding using time-aware cross attention, a lightweight fusion gate, and alignment-regularized contrastive objectives with optional weak supervision. On the K-EmoCon dataset, under leave-one-out cross-validation evaluation, CTAF yields higher cosine margins for matched pairs and better cross-modal token retrieval within one second, and it is competitive with the baseline on three-bin accuracy and macro-F1 while using few labels. Our contributions are a time-aware fusion mechanism that directly models correspondence, an alignment-driven self-supervised objective tailored to EEG and physiology, and an evaluation protocol that measures alignment quality itself. Our approach accounts for the coupling between the central and autonomic nervous systems in psychophysiological time series. These results indicate that CTAF is a strong step toward label-efficient, generalizable EEG-peripheral fusion under temporal asynchrony.</p></details> |  |

This perspective neglects the temporal complexity in longitudinal datasets, such as electronic health records, where a user contributes an entire (sub) table of sequential events. While practitioners might attempt to model such data by flattening user histories into high-dimensional vectors for use with standard marginal-based mechanisms, we demonstrate that this strategy is insufficient. Flattening fails to preserve temporal coherence even when it maintains valid marginal distributions. We introduce PATH, a novel generative framework that treats the full table as the unit of synthesis and leverages the autoregressive capabilities of privately fine-tuned large language models. Extensive evaluations show that PATH effectively captures long-range dependencies that traditional methods miss. Empirically, our method reduces the distributional distance to real trajectories by over 60% and reduces state transition errors by nearly 50% compared to leading marginal mechanisms while achieving similar marginal fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Game-Time: Evaluating Temporal Dynamics in Spoken Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26388v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are emerging as a promising paradigm for real-time speech interaction. However, their capacity of temporal dynamics, including the ability to manage timing, tempo and simultaneous speaking, remains a critical and unevaluated challenge for conversational fluency. To address this gap, we introduce the Game-Time Benchmark, a framework to systematically assess these temporal capabilities. Inspired by how humans learn a language through language activities, Game-Time consists of basic instruction-following tasks and advanced tasks with temporal constraints, such as tempo adherence and synchronized responses. Our evaluation of diverse SLM architectures reveals a clear performance disparity: while state-of-the-art models handle basic tasks well, many contemporary systems still struggle with fundamental instruction-following. More critically, nearly all models degrade substantially under temporal constraints, exposing persistent weaknesses in time awareness and full-duplex interaction. The Game-Time Benchmark provides a foundation for guiding future research toward more temporally-aware conversational AI. Demos and datasets are available on our project website https://ga642381.github.io/Game-Time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a framework for counterfactual validation of TLP models by generating causal temporal interaction graphs (CTIGs) with known ground-truth causal structure. We first introduce a structural equation model for continuous-time event sequences that supports both excitatory and inhibitory effects, and then extend this mechanism to temporal interaction graphs. To compare causal models, we propose a distance metric based on cross-model predictive error, and empirically validate the hypothesis that predictors trained on one causal model degrade when evaluated on sufficiently distant models. Finally, we instantiate counterfactual evaluation under (i) controlled causal shifts between generating models and (ii) timestamp shuffling as a stochastic distortion with measurable causal distance. Our framework provides a foundation for causality-aware benchmarking.</p></details> |  |

Recent generative models have shown promise in accelerating simulations, yet they struggle with long-horizon generation due to architectural constraints, error accumulation, and inadequate modeling of spatio-temporal dynamics. We present STAR-MD (Spatio-Temporal Autoregressive Rollout for Molecular Dynamics), a scalable SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that generates physically plausible protein trajectories over microsecond timescales. Our key innovation is a causal diffusion transformer with joint spatio-temporal attention that efficiently captures complex space-time dependencies while avoiding the memory bottlenecks of existing methods. On the standard ATLAS benchmark, STAR-MD achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics--substantially improving conformational coverage, structural validity, and dynamic fidelity compared to previous methods. STAR-MD successfully extrapolates to generate stable microsecond-scale trajectories where baseline methods fail catastrophically, maintaining high structural quality throughout the extended rollout. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals severe limitations in current models for long-horizon generation, while demonstrating that STAR-MD's joint spatio-temporal modeling enables robust dynamics simulation at biologically relevant timescales, paving the way for accelerated exploration of protein function.</p></details> | <details><summary>For a...</summary><p>For associated project page, see https://bytedance-seed.github.io/ConfRover/starmd</p></details> |

Yet, training SNNs under fine temporal discretization remains a major challenge, hindering both low-latency responsiveness and the mapping of software-trained SNNs to efficient hardware. In current approaches, spiking neurons are modeled as self-recurrent units, embedded into recurrent networks to maintain state over time, and trained with BPTT or RTRL variants based on surrogate gradients. These methods scale poorly with temporal resolution, while online approximations often exhibit instability for long sequences and tend to fail at capturing temporal patterns precisely. To address these limitations, we develop spiking neurons with internal recursive memory structures that we combine with sigma-delta spike-coding. We show that this SpikingGamma model supports direct error backpropagation without surrogate gradients, can learn fine temporal patterns with minimal spiking in an online manner, and scale feedforward SNNs to complex tasks and benchmarks with competitive accuracy, all while being insensitive to the temporal resolution of the model. Our approach offers both an alternative to current recurrent SNNs trained with surrogate gradients, and a direct route for mapping SNNs to neuromorphic hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-LLM: Teaching Large Language Models to Forecast Time Series via Temporal Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01937v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making across many real-world applications. Unlike data in vision and language domains, time series data is inherently tied to the evolution of underlying processes and can only accumulate as real-world time progresses, limiting the effectiveness of scale-driven pretraining alone. This time-bound constraint poses a challenge for enabling large language models (LLMs) to acquire forecasting capability, as existing approaches primarily rely on representation-level alignment or inference-time temporal modules rather than explicitly teaching forecasting behavior to the LLM. We propose T-LLM, a temporal distillation framework that equips general-purpose LLMs with time series forecasting capability by transferring predictive behavior from a lightweight temporal teacher during training. The teacher combines trend modeling and frequency-domain analysis to provide structured temporal supervision, and is removed entirely at inference, leaving the LLM as the sole forecasting model. Experiments on benchmark datasets and infectious disease forecasting tasks demonstrate that T-LLM consistently outperforms existing LLM-based forecasting methods under full-shot, few-shot, and zero-shot settings, while enabling a simple and efficient deployment pipeline.</p></details> |  |

The complex spatio-temporal dependencies and nonlinear dynamics of urban mobility networks further complicate few-shot learning across different cities. This paper proposes MCPST, a novel Multi-phase Consensus Spatio-Temporal framework for few-shot traffic forecasting that reconceptualises traffic prediction as a multi-phase consensus learning problem. Our framework introduces three core innovations: (1) a multi-phase engine that models traffic dynamics through diffusion, synchronisation, and spectral embeddings for comprehensive dynamic characterisation; (2) an adaptive consensus mechanism that dynamically fuses phase-specific predictions while enforcing consistency; and (3) a structured meta-learning strategy for rapid adaptation to new cities with minimal data. We establish extensive theoretical guarantees, including representation theorems with bounded approximation errors and generalisation bounds for few-shot adaptation. Through experiments on four real-world datasets, MCPST outperforms fourteen state-of-the-art methods in spatio-temporal graph learning methods, dynamic graph transfer learning methods, prompt-based spatio-temporal prediction methods and cross-domain few-shot settings, improving prediction accuracy while reducing required training data and providing interpretable insights. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/afofanah/MCPST.</p></details> |  |
| **[WS-IMUBench: Can Weakly Supervised Methods from Audio, Image, and Video Be Adapted for IMU-based Temporal Action Localization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01850v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>IMU-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has enabled a wide range of ubiquitous computing applications, yet its dominant clip classification paradigm cannot capture the rich temporal structure of real-world behaviors. This motivates a shift toward IMU Temporal Action Localization (IMU-TAL), which predicts both action categories and their start/end times in continuous streams. However, current progress is strongly bottlenecked by the need for dense, frame-level boundary annotations, which are costly and difficult to scale. To address this bottleneck, we introduce WS-IMUBench, a systematic benchmark study of weakly supervised IMU-TAL (WS-IMU-TAL) under only sequence-level labels. Rather than proposing a new localization algorithm, we evaluate how well established weakly supervised localization paradigms from audio, image, and video transfer to IMU-TAL under only sequence-level labels. We benchmark seven representative weakly supervised methods on seven public IMU datasets, resulting in over 3,540 model training runs and 7,080 inference evaluations. Guided by three research questions on transferability, effectiveness, and insights, our findings show that (i) transfer is modality-dependent, with temporal-domain methods generally more stable than image-derived proposal-based approaches; (ii) weak supervision can be competitive on favorable datasets (e.g., with longer actions and higher-dimensional sensing); and (iii) dominant failure modes arise from short actions, temporal ambiguity, and proposal quality. Finally, we outline concrete directions for advancing WS-IMU-TAL (e.g., IMU-specific proposal generation, boundary-aware objectives, and stronger temporal reasoning). Beyond individual results, WS-IMUBench establishes a reproducible benchmarking template, datasets, protocols, and analyses, to accelerate community-wide progress toward scalable WS-IMU-TAL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review. 28 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Sharp Thresholds for Temporal Motifs and Doubling Time in Random Temporal Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01847v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we study two natural models of \textit{random temporal} graphs. In the first, the \textit{continuous} model, each edge $e$ is assigned $l_e$ labels, each drawn uniformly at random from $(0,1]$, where the numbers $l_e$ are independent random variables following the same discrete probability distribution. In the second, the \textit{discrete} model, the $l_e$ labels of each edge $e$ are chosen uniformly at random from a set $\{1,2,\ldots,T\}$. In both models we study the existence of \textit{$δ$-temporal motifs}. Here a $δ$-temporal motif consists of a pair $(H,P)$, where $H$ is a fixed static graph and $P$ is a partial order over its edges. A temporal graph $\mathcal{G}=(G,λ)$ contains $(H,P)$ as a $δ$-temporal motif if $\mathcal{G}$ has a simple temporal subgraph on the edges of $H$ whose time labels are ordered according to $P$, and whose life duration is at most $δ$. We prove \textit{sharp existence thresholds} for all $δ$-temporal motifs, and we identify a qualitatively different behavior from the analogous static thresholds in Erdos-Renyi random graphs. Applying the same techniques, we then characterize the growth of the largest $δ$-temporal clique in the continuous variant of our random temporal graphs model. Finally, we consider the \textit{doubling time} of the reachability ball centered on a small set of vertices of the random temporal graph as a natural proxy for temporal expansion. We prove \textit{sharp upper and lower bounds} for the maximum doubling time in the continuous model.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaST$_{0}$: Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought for Robotic Vision-Language-Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05248v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown strong generalization, with some approaches seeking to explicitly generate linguistic reasoning traces or predict future observations prior to execution. However, explicit reasoning typically incurs non-negligible inference latency, which constrains the temporal resolution required for robotic manipulation. Moreover, such reasoning is confined to the linguistic space, imposing a representational bottleneck that struggles to faithfully capture ineffable physical attributes. To mitigate these limitations, we propose LaST$_0$, a framework that enables efficient reasoning before acting through a Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought (CoT), capturing fine-grained physical and robotic dynamics that are often difficult to verbalize. Specifically, we introduce a token-efficient latent CoT space that models future visual dynamics, 3D structural information, and robot proprioceptive states, and further extends these representations across time to enable temporally consistent implicit reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, LaST$_0$ adopts a dual-system architecture implemented via a Mixture-of-Transformers design, where a reasoning expert conducts low-frequency latent inference and an acting expert generates high-frequency actions conditioned on robotics-oriented latent representations. To facilitate coordination, LaST$_0$ is trained with heterogeneous operation frequencies, enabling adaptive switching during deployment. Across 10 real-world tasks spanning tabletop, mobile, and dexterous hand manipulation, LaST$_0$ improves mean success rates by 13%, 14% and 14% over prior SOTA VLA methods, respectively.</p></details> |  |

The majority of existing placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models. In addition, we developed a novel GP inference method -- the Vanilla SPDE Exchange (VaSE) -- to boost the GP posterior sampling efficiency, which is also of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Autoregressive Video Diffusion and World Models with Temporal Cache Compression and Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01801v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive video diffusion models enable streaming generation, opening the door to long-form synthesis, video world models, and interactive neural game engines. However, their core attention layers become a major bottleneck at inference time: as generation progresses, the KV cache grows, causing both increasing latency and escalating GPU memory, which in turn restricts usable temporal context and harms long-range consistency. In this work, we study redundancy in autoregressive video diffusion and identify three persistent sources: near-duplicate cached keys across frames, slowly evolving (largely semantic) queries/keys that make many attention computations redundant, and cross-attention over long prompts where only a small subset of tokens matters per frame. Building on these observations, we propose a unified, training-free attention framework for autoregressive diffusion: TempCache compresses the KV cache via temporal correspondence to bound cache growth; AnnCA accelerates cross-attention by selecting frame-relevant prompt tokens using fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) matching; and AnnSA sparsifies self-attention by restricting each query to semantically matched keys, also using a lightweight ANN. Together, these modules reduce attention, compute, and memory and are compatible with existing autoregressive diffusion backbones and world models. Experiments demonstrate up to x5--x10 end-to-end speedups while preserving near-identical visual quality and, crucially, maintaining stable throughput and nearly constant peak GPU memory usage over long rollouts, where prior methods progressively slow down and suffer from increasing memory usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://dvirsamuel.github.io/fast-auto-regressive-video/</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Transformers for Long-Term NDVI Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01799v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term satellite image time series (SITS) analysis in heterogeneous landscapes faces significant challenges, particularly in Mediterranean regions where complex spatial patterns, seasonal variations, and multi-decade environmental changes interact across different scales. This paper presents the Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Long Term Forecasting (STT-LTF ), an extended framework that advances beyond purely temporal analysis to integrate spatial context modeling with temporal sequence prediction. STT-LTF processes multi-scale spatial patches alongside temporal sequences (up to 20 years) through a unified transformer architecture, capturing both local neighborhood relationships and regional climate influences. The framework employs comprehensive self-supervised learning with spatial masking, temporal masking, and horizon sampling strategies, enabling robust model training from 40 years of unlabeled Landsat imagery. Unlike autoregressive approaches, STT-LTF directly predicts arbitrary future time points without error accumulation, incorporating spatial patch embeddings, cyclical temporal encoding, and geographic coordinates to learn complex dependencies across heterogeneous Mediterranean ecosystems. Experimental evaluation on Landsat data (1984-2024) demonstrates that STT-LTF achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0328 and R^2 of 0.8412 for next-year predictions, outperforming traditional statistical methods, CNN-based approaches, LSTM networks, and standard transformers. The framework's ability to handle irregular temporal sampling and variable prediction horizons makes it particularly suitable for analysis of heterogeneous landscapes experiencing rapid ecological transitions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Backdoor Sentinel: Detecting and Detoxifying Backdoors in Diffusion Models via Temporal Noise Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01765v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have been widely deployed in AIGC services; however, their reliance on opaque training data and procedures exposes a broad attack surface for backdoor injection. In practical auditing scenarios, due to the protection of intellectual property and commercial confidentiality, auditors are typically unable to access model parameters, rendering existing white-box or query-intensive detection methods impractical. More importantly, even after the backdoor is detected, existing detoxification approaches are often trapped in a dilemma between detoxification effectiveness and generation quality. In this work, we identify a previously unreported phenomenon called temporal noise unconsistency, where the noise predictions between adjacent diffusion timesteps is disrupted in specific temporal segments when the input is triggered, while remaining stable under clean inputs. Leveraging this finding, we propose Temporal Noise Consistency Defense (TNC-Defense), a unified framework for backdoor detection and detoxification. The framework first uses the adjacent timestep noise consistency to design a gray-box detection module, for identifying and locating anomalous diffusion timesteps. Furthermore, the framework uses the identified anomalous timesteps to construct a trigger-agnostic, timestep-aware detoxification module, which directly corrects the backdoor generation path. This effectively suppresses backdoor behavior while significantly reducing detoxification costs. We evaluate the proposed method under five representative backdoor attack scenarios and compare it with state-of-the-art defenses. The results show that TNC-Defense improves the average detection accuracy by $11\%$ with negligible additional overhead, and invalidates an average of $98.5\%$ of triggered samples with only a mild degradation in generation quality.</p></details> |  |

However, this does not imply that the distinction between real and cutting-edge high-fidelity fake is untraceable. We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter. By analyzing the structured MPF that persists even in visually perfect sequences, our framework ensures that forgeries are exposed regardless of whether they manifest as global real-world manifold deviations or subtle computational fingerprints.</p></details> |  |

This paper provides a principled analysis and improvement of this technique. First, we offer a theoretical basis for its effectiveness, explaining the error variance reduction for fundamental frequency estimation and invoking Condorcet's jury theorem for voiced/unvoiced detection accuracy. To address its practical limitations, we propose two key improvements: 1) a pre-voting alignment procedure to correct temporal and frequential biases among estimators, and 2) a greedy algorithm to select a compact yet effective subset of estimators based on error correlation. Experiments on a diverse dataset of speech, singing, and music show that our proposed method with alignment outperforms individual state-of-the-art estimators in clean conditions and maintains robust voiced/unvoiced detection in noisy environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

Thus, numerous methods are proposed to introduce temporal cues to enhance tracking robustness. However, conventional CNN and Transformer architectures exhibit inherent limitations in modeling long-range temporal dependencies in visual tracking, often necessitating either complex customized modules or substantial computational costs to integrate temporal cues. Inspired by the success of the state space model, we propose a novel temporal modeling paradigm for visual tracking, termed State-aware Mamba Tracker (SMTrack), providing a neat pipeline for training and tracking without needing customized modules or substantial computational costs to build long-range temporal dependencies. It enjoys several merits. First, we propose a novel selective state-aware space model with state-wise parameters to capture more diverse temporal cues for robust tracking. Second, SMTrack facilitates long-range temporal interactions with linear computational complexity during training. Third, SMTrack enables each frame to interact with previously tracked frames via hidden state propagation and updating, which releases computational costs of handling temporal cues during tracking. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SMTrack achieves promising performance with low computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by IEEE TIP</p></details> |

However, we can't manage what we can't measure. Accurately quantifying the pools and fluxes in the carbon, nutrient, and water nexus of the agroecosystem is therefore essential for understanding the underlying drivers of GHG and developing effective mitigation strategies. Conventional approaches like soil sampling, process-based models, and black-box machine learning models are facing challenges such as data sparsity, high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and complex subsurface biogeochemical and physical processes. Developing new trustworthy approaches such as AI-empowered models, will require the AI-ready benchmark dataset and outlined protocols, which unfortunately do not exist. In this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind spatial-temporal agroecosystem GHG benchmark dataset that integrates physics-based model simulations from Ecosys and DayCent with real-world observations from eddy covariance flux towers and controlled-environment facilities. We evaluate the performance of various sequential deep learning models on carbon and nitrogen flux prediction, including LSTM-based models, temporal CNN-based model, and Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we explored transfer learning to leverage simulated data to improve the generalization of deep learning models on real-world observations. Our benchmark dataset and evaluation framework contribute to the development of more accurate and scalable AI-driven agroecosystem models, advancing our understanding of ecosystem-climate interactions.</p></details> |  |

They term this convergence as NeuroAI. Previous research has established temporal neural networks (TNNs) as a promising neuromorphic approach toward biological intelligence and efficiency. We fully embrace NeuroAI and propose a new category of TNNs we call NeuroAI TNNs (NeuTNNs) with greater capability and hardware efficiency by adopting neuroscience findings, including a neuron model with active dendrites and a hierarchy of distal and proximal segments. This work introduces a PyTorch-to-layout tool suite (NeuTNNGen) to design application-specific NeuTNNs. Compared to previous TNN designs, NeuTNNs achieve superior performance and efficiency. We demonstrate NeuTNNGen's capabilities using three example applications: 1) UCR time series benchmarks, 2) MNIST design exploration, and 3) Place Cells design for neocortical reference frames. We also explore using synaptic pruning to further reduce synapse counts and hardware costs by 30-50% while maintaining model precision across diverse sensory modalities. NeuTNNGen can facilitate the design of application-specific energy-efficient NeuTNNs for the next generation of NeuroAI computing systems.</p></details> |  |

Yet, most existing methods treat workload scheduling and regulation capacity bidding separately, overlooking how queueing dynamics and spatial-temporal dispatch decisions affect the ability to sustain real-time regulation. As a result, the committed regulation may become infeasible or short-lived. To address this issue, we propose a unified day-ahead co-optimization framework that jointly decides workload distribution across geographically distributed DCs and regulation capacity commitments. We construct a space-time network model to capture workload migration costs, latency requirements, and heterogeneous resource limits. To ensure that the committed regulation remains deliverable, we introduce chance constraints on instantaneous power flexibility based on interactive load forecasts, and apply Value-at-Risk queue-state constraints to maintain sustainable response under cumulative regulation signals. Case studies on a modified IEEE 68-bus system using real data center traces show that the proposed framework lowers system operating costs, enables more viable regulation capacity, and achieves better revenue-risk trade-offs compared to strategies that optimize scheduling and regulation independently.</p></details> |  |

Existing causal discovery methods typically operate on raw observations, making them vulnerable to spurious edges and misattributed temporal dependencies. We introduce a decomposition-based causal discovery framework that separates each time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components and performs component-specific causal analysis. Trend components are assessed using stationarity tests, seasonal components using kernel-based dependence measures, and residual components using constraint-based causal discovery. The resulting component-level graphs are integrated into a unified multi-scale causal structure. This approach isolates long- and short-range causal effects, reduces spurious associations, and improves interpretability. Across extensive synthetic benchmarks and real-world climate data, our framework more accurately recovers ground-truth causal structure than state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under strong non-stationarity and temporal autocorrelation.</p></details> |  |

We address the strongly NP-hard problem $P2|r_j|C_{\max}$ through an innovative adaptive temporal discretization methodology that achieves exponential complexity reduction from $O(T^n)$ to $O(B^n)$ where $B \ll T$, while maintaining near-optimal solution quality. Our bucket-indexed mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation exploits dimensional complexity heterogeneity through precision-aware discretization, reducing decision variables by 94.4\% and achieving a theoretical speedup factor $2.75 \times 10^{37}$ for 20-job instances. Theoretical contributions include partial discretization theory, fractional bucket calculus operators, and quantum-inspired mechanisms for temporal constraint modeling. Empirical validation on instances with 20--400 jobs demonstrates 97.6\% resource utilization, near-perfect load balancing ($σ/μ= 0.006$), and sustained performance across problem scales with optimality gaps below 5.1\%. This work represents a paradigm shift from fine-grained temporal discretization to multi-resolution precision allocation, bridging the fundamental gap between exact optimization and computational tractability for industrial-scale NP-hard scheduling problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaST: Causal Discovery via Spatio-Temporal Graphs in Disaster Tweets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02601v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding causality between real-world events from social media is essential for situational awareness, yet existing causal discovery methods often overlook the interplay between semantic, spatial, and temporal contexts. We propose CaST: Causal Discovery via Spatio-Temporal Graphs, a unified framework for causal discovery in disaster domain that integrates semantic similarity and spatio-temporal proximity using Large Language Models (LLMs) pretrained on disaster datasets. CaST constructs an event graph for each window of tweets. Each event extracted from tweets is represented as a node embedding enriched with its contextual semantics, geographic coordinates, and temporal features. These event nodes are then connected to form a spatio-temporal event graph, which is processed using a multi-head Graph Attention Network (GAT) \cite{gat} to learn directed causal relationships. We construct an in-house dataset of approximately 167K disaster-related tweets collected during Hurricane Harvey and annotated following the MAVEN-ERE schema. Experimental results show that CaST achieves superior performance over both traditional and state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies further confirm that incorporating spatial and temporal signals substantially improves both recall and stability during training. Overall, CaST demonstrates that integrating spatio-temporal reasoning into event graphs enables more robust and interpretable causal discovery in disaster-related social media text.</p></details> |  |

For continuous Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), achieving higher compression rates is desirable; yet, the efficiency notably declines when extra sampling layers are added without expanding the dimensions of hidden channels. In this paper, we present a technique to convert fixed compression rate VAEs into models that support multi-level temporal compression, providing a straightforward and minimal fine-tuning approach to counteract performance decline at elevated compression rates.Moreover, we examine how varying compression levels impact model performance over video segments with diverse characteristics, offering empirical evidence on the effectiveness of our proposed approach. We also investigate the integration of our multi-level temporal compression VAE with diffusion-based generative models, DiT, highlighting successful concurrent training and compatibility within these frameworks. This investigation illustrates the potential uses of multi-level temporal compression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Point-supervised Temporal Action Localization via Text Refinement and Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01257v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, point-supervised temporal action localization has gained significant attention for its effective balance between labeling costs and localization accuracy. However, current methods only consider features from visual inputs, neglecting helpful semantic information from the text side. To address this issue, we propose a Text Refinement and Alignment (TRA) framework that effectively utilizes textual features from visual descriptions to complement the visual features as they are semantically rich. This is achieved by designing two new modules for the original point-supervised framework: a Point-based Text Refinement module (PTR) and a Point-based Multimodal Alignment module (PMA). Specifically, we first generate descriptions for video frames using a pre-trained multimodal model. Next, PTR refines the initial descriptions by leveraging point annotations together with multiple pre-trained models. PMA then projects all features into a unified semantic space and leverages a point-level multimodal feature contrastive learning to reduce the gap between visual and linguistic modalities. Last, the enhanced multi-modal features are fed into the action detector for precise localization. Extensive experimental results on five widely used benchmarks demonstrate the favorable performance of our proposed framework compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our computational overhead analysis shows that the framework can run on a single 24 GB RTX 3090 GPU, indicating its practicality and scalability.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages a 4-dimensional spatio-temporal planner, integrated with vision-based Safe Flight Corridor (SFC) generation and trajectory optimization. Unlike prior methods that rely on map fusion, our framework is mapless, enabling collision avoidance directly from perception while reducing computational overhead. Dynamic obstacles are detected and tracked using a vision-based object segmentation and tracking pipeline, allowing robust classification of static versus dynamic elements in the scene. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a backup planning module that reactively avoids dynamic obstacles when no direct path to the goal is available, mitigating the risk of collisions during deadlock situations. We validate our method extensively in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments, and benchmark it against state-of-the-art approaches, showing significant advantages for reactive UAV navigation in dynamic, unknown environments.</p></details> |  |

Maps of Dynamics (MoDs) provide such models by encoding statistical motion patterns in a map, but existing representations use discrete spatial sampling and typically require costly offline construction. We propose a continuous spatio-temporal MoD representation based on implicit neural functions that directly map coordinates to the parameters of a Semi-Wrapped Gaussian Mixture Model. This removes the need for discretization and imputation for unevenly sampled regions, enabling smooth generalization across both space and time. Evaluated on two public datasets with real-world people tracking data, our method achieves better accuracy of motion representation and smoother velocity distributions in sparse regions while still being computationally efficient, compared to available baselines. The proposed approach demonstrates a powerful and efficient way of modeling complex human motion patterns and high performance in the trajectory prediction downstream task.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, TLDiffGAN, which consists of two complementary branches. One branch incorporates a latent diffusion model into the GAN generator for adversarial training, thereby making the discriminator's task more challenging and improving the quality of generated samples. The other branch leverages pretrained audio model encoders to extract features directly from raw audio waveforms for auxiliary discrimination. This framework effectively captures feature representations of normal sounds from both raw audio and Mel spectrograms. Moreover, we introduce a TMixup spectrogram augmentation technique to enhance sensitivity to subtle and localized temporal patterns that are often overlooked. Extensive experiments on the DCASE 2020 Challenge Task 2 dataset demonstrate the superior detection performance of TLDiffGAN, as well as its strong capability in anomalous time-frequency localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

We show this approach is unreliable: auditing Google Search with a before: filter, 71% of questions return at least one page containing strong post-cutoff leakage, and for 41%, at least one page directly reveals the answer. Using a large language model (LLM), gpt-oss-120b, to forecast with these leaky documents, we demonstrate an inflated prediction accuracy (Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.242 with leak-free documents). We characterize common leakage mechanisms, including updated articles, related-content modules, unreliable metadata/timestamps, and absence-based signals, and argue that date-restricted search is insufficient for temporal evaluation. We recommend stronger retrieval safeguards or evaluation on frozen, time-stamped web snapshots to ensure credible retrospective forecasting.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Addressing the limitations of existing methods, the work presents a five-fold contribution: (1) an automatic annotation framework that utilizes large vision-language models and a noise-robust contrastive learning objective with a subtractive angular margin; (2) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy using "recurrent adapters" to capture temporal dynamics in low-data regimes; (3) the integration of State Space Layers (SSL) for efficient long-form video modeling, supported by the introduction of two new long-term benchmarks for egocentric and feature-length content; (4) a novel contrastive learning framework designed to explicitly model fine-grained relations between motions and video moments; and (5) a comprehensive empirical study on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) that identifies the visual-language interface as a bottleneck for temporal reasoning, leading to a new "temporal-oriented recipe" for upscaled video understanding. Collectively, these contributions demonstrate that explicit temporal modeling significantly enhances a model's ability to represent and reason about the fluid nature of video content.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis, NUS, 2025</p></details> |

Although many models incorporate time through encodings or architectural design, they often compute attention over entangled node and edge representations, failing to reflect their distinct temporal behaviors. Node embeddings evolve slowly as they aggregate long-term structural context, while edge features reflect transient, timestamped interactions (e.g. messages, trades, or transactions). This mismatch results in semantic attention blurring, where attention weights cannot distinguish between slowly drifting node states and rapidly changing, information-rich edge interactions. As a result, models struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies and provide limited transparency into how temporal relevance is computed. This paper introduces KEAT (Kernelized Edge Attention for Temporal Graphs), a novel attention formulation that modulates edge features using a family of continuous-time kernels, including Laplacian, RBF, and learnable MLP variant. KEAT preserves the distinct roles of nodes and edges, and integrates seamlessly with both Transformer-style (e.g., DyGFormer) and message-passing (e.g., TGN) architectures. It achieves up to 18% MRR improvement over the recent DyGFormer and 7% over TGN on link prediction tasks, enabling more accurate, interpretable and temporally aware message passing in TGNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Recently, diffusion-based models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for remote sensing cloud removal due to their strong generative capability and stable optimization. However, existing diffusion-based approaches often suffer from limited sampling efficiency and insufficient exploitation of structural and temporal priors in multi-temporal remote sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose SADER, a structure-aware diffusion framework for multi-temporal remote sensing cloud removal. SADER first develops a scalable Multi-Temporal Conditional Diffusion Network (MTCDN) to fully capture multi-temporal and multimodal correlations via temporal fusion and hybrid attention. Then, a cloud-aware attention loss is introduced to emphasize cloud-dominated regions by accounting for cloud thickness and brightness discrepancies. In addition, a deterministic resampling strategy is designed for continuous diffusion models to iteratively refine samples under fixed sampling steps by replacing outliers through guided correction. Extensive experiments on multiple multi-temporal datasets demonstrate that SADER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art cloud removal methods across all evaluation metrics. The code of SADER is publicly available at https://github.com/zyfzs0/SADER.</p></details> |  |

However, optimizing control decisions subject to these constraints is often computationally expensive. This article presents a method that uses reachability analysis to implicitly express the set of states satisfying an MTL specification and then optimizes to find a motion plan. The hybrid zonotope set representation is used to efficiently and conveniently encode MTL specifications into reachable sets. A numerical benchmark highlights the proposed method's computational advantages as compared to existing methods in the literature. Further numerical examples and an experimental application demonstrate the ability to address time-varying environments, region-dependent disturbances, and multi-agent coordination.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeBlind: A Spatio-Temporal Compositionality Benchmark for Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00288v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding is essential for video reasoning and embodied AI. Yet, while Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) master static semantics, their grasp of temporal dynamics remains brittle. We present TimeBlind, a diagnostic benchmark for compositional spatio-temporal understanding. Inspired by cognitive science, TimeBlind categorizes fine-grained temporal understanding into three levels: recognizing atomic events, characterizing event properties, and reasoning about event interdependencies. Unlike benchmarks that conflate recognition with temporal reasoning, TimeBlind leverages a minimal-pairs paradigm: video pairs share identical static visual content but differ solely in temporal structure, utilizing complementary questions to neutralize language priors. Evaluating over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro) on 600 curated instances (2400 video-question pairs), reveals that the Instance Accuracy (correctly distinguishing both videos in a pair) of the best performing MLLM is only 48.2%, far below the human performance (98.2%). These results demonstrate that even frontier models rely heavily on static visual shortcuts rather than genuine temporal logic, positioning TimeBlind as a vital diagnostic tool for next-generation video understanding.

| **[Sequence Diffusion Model for Temporal Link Prediction in Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23233v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a fundamental problem in many real-world systems. Existing temporal graph neural networks mainly focus on learning representations of historical interactions. Despite their strong performance, these models are still purely discriminative, producing point estimates for future links and lacking an explicit mechanism to capture the uncertainty and sequential structure of future temporal interactions. In this paper, we propose SDG, a novel sequence-level diffusion framework that unifies dynamic graph learning with generative denoising. Specifically, SDG injects noise into the entire historical interaction sequence and jointly reconstructs all interaction embeddings through a conditional denoising process, thereby enabling the model to capture more comprehensive interaction distributions. To align the generative process with temporal link prediction, we employ a cross-attention denoising decoder to guide the reconstruction of the destination sequence and optimize the model in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on various temporal graph benchmarks show that SDG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the temporal link prediction task.</p></details> |  |

However, IoT systems are vulnerable to clock drift, time-synchronization manipulation, and timestamp discontinuities, such as the Year 2038 (Y2K38) Unix overflow, all of which disrupt temporal ordering. Conventional anomaly-detection models, which assume reliable timestamps, fail to capture temporal inconsistencies. This paper introduces STGAT (Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network), a framework that models both temporal distortion and inter-device consistency in energy IoT systems. STGAT combines drift-aware temporal embeddings and temporal self-attention to capture corrupted time evolution at individual devices, and uses graph attention to model spatial propagation of timing errors. A curvature-regularized latent representation geometrically separates normal clock evolution from anomalies caused by drift, synchronization offsets, and overflow events. Experimental results on energy IoT telemetry with controlled timing perturbations show that STGAT achieves 95.7% accuracy, outperforming recurrent, transformer, and graph-based baselines with significant improvements (d > 1.8, p < 0.001). Additionally, STGAT reduces detection delay by 26%, achieving a 2.3-time-step delay while maintaining stable performance under overflow, drift, and physical inconsistencies.</p></details> |  |

Temporal Patterns and Predictors of Newcomer-to-Core Transitions in Conventional OSS and OSS4SG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23142v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open Source Software (OSS) sustainability relies on newcomers transitioning to core contributors, but this pipeline is broken, with most newcomers becoming inactive after initial contributions. Open Source Software for Social Good (OSS4SG) projects, which prioritize societal impact as their primary mission, may be associated with different newcomer-to-core transition outcomes than conventional OSS projects. We compared 375 projects (190 OSS4SG, 185 OSS), analyzing 92,721 contributors and 3.5 million commits. OSS4SG projects retain contributors at 2.2X higher rates and contributors have 19.6% higher probability of achieving core status. Early broad project exploration predicts core achievement (22.2% importance); conventional OSS concentrates on one dominant pathway (61.62% of transitions) while OSS4SG provides multiple pathways. Contrary to intuition, contributors who invest time learning the project before intensifying their contributions (Late Spike pattern) achieve core status 2.4-2.9X faster (21 weeks) than those who contribute intensively from day one (Early Spike pattern, 51-60 weeks). OSS4SG supports two effective temporal patterns while only Late Spike achieves fastest time-to-core in conventional OSS. Our findings suggest that finding a project aligned with personal values and taking time to understand the codebase before major contributions are key strategies for achieving core status. Our findings show that project mission is associated with measurably different environments for newcomer-to-core transitions and provide evidence-based guidance for newcomers and maintainers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally Coherent Imitation Learning via Latent Action Flow Matching for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23087v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning long-horizon robotic manipulation requires jointly achieving expressive behavior modeling, real-time inference, and stable execution, which remains challenging for existing generative policies. Diffusion-based approaches provide strong modeling capacity but typically incur high inference latency, while flow matching enables fast one-step generation yet often leads to unstable execution when applied directly in the raw action space. We propose LG-Flow Policy, a trajectory-level imitation learning framework that performs flow matching in a continuous latent action space. By encoding action sequences into temporally regularized latent trajectories and learning an explicit latent-space flow, the proposed approach decouples global motion structure from low-level control noise, resulting in smooth and reliable long-horizon execution. LG-Flow Policy further incorporates geometry-aware point cloud conditioning and execution-time multimodal modulation, with visual cues evaluated as a representative modality in real-world settings. Experimental results in simulation and on physical robot platforms demonstrate that LG-Flow Policy achieves near single-step inference, substantially improves trajectory smoothness and task success over flow-based baselines operating in the raw action space, and remains significantly more efficient than diffusion-based policies.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

While existing normalization layers, BatchNorm, LayerNorm and InstanceNorm, help mitigate distribution shifts, when applied over the time dimension they ignore the dependencies and auto-correlation inherent to the vector coefficients they normalize. In this paper, we propose PSDNorm that leverages Monge mapping and temporal context to normalize feature maps in deep learning models for signals. Evaluations with architectures based on U-Net or transformer backbones trained on 10K subjects across 10 datasets, show that PSDNorm achieves state-of-the-art performance on unseen left-out datasets while being more robust to data scarcity.</p></details> |  |

While a substantial body of work has established its convergence and stability properties, more recent efforts have focused on its statistical efficiency through finite-time error bounds. In this paper, we advance this line of research by developing a new finite-time error analysis for tabular TD learning that directly exploits a discrete-time stochastic linear system representation and leverages Schur stability of the associated matrices. Beyond the specific bounds obtained, the proposed framework provides a reusable template for analyzing TD learning and related RL algorithms, and it offers control-theoretic insights that may guide future developments in finite-sample RL theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2112.14417</p></details> |

However, they suffer from catastrophic memory forgetting over long sequences due to balancing historical information with new observations. Recent methods alleviate this by deriving adaptive signals from attention perspective, but they operate on single dimensions without considering temporal and spatial consistency. To this end, we propose a training-free framework termed TTSA3R that leverages both temporal state evolution and spatial observation quality for adaptive state updates in 3D reconstruction. In particular, we devise a Temporal Adaptive Update Module that regulates update magnitude by analyzing temporal state evolution patterns. Then, a Spatial Contextual Update Module is introduced to localize spatial regions that require updates through observation-state alignment and scene dynamics. These complementary signals are finally fused to determine the state updating strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TTSA3R in diverse 3D tasks. Moreover, our method exhibits only 15% error increase compared to over 200% degradation in baseline models on extended sequences, significantly improving long-term reconstruction stability. Our codes will be available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Graph Pattern Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22454v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graph learning is pivotal for deciphering dynamic systems, where the core challenge lies in explicitly modeling the underlying evolving patterns that govern network transformation. However, prevailing methods are predominantly task-centric and rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as short-term dependency modeling, static neighborhood semantics, and retrospective time usage. These constraints hinder the discovery of transferable temporal evolution mechanisms. To address this, we propose the Temporal Graph Pattern Machine (TGPM), a foundation framework that shifts the focus toward directly learning generalized evolving patterns. TGPM conceptualizes each interaction as an interaction patch synthesized via temporally-biased random walks, thereby capturing multi-scale structural semantics and long-range dependencies that extend beyond immediate neighborhoods. These patches are processed by a Transformer-based backbone designed to capture global temporal regularities while adapting to context-specific interaction dynamics. To further empower the model, we introduce a suite of self-supervised pre-training tasks -- specifically masked token modeling and next-time prediction -- to explicitly encode the fundamental laws of network evolution. Extensive experiments show that TGPM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both transductive and inductive link prediction, demonstrating exceptional cross-domain transferability.</p></details> |  |

These approaches suffer from coordination overhead that scales poorly with agent count and task complexity. We propose a fundamentally different paradigm inspired by natural coordination mechanisms: agents operate locally on a shared artifact, guided only by pressure gradients derived from measurable quality signals, with temporal decay preventing premature convergence. We formalize this as optimization over a pressure landscape and prove convergence guarantees under mild conditions. Empirically, on meeting room scheduling across 1,350 trials, pressure-field coordination outperforms all baselines: 48.5% aggregate solve rate versus 12.6% for conversation-based coordination, 1.5% for hierarchical control, and 0.4% for sequential and random baselines (all pairwise comparisons p < 0.001). Temporal decay is essential: disabling it reduces solve rate by 10 percentage points. On easy problems, pressure-field achieves 86.7% solve rate. The approach maintains consistent performance from 1 to 4 agents. Implicit coordination through shared pressure gradients outperforms explicit hierarchical control, suggesting that constraint-driven emergence offers a simpler and more effective foundation for multi-agent AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages, 5 figures, 12 tables.

Existing LLM-based reasoning methods prioritize contextual over structural relations, struggling to extract relevant subgraphs from dynamic graphs. This limits structural information understanding, leading to unstructured, hallucination-prone inferences especially with temporal inconsistencies. To address this problem, we propose IGETR (Integration of Graph and Editing-enhanced Temporal Reasoning), a hybrid reasoning framework that combines the structured temporal modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the contextual understanding of LLMs. IGETR operates through a three-stage pipeline. The first stage aims to ground the reasoning process in the actual data by identifying structurally and temporally coherent candidate paths through a temporal GNN, ensuring that inference starts from reliable graph-based evidence. The second stage introduces LLM-guided path editing to address logical and semantic inconsistencies, leveraging external knowledge to refine and enhance the initial paths. The final stage focuses on integrating the refined reasoning paths to produce predictions that are both accurate and interpretable. Experiments on standard TKG benchmarks show that IGETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines with relative improvements of up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on the challenging ICEWS datasets. Additionally, we execute ablation studies and additional analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> |  |

We achieve this by using a sliding time window with short strides and consider the temporal dimension by storing convolution results between passes. This allows us to ignore unchanged regions, significantly reducing the number of convolution operations per forward pass without sacrificing accuracy. This data reuse scheme introduces extreme sparsity to detection data. To exploit this sparsity, we extend our previous work on scatter-based convolutions to allow for data reuse, and as such propose Sparse Scatter-Based Convolution Algorithm with Temporal Data Recycling (SSCATeR). This operation treats incoming LiDAR data as a continuous stream and acts only on the changing parts of the point cloud. By doing so, we achieve the same results with as much as a 6.61-fold reduction in processing time. Our test results show that the feature maps output by our method are identical to those produced by traditional sparse convolution techniques, whilst greatly increasing the computational efficiency of the network.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages, 27 Figures, This work has been accepted for publication by the IEEE Sensors Journal.

| **[Temporal Sepsis Modeling: a Fully Interpretable Relational Way](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21747v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sepsis remains one of the most complex and heterogeneous syndromes in intensive care, characterized by diverse physiological trajectories and variable responses to treatment. While deep learning models perform well in the early prediction of sepsis, they often lack interpretability and ignore latent patient sub-phenotypes. In this work, we propose a machine learning framework by opening up a new avenue for addressing this issue: a relational approach. Temporal data from electronic medical records (EMRs) are viewed as multivariate patient logs and represented in a relational data schema. Then, a propositionalisation technique (based on classic aggregation/selection functions from the field of relational data) is applied to construct interpretable features to "flatten" the data. Finally, the flattened data is classified using a selective naive Bayesian classifier. Experimental validation demonstrates the relevance of the suggested approach as well as its extreme interpretability. The interpretation is fourfold: univariate, global, local, and counterfactual.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Guidance for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21744v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Decoding (CD) enhances the generation quality of large language models (LLMs) but incurs significant additional computational overhead due to the need for an auxiliary model. Existing internal self-contrastive decoding methods, such as Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), focus on discrepancies across different layers, which are notably unstable on small-scale models. In this work, based on the observation that LLMs exhibit local preferences, we propose a novel contrastive guidance strategy along the temporal dimension, namely Temporal Guidance (TeGu). Our method ingeniously leverages Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) to construct weaker amateur predictions for model self-contrast. To standardize the implementation of this mechanism, we further introduce a lightweight Conditional MTP Projector (cMTPP), which avoids maintaining multiple independent networks as required by other MTP modules. Across various model series and benchmarks, TeGu achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining low additional memory consumption and computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Attention Patterns Exist: A Unifying Temporal Perspective Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21709v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention patterns play a crucial role in both training and inference of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have identified individual patterns such as retrieval heads, sink heads, and diagonal traces, yet these observations remain fragmented and lack a unifying explanation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Temporal Attention Pattern Predictability Analysis (TAPPA), a unifying framework that explains diverse attention patterns by analyzing their underlying mathematical formulations} from a temporally continuous perspective. TAPPA both deepens the understanding of attention behavior and guides inference acceleration approaches. Specifically, TAPPA characterizes attention patterns as predictable patterns with clear regularities and unpredictable patterns that appear effectively random. Our analysis further reveals that this distinction can be explained by the degree of query self-similarity along the temporal dimension. Focusing on the predictable patterns, we further provide a detailed mathematical analysis of three representative cases through the joint effect of queries, keys, and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We validate TAPPA by applying its insights to KV cache compression and LLM pruning tasks. Across these tasks, a simple metric motivated by TAPPA consistently improves performance over baseline methods.

| **[Mining Forgery Traces from Reconstruction Error: A Weakly Supervised Framework for Multimodal Deepfake Temporal Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21458v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern deepfakes have evolved into localized and intermittent manipulations that require fine-grained temporal localization. The prohibitive cost of frame-level annotation makes weakly supervised methods a practical necessity, which rely only on video-level labels. To this end, we propose Reconstruction-based Temporal Deepfake Localization (RT-DeepLoc), a weakly supervised temporal forgery localization framework that identifies forgeries via reconstruction errors. Our framework uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained exclusively on authentic data to learn its intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns; this allows the model to produce significant reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments, effectively providing the missing fine-grained cues for localization. To robustly leverage these indicators, we introduce a novel Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss (AICL). By focusing on the compactness of authentic features guided by these reconstruction cues, AICL establishes a stable decision boundary that enhances local discrimination while preserving generalization to unseen forgeries. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including LAV-DF, demonstrate that RT-DeepLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiHateLoc: Towards Temporal Localisation of Multimodal Hate Content in Online Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10408v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of video content on platforms such as TikTok and YouTube has intensified the spread of multimodal hate speech, where harmful cues emerge subtly and asynchronously across visual, acoustic, and textual streams. Existing research primarily focuses on video-level classification, leaving the practically crucial task of temporal localisation, identifying when hateful segments occur, largely unaddressed. This challenge is even more noticeable under weak supervision, where only video-level labels are available, and static fusion or classification-based architectures struggle to capture cross-modal and temporal dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose MultiHateLoc, the first framework designed for weakly-supervised multimodal hate localisation. MultiHateLoc incorporates (1) modality-aware temporal encoders to model heterogeneous sequential patterns, including a tailored text-based preprocessing module for feature enhancement; (2) dynamic cross-modal fusion to adaptively emphasise the most informative modality at each moment and a cross-modal contrastive alignment strategy to enhance multimodal feature consistency; (3) a modality-aware MIL objective to identify discriminative segments under video-level supervision. Despite relying solely on coarse labels, MultiHateLoc produces fine-grained, interpretable frame-level predictions. Experiments on HateMM and MultiHateClip show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the localisation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2026 (WWW 2026)</p></details> |
| **[MMGRid: Navigating Temporal-aware and Cross-domain Generative Recommendation via Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15930v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging (MM) offers an efficient mechanism for integrating multiple specialized models without access to original training data or costly retraining. While MM has demonstrated success in domains like computer vision, its role in recommender systems (RSs) remains largely unexplored. Recently, Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in RSs, characterized by rapidly growing model scales and substantial computational costs, making MM particularly appealing for cost-sensitive deployment scenarios. In this work, we present the first systematic study of MM in GR through a contextual lens. We focus on a fundamental yet underexplored challenge in real-world: how to merge generative recommenders specialized to different real-world contexts, arising from temporal evolving user behaviors and heterogeneous application domains. To this end, we propose a unified framework MMGRid, a structured contextual grid of GR checkpoints that organizes models trained under diverse contexts induced by temporal evolution and domain diversity. All checkpoints are derived from a shared base LLM but fine-tuned on context-specific data, forming a realistic and controlled model space for systematically analyzing MM across GR paradigms and merging algorithms. Our investigation reveals several key insights. First, training GR models from LLMs can introduce parameter conflicts during merging due to token distribution shifts and objective disparities; such conflicts can be alleviated by disentangling task-aware and context-specific parameter changes via base model replacement. Second, incremental training across contexts induces recency bias, which can be effectively balanced through weighted contextual merging. Notably, we observe that optimal merging weights correlate with context-dependent interaction characteristics, offering practical guidance for weight selection in real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Joinn99/MMGRid</p></details> |

However, its signals are high dimensional and noisy, hindering interpretation. We investigate compact representations of spatiotemporal articulatory dynamics for phoneme recognition from midsagittal vocal tract rtMRI videos. We compare three feature types: (1) raw video, (2) optical flow, and (3) six linguistically-relevant regions of interest (ROIs) for articulator movements. We evaluate models trained independently on each representation, as well as multi-feature combinations. Results show that multi-feature models consistently outperform single-feature baselines, with the lowest phoneme error rate (PER) of 0.34 obtained by combining ROI and raw video. Temporal fidelity experiments demonstrate a reliance on fine-grained articulatory dynamics, while ROI ablation studies reveal strong contributions from tongue and lips. Our findings highlight how rtMRI-derived features provide accuracy and interpretability, and establish strategies for leveraging articulatory data in speech processing.</p></details> |  |

Using the HBN movie-watching dataset, we benchmark five architectures, CNN, LSTM, a stabilized Transformer (EEGXF), S4, and S5, on a 4-class task across segment lengths from 8s to 128s. Accuracy improves with longer context: at 64s, S5 reaches 98.7%+/-0.6 and CNN 98.3%+/-0.3, while S5 uses ~20x fewer parameters than CNN. To probe real-world robustness, we evaluate zero-shot cross-frequency shifts, cross-task OOD inputs, and leave-one-subject-out generalization. S5 achieves stronger cross-subject accuracy but makes over-confident errors on OOD tasks; EEGXF is more conservative and stable under frequency shifts, though less calibrated in-distribution. These results reveal a practical efficiency-robustness trade-off: S5 for parameter-efficient peak accuracy; EEGXF when robustness and conservative uncertainty are critical.</p></details> |  |

To investigate how humans traverse this geometry, we introduce a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space. Using different transformer text embedding models, we construct participant-specific semantic trajectories based on cumulative embeddings and extract geometric and dynamical metrics, including distance to next, distance to centroid, entropy, velocity, and acceleration. These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines. By framing semantic navigation as a structured trajectory through embedding space, bridging cognitive modeling with learned representation, thereby establishing a pipeline for quantifying semantic representation dynamics with applications in clinical research, cross-linguistic analysis, and the assessment of artificial cognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures (excluding refs/appendix).

| **[Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer for Flight Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21004v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows. However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging. One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention, which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, submitted for IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation System</p></details> |
| **[Bifrost: Steering Strategic Trajectories to Bridge Contextual Gaps for Self-Improving Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05810v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents excel in self-improvement through reflection and iterative refinement, which reuse successful task trajectories as in-context examples to assist subsequent reasoning. However, shifting across tasks often introduces a context mismatch. Hence, existing approaches either discard the trajectories or manipulate them using heuristics, leading to a non-negligible fine-tuning cost or unguaranteed performance. To bridge this gap, we reveal a context-trajectory correlation, where shifts of context are highly parallel with shifts of trajectory. Based on this finding, we propose BrIdge contextual gap FoR imprOvised trajectory STeering (Bifrost), a training-free method that leverages context differences to precisely guide the adaptation of previously solved trajectories towards the target task, mitigating the misalignment caused by context shifts. Our trajectory adaptation is conducted at the representation level using agent hidden states, ensuring trajectory transformation accurately aligns with the target context in a shared space. Across diverse benchmarks, Bifrost consistently outperforms existing trajectory reuse and finetuned self-improvement methods, demonstrating that agents can effectively leverage past experiences despite substantial context shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Latent Signals to Reflection Behavior: Tracing Meta-Cognitive Activation Trajectory in R1-Style LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01999v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>R1-style LLMs have attracted growing attention for their capacity for self-reflection, yet the internal mechanisms underlying such behavior remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we anchor on the onset of reflection behavior and trace its layer-wise activation trajectory. Using the logit lens to read out token-level semantics, we uncover a structured progression: (i) Latent-control layers, where an approximate linear direction encodes the semantics of thinking budget; (ii) Semantic-pivot layers, where discourse-level cues, including turning-point and summarization cues, surface and dominate the probability mass; and (iii) Behavior-overt layers, where the likelihood of reflection-behavior tokens begins to rise until they become highly likely to be sampled. Moreover, our targeted interventions uncover a causal chain across these stages: prompt-level semantics modulate the projection of activations along latent-control directions, thereby inducing competition between turning-point and summarization cues in semantic-pivot layers, which in turn regulates the sampling likelihood of reflection-behavior tokens in behavior-overt layers. Collectively, our findings suggest a human-like meta-cognitive process-progressing from latent monitoring, to discourse-level regulation, and to finally overt self-reflection. Our analysis code can be found at https://github.com/DYR1/S3-CoT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical description and dimension reduction of continuous time categorical trajectories with multivariate functional principal components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09986v4)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Getting tools that allow simple representations and comparisons of a set of categorical trajectories is of major interest for statisticians. Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random indicator function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical description of the categorical trajectories into a multivariate functional principal components analysis. This viewpoint encompasses experimental frameworks where two or more states can be observed simultaneously. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories are not supposed to be continuous and can be observed exhaustively. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, the means and the (multivariate) covariance function are continuous and have interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities. Considering a functional data point of view, we show that the binary trajectories, which are right-continuous functions with left-hand limits, can be seen as random elements in the Hilbert space of square integrable functions. The multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret and we show that we can get consistent estimators of the mean trajectories and the covariance functions under weak regularity assumptions. The ability of the approach to represent categorical trajectories in a small dimension space is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments.</p></details> |  |

Global-reference becomes ambiguous under multiple motions, while the local pointmap relies heavily on estimated relative poses and can drift, causing cross-frame misalignment and duplicated structures. We propose TrajVG, a reconstruction framework that makes cross-frame 3D correspondence an explicit prediction by estimating camera-coordinate 3D trajectories. We couple sparse trajectories, per-frame local point maps, and relative camera poses with geometric consistency objectives: (i) bidirectional trajectory-pointmap consistency with controlled gradient flow, and (ii) a pose consistency objective driven by static track anchors that suppresses gradients from dynamic regions. To scale training to in-the-wild videos where 3D trajectory labels are scarce, we reformulate the same coupling constraints into self-supervised objectives using only pseudo 2D tracks, enabling unified training with mixed supervision. Extensive experiments across 3D tracking, pose estimation, pointmap reconstruction, and video depth show that TrajVG surpasses the current feedforward performance baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizable Trajectory Prediction via Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Mamba-Graph Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12474v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate driving behavior modeling is fundamental to safe and efficient trajectory prediction, yet remains challenging in complex traffic scenarios. This paper presents a novel Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that captures human-like decision-making by inferring diverse reward functions, enabling robust cross-scenario adaptability. The learned reward function is utilized to maximize the likelihood of output by integrating Mamba blocks for efficient long-sequence dependency modeling with graph attention networks to encode spatial interactions among traffic agents. Comprehensive evaluations on urban intersections and roundabouts demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms various popular approaches in terms of prediction accuracy but also achieves 2.3 times higher generalization performance to unseen scenarios compared to other baselines, achieving adaptability in Out-of-Distribution settings that is competitive with fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Informed Diffusion Models for Vehicle Speed Trajectory Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05028v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic vehicle speed trajectory generation is essential for evaluating vehicle control algorithms and connected vehicle technologies. Traditional Markov chain approaches suffer from discretization artifacts and limited expressiveness. This paper proposes a physics-informed diffusion framework for conditional micro-trip synthesis, combining a dual-channel speed-acceleration representation with soft physics constraints that resolve optimization conflicts inherent to hard-constraint formulations. We compare a 1D U-Net architecture against a transformer-based Conditional Score-based Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) model using 6,367 GPS-derived micro-trips. CSDI achieves superior distribution matching (Wasserstein distance 0.30 for speed, 0.026 for acceleration), strong indistinguishability from real data (discriminative score 0.49), and validated utility for downstream energy assessment tasks. The methodology enables scalable generation of realistic driving profiles for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications without costly field data collection.</p></details> |  |

Existing soft-constraint methods achieve faster computation, but either (1) decouple spatial and temporal optimization or (2) restrict the search space. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MIGHTY, a Hermite spline-based planner that performs spatiotemporal optimization while fully leveraging the continuous search space of a spline. In simulation, MIGHTY achieves a 9.3% reduction in computation time and a 13.1% reduction in travel time over state-of-the-art baselines, with a 100% success rate. In hardware, MIGHTY completes multiple high-speed flights up to 6.7 m/s in a cluttered static environment and long-duration flights with dynamically added obstacles.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Fine-grained Classification of A Million Life Trajectories from Wikipedia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04503v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Life trajectories of notable people convey essential messages for human dynamics research. These trajectories consist of (\textit{person, time, location, activity type}) tuples recording when and where a person was born, went to school, started a job, or fought in a war. However, current studies only cover limited activity types such as births and deaths, lacking large-scale fine-grained trajectories. Using a tool that extracts (\textit{person, time, location}) triples from Wikipedia, we formulate the problem of classifying these triples into 24 carefully-defined types using textual context as complementary information. The challenge is that triple entities are often scattered in noisy contexts. We use syntactic graphs to bring triple entities and relevant information closer, fusing them with text embeddings to classify life trajectory activities. Since Wikipedia text quality varies, we use LLMs to refine the text for more standardized syntactic graphs. Our framework achieves 84.5\% accuracy, surpassing baselines. We construct the largest fine-grained life trajectory dataset with 3.8 million labeled activities for 589,193 individuals spanning 3 centuries. In the end, we showcase how these trajectories can support grand narratives of human dynamics across time and space. Code/data are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Rejection Sampling: Trajectory Fusion for Scaling Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04391v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have made impressive strides in mathematical reasoning, often fine-tuned using rejection sampling that retains only correct reasoning trajectories. While effective, this paradigm treats supervision as a binary filter that systematically excludes teacher-generated errors, leaving a gap in how reasoning failures are modeled during training. In this paper, we propose TrajFusion, a fine-tuning strategy that reframes rejection sampling as a structured supervision construction process. Specifically, TrajFusion forms fused trajectories that explicitly model trial-and-error reasoning by interleaving selected incorrect trajectories with reflection prompts and correct trajectories. The length of each fused sample is adaptively controlled based on the frequency and diversity of teacher errors, providing richer supervision for challenging problems while safely reducing to vanilla rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) when error signals are uninformative. TrajFusion requires no changes to the architecture or training objective. Extensive experiments across multiple math benchmarks demonstrate that TrajFusion consistently outperforms RFT, particularly on challenging and long-form reasoning problems.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes the SDD Planner, a diffusion-based framework designed to effectively reconcile safety constraints with driving styles in real time. The framework integrates two core modules: a Multi-Source Style-Aware Encoder, which employs distance-sensitive attention to fuse dynamic agent data and environmental contexts for heterogeneous safety-style perception; and a Style-Guided Dynamic Trajectory Generator, which adaptively modulates priority weights within the diffusion denoising process to generate user-preferred yet safe trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDD Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the StyleDrive benchmark, it improves the SM-PDMS metric by 3.9% over WoTE, the strongest baseline. Furthermore, on the NuPlan Test14 and Test14-hard benchmarks, SDD Planner ranks first with overall scores of 91.76 and 80.32, respectively, outperforming leading methods such as PLUTO. Real-vehicle closed-loop tests further confirm that SDD Planner maintains high safety standards while aligning with preset driving styles, validating its practical applicability for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

While existing driving video generation methods may produce visually realistic videos, they often fail to deliver physically realistic simulations because they lack the capability to generate accurate post-collision trajectories. In this paper, we introduce AccidentSim, a novel framework that generates physically realistic vehicle collision videos by extracting and utilizing the physical clues and contextual information available in real-world vehicle accident reports. Specifically, AccidentSim leverages a reliable physical simulator to replicate post-collision vehicle trajectories from the physical and contextual information in the accident reports and to build a vehicle collision trajectory dataset. This dataset is then used to fine-tune a language model, enabling it to respond to user prompts and predict physically consistent post-collision trajectories across various driving scenarios based on user descriptions. Finally, we employ Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to render high-quality backgrounds, merging them with the foreground vehicles that exhibit physically realistic trajectories to generate vehicle collision videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the videos produced by AccidentSim excel in both visual and physical authenticity.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

One fundamental challenge is that the models exhibit limited zero-shot capability, which hampers their ability to generalize effectively to unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose GeneralVLA (Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning), a hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) model that can be more effective in utilizing the generalization of foundation models, enabling zero-shot manipulation and automatically generating data for robotics. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA model where the high-level ASM (Affordance Segmentation Module) is finetuned to perceive image keypoint affordances of the scene; the mid-level 3DAgent carries out task understanding, skill knowledge, and trajectory planning to produce a 3D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory. The intermediate 3D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Compared to alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world robotic data collection or human demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse tasks and viewpoints. Empirically, GeneralVLA successfully generates trajectories for 14 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as VoxPoser. The generated demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations or from data generated by VoxPoser, Scaling-up, and Code-As-Policies. We believe GeneralVLA can be the scalable method for both generating data for robotics and solving novel tasks in a zero-shot setting. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/GeneralVLA.

However, existing approaches suffer from prior misalignment. Their learned or fixed priors often fail to capture the full distribution of plausible futures, limiting both prediction accuracy and diversity. We theoretically establish that prediction error is lower-bounded by prior quality, making prior modeling a key performance bottleneck. Guided by this insight, we propose AGMA (Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Anchors), which constructs expressive priors through two stages: extracting diverse behavioral patterns from training data and distilling them into a scene-adaptive global prior for inference. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, Stanford Drone, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that AGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming the critical role of high-quality priors in trajectory forecasting.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |

However, its application to safety-critical physical systems remains constrained by the lack of stability guarantees. Standard RL algorithms prioritize reward maximization, often yielding policies that may induce oscillations or unbounded state divergence. There has significant work in incorporating Lyapunov-based stability guarantees in RL algorithms with key challenges being selecting a candidate Lyapunov function, computational complexity by using excessive function approximators and conservative policies by incorporating stability criterion in the learning process. In this work we propose a novel Lyapunov-constrained Soft Actor-Critic (LC-SAC) algorithm using Koopman operator theory. We propose use of extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to produce a linear approximation of the system and use this approximation to derive a closed form solution for candidate Lyapunov function. This derived Lyapunov function is incorporated in the SAC algorithm to further provide guarantees for a policy that stabilizes the nonlinear system. The results are evaluated trajectory tracking of a 2D Quadrotor environment based on safe-control-gym. The proposed algorithm shows training convergence and decaying violations for Lyapunov stability criterion compared to baseline vanilla SAC algorithm.

Real-world trajectory data frequently exhibit heterogeneity across subjects such as patients, sites, and subpopulations, yet many traditional methods are not designed to accommodate such heterogeneity in data analysis. To address this, we propose a unified framework, termed Functional Singular Value Decomposition (FSVD), for statistical learning with heterogeneous trajectories. We establish the theoretical foundations of FSVD and develop a corresponding estimation algorithm that accommodates noisy and irregular observations. We further adapt FSVD to a wide range of trajectory-learning tasks, including dimension reduction, factor modeling, regression, clustering, and data completion, while preserving its ability to account for heterogeneity, leverage inherent smoothness, and handle irregular sampling. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that FSVD-based methods consistently outperform existing approaches across these tasks. Finally, we apply FSVD to a COVID-19 case-count dataset and electronic health record datasets, showcasing its effective performance in global and subgroup pattern discovery and factor analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of the American Statistical Association, to appear</p></details> |

However, constructing such data at scale remains challenging due to two key requirements: \textbf{\emph{Executability}}, since each instance requires a suitable and often distinct Docker environment; and \textbf{\emph{Verifiability}}, because heterogeneous task outputs preclude unified, standardized verification. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{TerminalTraj}, a scalable pipeline that (i) filters high-quality repositories to construct Dockerized execution environments, (ii) generates Docker-aligned task instances, and (iii) synthesizes agent trajectories with executable validation code. Using TerminalTraj, we curate 32K Docker images and generate 50,733 verified terminal trajectories across eight domains. Models trained on this data with the Qwen2.5-Coder backbone achieve consistent performance improvements on TerminalBench (TB), with gains of up to 20\% on TB~1.0 and 10\% on TB~2.0 over their respective backbones. Notably, \textbf{TerminalTraj-32B} achieves strong performance among models with fewer than 100B parameters, reaching 35.30\% on TB~1.0 and 22.00\% on TB~2.0, and demonstrates improved test-time scaling behavior.

The optimization performance largely depends on the quality of initial trajectories. However, the selection of a high-quality initial trajectory is non-trivial and requires a considerable time budget due to the extremely large space of the solution trajectories and the lack of prior knowledge about task constraints in configuration space. To alleviate the issue, we present a learning-based initial trajectory generation method that generates high-quality initial trajectories in a short time budget by adopting example-guided reinforcement learning. In addition, we suggest a null-space projected imitation reward to consider null-space constraints by efficiently learning kinematically feasible motion captured in expert demonstrations. Our statistical evaluation in simulation shows the improved optimality, efficiency, and applicability of TO when we plug in our method's output, compared with three other baselines. We also show the performance improvement and feasibility via real-world experiments with a seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2023. <a href="https://sgvr.kaist.ac.kr/~msyoon/papers/ICRA23_RLITG/" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-https">Project Page</a></p></details> |
| **[DeepUrban: Interaction-Aware Trajectory Prediction and Planning for Automated Driving by Aerial Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10554v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficacy of autonomous driving systems hinges critically on robust prediction and planning capabilities. However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning. To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the company's compliance requirements, we would like to wait until the paper is officially published before making it publicly available on arXiv</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Quantity: Trajectory Diversity Scaling for Code Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03219v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As code large language models (LLMs) evolve into tool-interactive agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), their generalization is increasingly limited by low-quality synthetic data and the diminishing returns of quantity scaling. Moreover, quantity-centric scaling exhibits an early bottleneck that underutilizes trajectory data. We propose TDScaling, a Trajectory Diversity Scaling-based data synthesis framework for code agents that scales performance through diversity rather than raw volume. Under a fixed training budget, increasing trajectory diversity yields larger gains than adding more trajectories, improving the performance-cost trade-off for agent training. TDScaling integrates four innovations: (1) a Business Cluster mechanism that captures real-service logical dependencies; (2) a blueprint-driven multi-agent paradigm that enforces trajectory coherence; (3) an adaptive evolution mechanism that steers synthesis toward long-tail scenarios using Domain Entropy, Reasoning Mode Entropy, and Cumulative Action Complexity to prevent mode collapse; and (4) a sandboxed code tool that mitigates catastrophic forgetting of intrinsic coding capabilities. Experiments on general tool-use benchmarks (BFCL, tau^2-Bench) and code agent tasks (RebenchT, CodeCI, BIRD) demonstrate a win-win outcome: TDScaling improves both tool-use generalization and inherent coding proficiency. We plan to release the full codebase and the synthesized dataset (including 30,000+ tool clusters) upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoGen: A Two-stage Coarse-to-Fine Framework for Fine-grained Synthetic Location-based Social Network Trajectory Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07735v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important for many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and pandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data. The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation. In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[TMS: Trajectory-Mixed Supervision for Reward-Free, On-Policy SFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03073v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) are the two dominant paradigms for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance on downstream tasks. While RL generally preserves broader model capabilities (retention) better than SFT, it comes with significant costs: complex reward engineering, instability, and expensive on-policy sampling. In contrast, SFT is efficient but brittle, often suffering from catastrophic forgetting due to $\textbf{Supervision Mismatch}$: the divergence between the model's evolving policy and static training labels. We address this trade-off with $\textbf{Trajectory-Mixed Supervision (TMS)}$, a reward-free framework that approximates the on-policy benefits of RL by creating a dynamic curriculum from the model's own historical checkpoints. TMS minimizes $\textit{Policy-Label Divergence (PLD)}$, preventing the mode collapse that drives forgetting in standard SFT. Experiments across reasoning (MATH, GSM8K) and instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate that TMS effectively shifts the accuracy--retention Pareto frontier. While RL remains the gold standard for retention, TMS significantly outperforms standard and iterative SFT, bridging the gap to RL without requiring reward models or verifiers. Mechanistic analysis confirms that PLD drift accurately predicts forgetting and that TMS successfully mitigates this drift.</p></details> |  |

Maintaining safe operation under impairment to achieve task completion, i.e. fail-active operation, is our target. Focusing on actuation failures, we introduce DEFT, a diffusion-based trajectory generator conditioned on the robot's current embodiment and task constraints. DEFT generalizes across failure types, supports constrained and unconstrained motions, and enables task completion under arbitrary failure. We evaluated DEFT in both simulation and real-world scenarios using a 7-DoF robotic arm. In simulation over thousands of joint-failure cases across multiple tasks, DEFT outperformed the baseline by up to 2 times. On failures unseen during training, it continued to outperform the baseline, indicating robust generalization in simulation. Further, we performed real-world evaluations on two multi-step tasks, drawer manipulation and whiteboard erasing. These experiments demonstrated DEFT succeeding on tasks where classical methods failed. Our results show that DEFT achieves fail-active manipulation across arbitrary failure configurations and real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation</p></details> |

This linear design makes it difficult to revisit earlier states, branch into alternative search directions, or maintain global awareness under long contexts, often leading to local optima, redundant exploration, and inefficient search. We propose Re-TRAC, an agentic framework that performs cross-trajectory exploration by generating a structured state representation after each trajectory to summarize evidence, uncertainties, failures, and future plans, and conditioning subsequent trajectories on this state representation. This enables iterative reflection and globally informed planning, reframing research as a progressive process. Empirical results show that Re-TRAC consistently outperforms ReAct by 15-20% on BrowseComp with frontier LLMs. For smaller models, we introduce Re-TRAC-aware supervised fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales. Notably, Re-TRAC shows a monotonic reduction in tool calls and token usage across rounds, indicating progressively targeted exploration driven by cross-trajectory reflection rather than redundant search.</p></details> |  |
| **[Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better? A Simple Metric of Informative Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14249v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories provide rich supervision signals for distilling reasoning from teacher to student LLMs. However, both prior work and our experiments show that trajectories from stronger teachers do not necessarily yield better students, highlighting the importance of data-student suitability in distillation. Existing methods assess suitability primarily through student likelihood, favoring trajectories that align closely with the student model's current behavior but overlooking more informative ones. Addressing this, we propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), a simple metric that captures both alignment and informativeness to assess the suitability of a reasoning trajectory. RSR is motivated by the observation that effective trajectories typically balance learning signal strength and behavioral alignment by combining low absolute probability with relatively high-ranked tokens under the student model. Concretely, RSR is defined as the ratio of a trajectory's average token-wise rank to its average negative log-likelihood, and is straightforward to compute and interpret. Across five student models and reasoning trajectories from 11 diverse teachers, RSR strongly correlates with post-training reasoning performance (average Spearman 0.86), consistently outperforming existing metrics. We further demonstrate its practical utility in both trajectory selection and teacher selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages.

| **[AgentRx: Diagnosing AI Agent Failures from Execution Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02475v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents often fail in ways that are difficult to localize because executions are probabilistic, long-horizon, multi-agent, and mediated by noisy tool outputs. We address this gap by manually annotating failed agent runs and release a novel benchmark of 115 failed trajectories spanning structured API workflows, incident management, and open-ended web/file tasks. Each trajectory is annotated with a critical failure step and a category from a grounded-theory derived, cross-domain failure taxonomy. To mitigate the human cost of failure attribution, we present AGENTRX, an automated domain-agnostic diagnostic framework that pinpoints the critical failure step in a failed agent trajectory. It synthesizes constraints, evaluates them step-by-step, and produces an auditable validation log of constraint violations with associated evidence; an LLM-based judge uses this log to localize the critical step and category. Our framework improves step localization and failure attribution over existing baselines across three domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reusing Trajectories in Policy Gradients Enables Fast Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06178v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy gradient (PG) methods are a class of effective reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly when dealing with continuous control problems. They rely on fresh on-policy data, making them sample-inefficient and requiring $O(ε^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an $ε$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve efficiency is to reuse information from past iterations, such as previous gradients or trajectories, leading to off-policy PG methods. While gradient reuse has received substantial attention, leading to improved rates up to $O(ε^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories, although intuitive, remains largely unexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous theoretical evidence that reusing past off-policy trajectories can significantly accelerate PG convergence. We propose RT-PG (Reusing Trajectories - Policy Gradient), a novel algorithm that leverages a power mean-corrected multiple importance weighting estimator to effectively combine on-policy and off-policy data coming from the most recent $ω$ iterations. Through a novel analysis, we prove that RT-PG achieves a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}(ε^{-2}ω^{-1})$. When reusing all available past trajectories, this leads to a rate of $\widetilde{O}(ε^{-1})$, the best known one in the literature for PG methods. We further validate our approach empirically, demonstrating its effectiveness against baselines with state-of-the-art rates.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches predominantly rely on inversion-reconstruction trajectories, which impose an inherent trade-off: longer trajectories accumulate errors and compromise fidelity, while shorter ones fail to ensure sufficient alignment with the edit prompt. Previous attempts to address this issue typically employ backbone-specific feature manipulations, limiting general applicability. To address these challenges, we propose FlowBypass, a novel and analytical framework grounded in Rectified Flow that constructs a bypass directly connecting inversion and reconstruction trajectories, thereby mitigating error accumulation without relying on feature manipulations. We provide a formal derivation of two trajectories, from which we obtain an approximate bypass formulation and its numerical solution, enabling seamless trajectory transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowBypass consistently outperforms state-of-the-art image editing methods, achieving stronger prompt alignment while preserving high-fidelity details in irrelevant regions.</p></details> |  |

The majority of existing placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models. In addition, we developed a novel GP inference method -- the Vanilla SPDE Exchange (VaSE) -- to boost the GP posterior sampling efficiency, which is also of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17307v5)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but incurs substantial inference cost due to long autoregressive trajectories. Existing acceleration strategies either shorten traces via early stopping or compression, or adopt speculative decoding with a smaller model. However, speculative decoding provides limited gains when model agreement is low and rigidly enforces token-level consistency, overlooking the observation that some smaller models, when correct, produce significantly more concise reasoning traces that could reduce inference length. We introduce R-Stitch, a training-free hybrid decoding framework that leverages token-level entropy as an uncertainty proxy to delegate computation between a small language model (SLM) and an LLM. Our analysis shows that high-entropy tokens are more likely to induce errors, motivating an entropy-guided routing strategy that lets the SLM efficiently handle low-entropy tokens while delegating uncertain ones to the LLM, thereby avoiding full rollbacks and preserving answer quality. We further extend this design with R-Stitch$^{+}$, which learns an adaptive routing policy to adjust the token budget dynamically beyond fixed thresholds. By jointly reducing per-token decoding complexity and the number of generated tokens, our method achieves substantial acceleration with negligible accuracy loss. Concretely, it attains peak speedups of 3.00$\times$ on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, 3.85$\times$ on 14B, and 4.10$\times$ on QWQ-32B while maintaining accuracy comparable to full LLM decoding. Moreover, it naturally enables adaptive efficiency--accuracy trade-offs that can be tailored to diverse computational budgets without retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating loss of control in advanced AI systems through instrumental goal trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01699v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers at artificial intelligence labs and universities are concerned that highly capable artificial intelligence (AI) systems may erode human control by pursuing instrumental goals. Existing mitigations remain largely technical and system-centric: tracking capability in advanced systems, shaping behaviour through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, and designing systems to be corrigible and interruptible. Here we develop instrumental goal trajectories to expand these options beyond the model. Gaining capability typically depends on access to additional technical resources, such as compute, storage, data and adjacent services, which in turn requires access to monetary resources. In organisations, these resources can be obtained through three organisational pathways. We label these pathways the procurement, governance and finance instrumental goal trajectories (IGTs). Each IGT produces a trail of organisational artefacts that can be monitored and used as intervention points when a systems capabilities or behaviour exceed acceptable thresholds. In this way, IGTs offer concrete avenues for defining capability levels and for broadening how corrigibility and interruptibility are implemented, shifting attention from model properties alone to the organisational systems that enable them.</p></details> |  |

Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step, preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream segmentation tasks. We release the code at: https://github.com/Chhro123/fast-foreground-aware-anomaly-synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Because both mechanisms can yield identical task success on the original interface, benchmark scores alone are not identifiable evidence of environment-invariant capability. We propose PIPE, a protocol-level evaluation augmentation for diagnosing interface reliance by minimally rewriting environment interfaces while preserving task semantics and execution behavior. Across 16 environments from AgentBench and AgentGym and a range of open-source and API-based agents, PIPE reveals that trajectory-SFT substantially amplifies interface shortcutting: trained agents degrade sharply under minimal interface rewrites, while non-trajectory-trained models remain largely stable. We further introduce Interface Reliance (IR), a counterbalanced alias-based metric that quantifies preference for training-time interfaces, and show that interface shortcutting exhibits environment-dependent, non-monotonic training dynamics that remain invisible under standard evaluation. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/What-Do-Agents-Learn-from-Trajectory-SFT-Semantics-or-Interfaces--0831/.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose an efficient controller for trajectory tracking of marine vehicles under unknown disturbances by combining a convex error-state MPC on the Lie group augmented by an online learning module to compensate for these disturbances in real time. This design enables adaptive and robust tracking control while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations in the Virtual RobotX (VRX) simulator, and real-world field experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior tracking accuracy under various disturbance scenarios compared with existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

It combines the exploratory capacity of conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) to generate trajectories and the semantic segmentation capabilities of a lightweight visual language model (VLM) to select the trajectory to execute. Open-vocabulary segmentation is used to score and select the generated trajectories based on natural language, and a state-of-the-art local planner executes velocity commands. One of the key features of the proposed approach is its ability to generate a large variability of trajectories and to select them and navigate in real-time. The approach was validated through real-world outdoor navigation experiments, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

This paper proposes a fully data-driven, graph-based framework for blind floor separation using only Wi-Fi fingerprint trajectories, without requiring prior building information or knowledge of the number of floors. In the proposed method, Wi-Fi fingerprints are represented as nodes in a trajectory graph, where edges capture both signal similarity and sequential movement context. Structural node embeddings are learned via Node2Vec, and floor-level partitions are obtained using K-Means clustering with automatic cluster number estimation. The framework is evaluated on multiple publicly available datasets, including a newly released Huawei University Challenge 2021 dataset and a restructured version of the UJIIndoorLoc benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively captures the intrinsic vertical structure of multistory buildings using only received signal strength data. By eliminating dependence on building-specific metadata, the proposed method provides a scalable and practical solution for vertical localization in indoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages,4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Many existing distribution-matching approaches struggle in this regime because they impose strict support constraints and rely on brittle one-step models, making it hard to extract useful signal from imperfect data. To tackle this challenge, we propose TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding for offline LfO that constructs a dense, smooth surrogate reward by estimating expert state density in the latent space of a temporal diffusion model trained on offline trajectory data. By leveraging the smooth geometry of the learned diffusion embedding, TGE captures long-horizon temporal dynamics and effectively bridges the gap between disjoint supports, ensuring a robust learning signal even when offline data is distributionally distinct from the expert. Empirically, the proposed approach consistently matches or outperforms prior offline LfO methods across a range of D4RL locomotion and manipulation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, their prohibitively slow inference due to a large number of denoising steps limits their potential use in real-time or interactive applications. Existing acceleration methods, like distillation, truncation, or consistency training, either degrade quality, incur costly retraining, or lack generalization. We propose FlowCast, a training-free speculative generation framework that accelerates inference by exploiting the fact that FM models are trained to preserve constant velocity. FlowCast speculates future velocity by extrapolating current velocity without incurring additional time cost, and accepts it if it is within a mean-squared error threshold. This constant-velocity forecasting allows redundant steps in stable regions to be aggressively skipped while retaining precision in complex ones. FlowCast is a plug-and-play framework that integrates seamlessly with any FM model and requires no auxiliary networks. We also present a theoretical analysis and bound the worst-case deviation between speculative and full FM trajectories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FlowCast achieves $>2.5\times$ speedup in image generation, video generation, and editing tasks, outperforming existing baselines with no quality loss as compared to standard full generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2026)</p></details> |

Our approach leverages a 4-dimensional spatio-temporal planner, integrated with vision-based Safe Flight Corridor (SFC) generation and trajectory optimization. Unlike prior methods that rely on map fusion, our framework is mapless, enabling collision avoidance directly from perception while reducing computational overhead. Dynamic obstacles are detected and tracked using a vision-based object segmentation and tracking pipeline, allowing robust classification of static versus dynamic elements in the scene. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a backup planning module that reactively avoids dynamic obstacles when no direct path to the goal is available, mitigating the risk of collisions during deadlock situations. We validate our method extensively in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments, and benchmark it against state-of-the-art approaches, showing significant advantages for reactive UAV navigation in dynamic, unknown environments.</p></details> |  |

Recent generative models promise end-to-end synthesis, but their reliance on unstructured noise priors often yields unsafe, inefficient, or unimodal plans that cannot meet real-time requirements. We propose StepNav, a novel framework that bridges this gap by introducing structured, multimodal trajectory priors derived from variational principles. StepNav first learns a geometry-aware success probability field to identify all feasible navigation corridors. These corridors are then used to construct an explicit, multi-modal mixture prior that initializes a conditional flow-matching process. This refinement is formulated as an optimal control problem with explicit smoothness and safety regularization. By replacing unstructured noise with physically-grounded candidates, StepNav generates safer and more efficient plans in significantly fewer steps. Experiments in both simulation and real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in robustness, efficiency, and safety over state-of-the-art generative planners, advancing reliable trajectory generation for practical autonomous navigation.

| **[Discrete Diffusion Trajectory Alignment via Stepwise Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04832v3)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we propose an offline preference optimization method to approach trajectory alignment for discrete diffusion models. Instead of applying the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise alignment objectives by matching the per-step posterior. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization, is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, yields an equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design, protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 81.2 on LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |
| **[SEISMO: Increasing Sample Efficiency in Molecular Optimization with a Trajectory-Aware LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00663v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing the structure of molecules to achieve desired properties is a central bottleneck across the chemical sciences, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry where it underlies the discovery of new drugs. Since molecular property evaluation often relies on costly and rate-limited oracles, such as experimental assays, molecular optimization must be highly sample-efficient. To address this, we introduce SEISMO, an LLM agent that performs strictly online, inference-time molecular optimization, updating after every oracle call without the need for population-based or batched learning. SEISMO conditions each proposal on the full optimization trajectory, combining natural-language task descriptions with scalar scores and, when available, structured explanatory feedback. Across the Practical Molecular Optimization benchmark of 23 tasks, SEISMO achieves a 2-3 times higher area under the optimisation curve than prior methods, often reaching near-maximal task scores within 50 oracle calls. Our additional medicinal-chemistry tasks show that providing explanatory feedback further improves efficiency, demonstrating that leveraging domain knowledge and structured information is key to sample-efficient molecular optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fabia...</summary><p>Fabian P.

Traditional methods, focusing on simplistic spatio-temporal features, face challenges of complex calculations, limited scalability, and inadequate adaptability to real-world complexities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the development and recent advances in trajectory computing, from deep learning to the more recent large language models. We first define trajectory data and provide a brief overview of widely-used deep learning models. Systematically, we explore deep learning applications in trajectory management (pre-processing, storage, analysis, and visualization) and mining (trajectory-related forecasting, trajectory-related recommendation, trajectory classification, travel time estimation, anomaly detection, and mobility generation). Furthermore, we discuss emerging research directions and recent advancements in large models (represented by foundation models and large language models) for trajectory computing, which promise to reshape the next generation of trajectory computing. Additionally, we summarize application scenarios, public datasets, and toolkits. Finally, we outline current challenges in trajectory computing research and propose future directions.

However, we find that the perpendicular component of the pushing force from negative samples in contrastive learning is a double-edged sword: it contains rich supplementary information from negative samples, yet its unconstrained nature causes optimization trajectory drift and training instability. To address this, we propose Support Vector Regularization (SVR), a method that introduces an auxiliary support vector to control this perpendicular component, aiming to harness its rich information while mitigating the associated trajectory drift. The efficacy of SVR is critically governed by its semantic radius, for which we explore two unsupervised modeling strategies: direct parameterization and an adaptive radius predictor module enhanced with constraints to improve its predicting accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses widely used baselines like InfoNCE and SigLIP loss across classification, monolingual retrieval, and multilingual retrieval on standard audio-text datasets. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results on optimizing trajectory drift validate the correctness and effectiveness of our SVR method. Notably, our method is highly efficient, it operates without the need for extra training data or inference computation, and adds only a negligible overhead to the training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Consistency for One-Step Generation on Euler Mean Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02571v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose \emph{Euler Mean Flows (EMF)}, a flow-based generative framework for one-step and few-step generation that enforces long-range trajectory consistency with minimal sampling cost. The key idea of EMF is to replace the trajectory consistency constraint, which is difficult to supervise and optimize over long time scales, with a principled linear surrogate that enables direct data supervision for long-horizon flow-map compositions. We derive this approximation from the semigroup formulation of flow-based models and show that, under mild regularity assumptions, it faithfully approximates the original consistency objective while being substantially easier to optimize. This formulation leads to a unified, JVP-free training framework that supports both $u$-prediction and $x_1$-prediction variants, avoiding explicit Jacobian computations and significantly reducing memory and computational overhead. Experiments on image synthesis, particle-based geometry generation, and functional generation demonstrate improved optimization stability and sample quality under fixed sampling budgets, together with approximately $50\%$ reductions in training time and memory consumption compared to existing one-step methods for image generation.</p></details> | 40 pages, 27 figures |
| **[TABES: Trajectory-Aware Backward-on-Entropy Steering for Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00250v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising non-autoregressive paradigm for generative tasks, offering parallel decoding and bidirectional context utilization. However, current sampling methods rely on simple confidence-based heuristics that ignore the long-term impact of local decisions, leading to trajectory lock-in where early hallucinations cascade into global incoherence. While search-based methods mitigate this, they incur prohibitive computational costs ($O(K)$ forward passes per step). In this work, we propose Backward-on-Entropy (BoE) Steering, a gradient-guided inference framework that approximates infinite-horizon lookahead via a single backward pass. We formally derive the Token Influence Score (TIS) from a first-order expansion of the trajectory cost functional, proving that the gradient of future entropy with respect to input embeddings serves as an optimal control signal for minimizing uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce \texttt{ActiveQueryAttention}, a sparse adjoint primitive that exploits the structure of the masking objective to reduce backward pass complexity. BoE achieves a superior Pareto frontier for inference-time scaling compared to existing unmasking methods, demonstrating that gradient-guided steering offers a mathematically principled and efficient path to robust non-autoregressive generation. We will release the code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the Trajectories of Reasoning Traces in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23163v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve difficult problems by producing "reasoning traces" before emitting a final response. However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic "reasoning style" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response. More broadly, we show that trajectory probing provides diagnostics for efficient and safer deployment of reasoning models as the measurements can inform practical trace-handling and monitoring policies that improve reliability without assuming intermediate tokens are inherently faithful explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 20 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically, ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints, ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence.

To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose AutoTraj, a two-stage framework that automatically learns TIR by repairing and rewarding tool-use trajectories. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, AutoTraj generates multiple candidate tool-use trajectories for each query and evaluates them along multiple dimensions. High-quality trajectories are directly retained, while low-quality ones are repaired using a LLM (i.e., LLM-as-Repairer). The resulting repaired and high-quality trajectories form a synthetic SFT dataset, while each repaired trajectory paired with its original low-quality counterpart constitutes a dataset for trajectory preference modeling. In the reinforcement learning (RL) stage, based on the preference dataset, we train a trajectory-level reward model to assess the quality of reasoning paths and combine it with outcome and format rewards, thereby explicitly guiding the optimization toward reliable TIR behaviors. Experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoTraj in TIR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Your Deep Research Agent Fails? On Hallucination Evaluation in Full Research Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22984v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnosing the failure mechanisms of Deep Research Agents (DRAs) remains a critical challenge. Existing benchmarks predominantly rely on end-to-end evaluation, obscuring critical intermediate hallucinations, such as flawed planning, that accumulate throughout the research trajectory. To bridge this gap, we propose a shift from outcome-based to process-aware evaluation by auditing the full research trajectory. We introduce the PIES Taxonomy to categorize hallucinations along functional components (Planning vs. Summarization) and error properties (Explicit vs. Implicit). We instantiate this taxonomy into a fine-grained evaluation framework that decomposes the trajectory to rigorously quantify these hallucinations. Leveraging this framework to isolate 100 distinctively hallucination-prone tasks including adversarial scenarios, we curate DeepHalluBench. Experiments on six state-of-theart DRAs reveal that no system achieves robust reliability. Furthermore, our diagnostic analysis traces the etiology of these failures to systemic deficits, specifically hallucination propagation and cognitive biases, providing foundational insights to guide future architectural optimization. Data and code are available at https://github.com/yuhao-zhan/DeepHalluBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASTRA: Automated Synthesis of agentic Trajectories and Reinforcement Arenas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21558v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as tool-augmented agents for multi-step decision making, yet training robust tool-using agents remains challenging. Existing methods still require manual intervention, depend on non-verifiable simulated environments, rely exclusively on either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), and struggle with stable long-horizon, multi-turn learning. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRA, a fully automated end-to-end framework for training tool-augmented language model agents via scalable data synthesis and verifiable reinforcement learning. ASTRA integrates two complementary components. First, a pipeline that leverages the static topology of tool-call graphs synthesizes diverse, structurally grounded trajectories, instilling broad and transferable tool-use competence. Second, an environment synthesis framework that captures the rich, compositional topology of human semantic reasoning converts decomposed question-answer traces into independent, code-executable, and rule-verifiable environments, enabling deterministic multi-turn RL. Based on this method, we develop a unified training methodology that integrates SFT with online RL using trajectory-level rewards to balance task completion and interaction efficiency. Experiments on multiple agentic tool-use benchmarks demonstrate that ASTRA-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales, approaching closed-source systems while preserving core reasoning ability. We release the full pipelines, environments, and trained models at https://github.com/LianjiaTech/astra.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizable Multimodal Large Language Model Editing via Invariant Trajectory Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19700v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods rely on a rigid mapping from parameter or module modifications to output, which causes the generalization limitation in Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRL-Enabled Trajectory Planing for UAV-Assisted VLC: Optimal Altitude and Reward Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22512v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the integration of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and visible light communication (VLC) technologies has emerged as a promising solution to offer flexible communication and efficient lighting. This letter investigates the three-dimensional trajectory planning in a UAV-assisted VLC system, where a UAV is dispatched to collect data from ground users (GUs). The core objective is to develop a trajectory planning framework that minimizes UAV flight distance, which is equivalent to maximizing the data collection efficiency. This issue is formulated as a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To tackle it, we first derive a closed-form optimal flight altitude under specific VLC channel gain threshold. Subsequently, we optimize the UAV horizontal trajectory by integrating a novel pheromone-driven reward mechanism with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which enables adaptive UAV motion strategy in complex environments. Simulation results validate that the derived optimal altitude effectively reduces the flight distance by up to 35% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, the proposed reward mechanism significantly shortens the convergence steps by approximately 50%, demonstrating notable efficiency gains in the context of UAV-assisted VLC data collection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Drive-JEPA: Video JEPA Meets Multimodal Trajectory Distillation for End-to-End Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22032v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving increasingly leverages self-supervised video pretraining to learn transferable planning representations. However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

However, realizing these benefits in practice is non-trivial, as dLLMs inherently face an accuracy-parallelism trade-off. Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/d3LLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Guided Diffusion for Foreground-Preserving Background Generation in Multi-Layer Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21857v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a diffusion-based framework for document-centric background generation that achieves foreground preservation and multi-page stylistic consistency through latent-space design rather than explicit constraints. Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents. By reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, we offer a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling.</p></details> | 47 pages, 36 figures |

Existing methods often struggle to maintain global directional consistency, leading to drifting or implausible trajectories when extrapolated over long time horizons. To address this issue, we propose a semantic-key-point-conditioned trajectory modeling framework, in which future trajectories are predicted by conditioning on a high-level Next Key Point (NKP) that captures navigational intent. This formulation decomposes long-horizon prediction into global semantic decision-making and local motion modeling, effectively restricting the support of future trajectories to semantically feasible subsets. To efficiently estimate the NKP prior from historical observations, we adopt a pretrain-finetune strategy. Extensive experiments on real-world AIS data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly for long travel durations, directional accuracy, and fine-grained trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios: weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance, which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative models for interactive systems. https://guillem-cf.github.io/JointDiff/</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

For example, a vehicle's dynamics evolve gradually through a turning maneuver, and human gait shifts smoothly from walking to running. We formalize this setting by modeling transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finitely many atomic mechanisms, governed by time-varying mixing coefficients. Our theoretical contributions establish that both the latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are jointly identifiable. We further propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework where each expert learns one atomic mechanism during training, enabling recovery of mechanism trajectories at test time. This formulation generalizes to intermediate mechanism states never observed during training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that TRACE recovers mixing trajectories with up to 0.99 correlation, substantially outperforming discrete-switching baselines.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

Optimizing the trajectory over the full racing horizon is computationally expensive, and tracking such a trajectory in the real world hardly assures global optimality due to uncertain dynamics. Yet, existing work mostly focuses on dynamics learning at the tracking level, without updating the trajectory itself to account for the learned dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a track-centric approach that directly learns and optimizes the full-horizon trajectory. We first represent trajectories through a track-agnostic parametric space in light of the wavelet transform. This space is then efficiently explored using Bayesian optimization, where the lap time of each candidate is evaluated by running simulations with the learned dynamics. This optimization is embedded in an iterative learning framework, where the optimized trajectory is deployed to collect real-world data for updating the dynamics, progressively refining the trajectory over the iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating lap time improvement of up to 20.7% over a nominal baseline and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Modular pipelines restrict information flow and can amplify upstream errors. Recent query-based, fully differentiable perception-and-prediction (PnP) models mitigate these issues, yet the complementarity of cameras and LiDAR in the query-space has not been sufficiently explored. Models often rely on fusion schemes that introduce heuristic alignment and discrete selection steps which prevent full utilization of available information and can introduce unwanted bias. We propose Li-ViP3D++, a query-based multimodal PnP framework that introduces Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to integrate multi-view RGB and LiDAR in query space. QGDF (i) aggregates image evidence via masked attention across cameras and feature levels, (ii) extracts LiDAR context through fully differentiable BEV sampling with learned per-query offsets, and (iii) applies query-conditioned gating to adaptively weight visual and geometric cues per agent. The resulting architecture jointly optimizes detection, tracking, and multi-hypothesis trajectory forecasting in a single end-to-end model. On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ improves end-to-end behavior and detection quality, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502) while substantially reducing false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and it is faster than the prior Li-ViP3D variant (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms). These results indicate that query-space, fully differentiable camera-LiDAR fusion can increase robustness of end-to-end PnP without sacrificing deployability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This paper presents a scalable alternative: high-accuracy whole-body touch localization via vibro-acoustic sensing. By equipping a robotic hand with seven low-cost piezoelectric microphones and leveraging an Audio Spectrogram Transformer, we decode the vibrational signatures generated during physical interaction. Extensive evaluation across stationary and dynamic tasks reveals a localization error of under 5 mm in static conditions. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the distinct influence of material properties: stiff materials (e.g., metal) excel in impulse response localization due to sharp, high-bandwidth responses, whereas textured materials (e.g., wood) provide superior friction-based features for trajectory tracking. The system demonstrates robustness to the robot's own motion, maintaining effective tracking even during active operation. Our primary contribution is demonstrating that complex physical contact dynamics can be effectively decoded from simple vibrational signals, offering a viable pathway to widespread, affordable contact perception in robotics. To accelerate research, we provide our full datasets, models, and experimental setups as open-source resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review: Springer Autonomous Robots Journal</p></details> |

Despite the success of textual safety moderation, its multimodal counterparts remain hindered by a dual sparsity of data and supervision. Conventional reliance on binary labels lead to shortcut learning, which obscures the intrinsic classification boundaries necessary for effective multimodal discrimination. Hence, we propose a novel learning paradigm (UniMod) that transitions from sparse decision-making to dense reasoning traces. By constructing structured trajectories encompassing evidence grounding, modality assessment, risk mapping, policy decision, and response generation, we reformulate monolithic decision tasks into a multi-dimensional boundary learning process. This approach forces the model to ground its decision in explicit safety semantics, preventing the model from converging on superficial shortcuts. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a multi-head scalar reward model (UniRM). UniRM provides multi-dimensional supervision by assigning attribute-level scores to the response generation stage. Furthermore, we introduce specialized optimization strategies to decouple task-specific parameters and rebalance training dynamics, effectively resolving interference between diverse objectives in multi-task learning. Empirical results show UniMod achieves competitive textual moderation performance and sets a new multimodal benchmark using less than 40\% of the training data used by leading baselines. Ablations further validate our multi-attribute trajectory reasoning, offering an effective and efficient framework for multimodal moderation.

We argue that current evaluation paradigms suffer from an unanchored defect, leading to two forms of instability: process drift, where unsteered client simulation wanders away from specific counseling goals, and standard drift, where static pointwise scoring lacks the stability for reliable judgment. To address this, we introduce Ps, a unified framework that calibrates the therapeutic competence of LLMs via trajectory-anchored tournaments. We first anchor the interaction trajectory in simulation, where clients precisely control the fluid consultation process to probe multifaceted capabilities. We then anchor the battle trajectory in judgments through an efficient Swiss-system tournament, utilizing dynamic pairwise battles to yield robust Elo ratings. Beyond ranking, we demonstrate that tournament trajectories can be transformed into credible reward signals, enabling on-policy reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PsychePass and its strong consistency with human expert judgments.</p></details> |  |

Learning-based MAPF solvers offer fast and scalable planning but often produce feasible trajectories that contain unnecessary or oscillatory movements. We propose Judgelight, a post-optimization layer that improves trajectory quality after a MAPF solver generates a feasible schedule. Judgelight collapses closed subwalks in agents' trajectories to remove redundant movements while preserving all feasibility constraints. We formalize this process as MAPF-Collapse, prove that it is NP-hard, and present an exact optimization approach by formulating it as integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Experimental results show Judgelight consistently reduces solution cost by around 20%, particularly for learning-based solvers, producing trajectories that are better suited for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

To this end, a deep autoencoder (DAE) model is employed to infer the ID in the weakly nonlinear regime ($β\lesssim 1$). We find that the trajectories lie on a nonlinear manifold of dimension $m^{\ast} = 2$ embedded in a $64$-dimensional phase space. The DAE further reveals that this dimensionality increases to $m^{\ast} = 3$ at $β= 1.1$, coinciding with a symmetry breaking transition, in which additional energy modes with even wave numbers $k = 2, 4$ become excited. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the linear approach based on principal component analysis (PCA), which fails to capture the underlying structure of the data and therefore yields unreliable results in most cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures.

Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDF) enable fixed-base manipulators to model collisions directly in configuration space via smooth, implicit distances. This representation holds strong potential to bypass the nonlinear configuration-to-workspace mapping while preserving accurate whole-body geometry and providing optimization-friendly collision costs. Yet, extending this capability to mobile manipulators is hindered by unbounded workspaces and tighter base-arm coupling. We lift this promise to mobile manipulation with Generalized Configuration Space Distance Fields (GCDF), extending CDF to robots with both translational and rotational joints in unbounded workspaces with tighter base-arm coupling. We prove that GCDF preserves Euclidean-like local distance structure and accurately encodes whole-body geometry in configuration space, and develop a data generation and training pipeline that yields continuous neural GCDFs with accurate values and gradients, supporting efficient GPU-batched queries. Building on this representation, we develop a high-performance sequential convex optimization framework centered on GCDF-based collision reasoning. The solver scales to large numbers of implicit constraints through (i) online specification of neural constraints, (ii) sparsity-aware active-set detection with parallel batched evaluation across thousands of constraints, and (iii) incremental constraint management for rapid replanning under scene changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Video Generation for Robotic Manipulation with Collaborative Trajectory Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01943v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video diffusion models shows promise for generating robotic decision-making data, with trajectory conditions further enabling fine-grained control. However, existing methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex manipulation. This limitation arises from entangled features in overlapping regions, leading to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics via a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction, and models each phase using the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction. This design effectively alleviates the multi-object feature fusion issue in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency across the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge dataset, as well as RLBench and SIMPLER benchmarks, demonstrate that our method establishs new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.

A deep fusion network for multi-modal UAV trajectory prediction, termed the Multi-Modal Deep Fusion Framework, is designed. The overall architecture consists of two modality-specific feature extraction networks and a bidirectional cross-attention fusion module, aiming to fully exploit the complementary information of LiDAR and radar point clouds in spatial geometric structure and dynamic reflection characteristics. In the feature extraction stage, the model employs independent but structurally identical feature encoders for LiDAR and radar. After feature extraction, the model enters the Bidirectional Cross-Attention Mechanism stage to achieve information complementarity and semantic alignment between the two modalities. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, the MMAUD dataset used in the CVPR 2024 UG2+ UAV Tracking and Pose-Estimation Challenge is adopted as the training and testing dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-modal fusion model significantly improves trajectory prediction accuracy, achieving a 40% improvement compared to the baseline model. In addition, ablation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of different loss functions and post-processing strategies in improving model performance. The proposed model can effectively utilize multi-modal data and provides an efficient solution for unauthorized UAV trajectory prediction in the low-altitude economy.</p></details> | in Chinese language |
| **[Generative Chain of Behavior for User Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18213v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling long-term user behavior trajectories is essential for understanding evolving preferences and enabling proactive recommendations. However, most sequential recommenders focus on next-item prediction, overlooking dependencies across multiple future actions. We propose Generative Chain of Behavior (GCB), a generative framework that models user interactions as an autoregressive chain of semantic behaviors over multiple future steps. GCB first encodes items into semantic IDs via RQ-VAE with k-means refinement, forming a discrete latent space that preserves semantic proximity. On top of this space, a transformer-based autoregressive generator predicts multi-step future behaviors conditioned on user history, capturing long-horizon intent transitions and generating coherent trajectories. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that GCB consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommenders in multi-step accuracy and trajectory consistency. Beyond these gains, GCB offers a unified generative formulation for capturing user preference evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Refusal Circuits Across LLMs: Cross-Model Transfer via Trajectory Replay and Concept-Basis Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16034v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refusal behavior in aligned LLMs is often viewed as model-specific, yet we hypothesize it stems from a universal, low-dimensional semantic circuit shared across models. To test this, we introduce Trajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction, a framework that transfers refusal interventions from donor to target models, spanning diverse architectures (e.g., Dense to MoE) and training regimes, without using target-side refusal supervision. By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space. To preserve capabilities, we introduce a weight-SVD stability guard that projects interventions away from high-variance weight subspaces to prevent collateral damage. Our evaluation across 8 model pairs confirms that these transferred recipes consistently attenuate refusal while maintaining performance, providing strong evidence for the semantic universality of safety alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Trajectory Representation Learning for Travel Time Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05840v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, traditional approaches typically convert trajectory data into fixed-length representations. This overlooks the inherent variability of real-world motion patterns, often resulting in information loss and redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance the performance of TTE. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a multimodal fusion module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics, while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong generalization abilities. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/City-Computing/MDTI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Reasoning Trajectories for Hallucination Detection via Answer-agreement Representation Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17467v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) often generate long, seemingly coherent reasoning traces yet still produce incorrect answers, making hallucination detection challenging. Although trajectories contain useful signals, directly using trace text or vanilla hidden states for detection is brittle: traces vary in form and detectors can overfit to superficial patterns rather than answer validity. We introduce Answer-agreement Representation Shaping (ARS), which learns detection-friendly trace-conditioned representations by explicitly encoding answer stability. ARS generates counterfactual answers through small latent interventions, specifically, perturbing the trace-boundary embedding, and labels each perturbation by whether the resulting answer agrees with the original. It then learns representations that bring answer-agreeing states together and separate answer-disagreeing ones, exposing latent instability indicative of hallucination risk. The shaped embeddings are plug-and-play with existing embedding-based detectors and require no human annotations during training. Experiments demonstrate that ARS consistently improves detection and achieves substantial gains over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches focus on single learning experiences and do not account for students' gradual knowledge construction and evolving skill sets. Moreover, large language models are optimized to produce direct and accurate responses, making it challenging to represent the incomplete understanding and developmental constraints that characterize real learners. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for memory-based student simulation that incorporates developmental trajectories through a hierarchical memory mechanism with structured knowledge representation. The framework also integrates metacognitive processes and personality traits to enrich the individual learner profiling, through dynamical consolidation of both cognitive development and personal learning characteristics. In practice, we implement a curriculum-aligned simulator grounded on the Next Generation Science Standards. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively reflect the gradual nature of knowledge development and the characteristic difficulties students face, providing a more accurate representation of learning processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed some grammar and format issues.

Graph-based solvers provide global guarantees but assume pre-selected measurement locations, while continuous trajectory optimization supports path-based sensing but is computationally intensive and sensitive to initialization in obstacle-dense settings. We propose a hierarchical framework with three stages: (i) graph-based global planning, (ii) segment-wise budget allocation using geometric and kernel bounds, and (iii) spline-based refinement of each segment with hard constraints and obstacle pruning. By combining global guidance with local refinement, our method achieves lower posterior uncertainty than graph-only and continuous baselines, while running faster than continuous-space solvers (up to 9x faster than gradient-based methods and 20x faster than black-box optimizers) across synthetic cluttered environments and Arctic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Trajectory Alignment Coefficient in Two Acts: From Reward Tuning to Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16906v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of reinforcement learning (RL) is fundamentally tied to having a reward function that accurately reflects the task objective. Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents HumanDiffusion, a lightweight image-conditioned diffusion planner that generates human-aware navigation trajectories directly from RGB imagery. The system combines YOLO-11 based human detection with diffusion-driven trajectory generation, enabling a quadrotor to approach a target person and deliver medical assistance without relying on prior maps or computationally intensive planning pipelines. Trajectories are predicted in pixel space, ensuring smooth motion and a consistent safety margin around humans. We evaluate HumanDiffusion in simulation and real-world indoor mock-disaster scenarios. On a 300-sample test set, the model achieves a mean squared error of 0.02 in pixel-space trajectory reconstruction. Real-world experiments demonstrate an overall mission success rate of 80% across accident-response and search-and-locate tasks with partial occlusions. These results indicate that human-conditioned diffusion planning offers a practical and robust solution for human-aware UAV navigation in time-critical assistance settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at HRI, Late Breaking Report, 2026</p></details> |
| **[MoE-Enhanced Multi-Domain Feature Selection and Fusion for Fast Map-Free Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02368v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for the reliability and safety of autonomous driving systems, yet it remains a challenging task in complex interactive scenarios due to noisy trajectory observations and intricate agent interactions. Existing methods often struggle to filter redundant scene data for discriminative information extraction, directly impairing trajectory prediction accuracy especially when handling outliers and dynamic multi-agent interactions. In response to these limitations, we present a novel map-free trajectory prediction method which adaptively eliminates redundant information and selects discriminative features across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains, thereby enabling precise trajectory prediction in real-world driving environments. First, we design a MoE based frequency domain filter to adaptively weight distinct frequency components of observed trajectory data and suppress outlier related noise; then a selective spatiotemporal attention module that reallocates weights across temporal nodes (sequential dependencies), temporal trends (evolution patterns), and spatial nodes to extract salient information is proposed. Finally, our multimodal decoder-supervised by joint patch level and point-level losses generates reasonable and temporally consistent trajectories, and comprehensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance and low-latency inference performance compared with recently proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods use a single policy to produce both inference responses and training optimization trajectories. The objective conflict between generating stable inference responses and diverse training trajectories leads to insufficient exploration, which harms reasoning capability. In this paper, to address the problem, we propose R$^2$PO (Residual Rollout Policy Optimization), which introduces a lightweight Residual Rollout-Head atop the policy to decouple training trajectories from inference responses, enabling controlled trajectory diversification during training while keeping inference generation stable. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms baselines, achieving average accuracy gains of 3.4% on MATH-500 and 1.3% on APPS, while also reducing formatting errors and mitigating length bias for stable optimization.

We extend this line of work to the social sciences by introducing a Transformer-based generative model tailored to longitudinal socio-economic data. Our contributions are: (i) we design a novel encoding method that represents socio-economic life histories as sequences, including overlapping events across life domains; and (ii) we adapt generative modelling techniques to simulate plausible alternative life trajectories conditioned on past histories. Using large-scale data from the Italian social security administration (INPS), we show that the model can be trained at scale, reproduces realistic labour market patterns consistent with known causal relationships, and generates coherent hypothetical life paths. This work demonstrates the feasibility of generative modelling for socio-economic trajectories and opens new opportunities for policy-oriented research, with counterfactual generation as a particularly promising application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emerging from Ground: Addressing Intent Deviation in Tool-Using Agents via Deriving Real Calls into Virtual Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15120v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have advanced tool-using agents for real-world applications, yet they often lead to unexpected behaviors or results. Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of "intent deviation" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a "Real-to-Virtual" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses. Integrating with training, RISE achieves an average 35.28% improvement in Acctask (task completion) and 23.27% in Accintent (intent alignment), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20--42.09% and 1.17--54.93% respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, addressing nonlinear equality constraints, i.e, dynamic feasibility, remains a great challenge in diffusion-based trajectory optimization. Recent diffusion-based trajectory optimization frameworks rely on a single-shooting style approach where the denoised control sequence is applied to forward propagate the dynamical system, which cannot explicitly enforce constraints on the states and frequently leads to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we propose a novel direct trajectory optimization approach via model-based diffusion, which directly generates a sequence of states. To ensure dynamic feasibility, we propose a gradient-free projection mechanism that is incorporated into the reverse diffusion process. Our results show that, compared to a recent state-of-the-art baseline, our approach leads to zero dynamic feasibility error and approximately 4x higher success rate in a quadrotor waypoint navigation scenario involving dense static obstacles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2026 American Control Conference</p></details> |

However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops. Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. Notably, CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, highlighting trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL.

To investigate how humans traverse this geometry, we introduce a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space. Using different transformer text embedding models, we construct participant-specific semantic trajectories based on cumulative embeddings and extract geometric and dynamical metrics, including distance to next, distance to centroid, entropy, velocity, and acceleration. These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines. By framing semantic navigation as a structured trajectory through embedding space, bridging cognitive modeling with learned representation, thereby establishing a pipeline for quantifying semantic representation dynamics with applications in clinical research, cross-linguistic analysis, and the assessment of artificial cognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures (excluding refs/appendix).

However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging. One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention, which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, submitted for IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation System</p></details> |
| **[Bifrost: Steering Strategic Trajectories to Bridge Contextual Gaps for Self-Improving Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05810v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents excel in self-improvement through reflection and iterative refinement, which reuse successful task trajectories as in-context examples to assist subsequent reasoning. However, shifting across tasks often introduces a context mismatch. Hence, existing approaches either discard the trajectories or manipulate them using heuristics, leading to a non-negligible fine-tuning cost or unguaranteed performance. To bridge this gap, we reveal a context-trajectory correlation, where shifts of context are highly parallel with shifts of trajectory. Based on this finding, we propose BrIdge contextual gap FoR imprOvised trajectory STeering (Bifrost), a training-free method that leverages context differences to precisely guide the adaptation of previously solved trajectories towards the target task, mitigating the misalignment caused by context shifts. Our trajectory adaptation is conducted at the representation level using agent hidden states, ensuring trajectory transformation accurately aligns with the target context in a shared space. Across diverse benchmarks, Bifrost consistently outperforms existing trajectory reuse and finetuned self-improvement methods, demonstrating that agents can effectively leverage past experiences despite substantial context shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Latent Signals to Reflection Behavior: Tracing Meta-Cognitive Activation Trajectory in R1-Style LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01999v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>R1-style LLMs have attracted growing attention for their capacity for self-reflection, yet the internal mechanisms underlying such behavior remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we anchor on the onset of reflection behavior and trace its layer-wise activation trajectory. Using the logit lens to read out token-level semantics, we uncover a structured progression: (i) Latent-control layers, where an approximate linear direction encodes the semantics of thinking budget; (ii) Semantic-pivot layers, where discourse-level cues, including turning-point and summarization cues, surface and dominate the probability mass; and (iii) Behavior-overt layers, where the likelihood of reflection-behavior tokens begins to rise until they become highly likely to be sampled. Moreover, our targeted interventions uncover a causal chain across these stages: prompt-level semantics modulate the projection of activations along latent-control directions, thereby inducing competition between turning-point and summarization cues in semantic-pivot layers, which in turn regulates the sampling likelihood of reflection-behavior tokens in behavior-overt layers. Collectively, our findings suggest a human-like meta-cognitive process-progressing from latent monitoring, to discourse-level regulation, and to finally overt self-reflection.

Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random indicator function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical description of the categorical trajectories into a multivariate functional principal components analysis. This viewpoint encompasses experimental frameworks where two or more states can be observed simultaneously. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories are not supposed to be continuous and can be observed exhaustively. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, the means and the (multivariate) covariance function are continuous and have interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities. Considering a functional data point of view, we show that the binary trajectories, which are right-continuous functions with left-hand limits, can be seen as random elements in the Hilbert space of square integrable functions. The multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret and we show that we can get consistent estimators of the mean trajectories and the covariance functions under weak regularity assumptions. The ability of the approach to represent categorical trajectories in a small dimension space is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments.</p></details> |  |

Global-reference becomes ambiguous under multiple motions, while the local pointmap relies heavily on estimated relative poses and can drift, causing cross-frame misalignment and duplicated structures. We propose TrajVG, a reconstruction framework that makes cross-frame 3D correspondence an explicit prediction by estimating camera-coordinate 3D trajectories. We couple sparse trajectories, per-frame local point maps, and relative camera poses with geometric consistency objectives: (i) bidirectional trajectory-pointmap consistency with controlled gradient flow, and (ii) a pose consistency objective driven by static track anchors that suppresses gradients from dynamic regions. To scale training to in-the-wild videos where 3D trajectory labels are scarce, we reformulate the same coupling constraints into self-supervised objectives using only pseudo 2D tracks, enabling unified training with mixed supervision. Extensive experiments across 3D tracking, pose estimation, pointmap reconstruction, and video depth show that TrajVG surpasses the current feedforward performance baseline.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that captures human-like decision-making by inferring diverse reward functions, enabling robust cross-scenario adaptability. The learned reward function is utilized to maximize the likelihood of output by integrating Mamba blocks for efficient long-sequence dependency modeling with graph attention networks to encode spatial interactions among traffic agents. Comprehensive evaluations on urban intersections and roundabouts demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms various popular approaches in terms of prediction accuracy but also achieves 2.3 times higher generalization performance to unseen scenarios compared to other baselines, achieving adaptability in Out-of-Distribution settings that is competitive with fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Informed Diffusion Models for Vehicle Speed Trajectory Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05028v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic vehicle speed trajectory generation is essential for evaluating vehicle control algorithms and connected vehicle technologies. Traditional Markov chain approaches suffer from discretization artifacts and limited expressiveness. This paper proposes a physics-informed diffusion framework for conditional micro-trip synthesis, combining a dual-channel speed-acceleration representation with soft physics constraints that resolve optimization conflicts inherent to hard-constraint formulations. We compare a 1D U-Net architecture against a transformer-based Conditional Score-based Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) model using 6,367 GPS-derived micro-trips. CSDI achieves superior distribution matching (Wasserstein distance 0.30 for speed, 0.026 for acceleration), strong indistinguishability from real data (discriminative score 0.49), and validated utility for downstream energy assessment tasks. The methodology enables scalable generation of realistic driving profiles for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications without costly field data collection.</p></details> |  |

Existing soft-constraint methods achieve faster computation, but either (1) decouple spatial and temporal optimization or (2) restrict the search space. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MIGHTY, a Hermite spline-based planner that performs spatiotemporal optimization while fully leveraging the continuous search space of a spline. In simulation, MIGHTY achieves a 9.3% reduction in computation time and a 13.1% reduction in travel time over state-of-the-art baselines, with a 100% success rate. In hardware, MIGHTY completes multiple high-speed flights up to 6.7 m/s in a cluttered static environment and long-duration flights with dynamically added obstacles.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures |

These trajectories consist of (\textit{person, time, location, activity type}) tuples recording when and where a person was born, went to school, started a job, or fought in a war. However, current studies only cover limited activity types such as births and deaths, lacking large-scale fine-grained trajectories. Using a tool that extracts (\textit{person, time, location}) triples from Wikipedia, we formulate the problem of classifying these triples into 24 carefully-defined types using textual context as complementary information. The challenge is that triple entities are often scattered in noisy contexts. We use syntactic graphs to bring triple entities and relevant information closer, fusing them with text embeddings to classify life trajectory activities. Since Wikipedia text quality varies, we use LLMs to refine the text for more standardized syntactic graphs. Our framework achieves 84.5\% accuracy, surpassing baselines. We construct the largest fine-grained life trajectory dataset with 3.8 million labeled activities for 589,193 individuals spanning 3 centuries. In the end, we showcase how these trajectories can support grand narratives of human dynamics across time and space. Code/data are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Rejection Sampling: Trajectory Fusion for Scaling Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04391v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have made impressive strides in mathematical reasoning, often fine-tuned using rejection sampling that retains only correct reasoning trajectories. While effective, this paradigm treats supervision as a binary filter that systematically excludes teacher-generated errors, leaving a gap in how reasoning failures are modeled during training. In this paper, we propose TrajFusion, a fine-tuning strategy that reframes rejection sampling as a structured supervision construction process. Specifically, TrajFusion forms fused trajectories that explicitly model trial-and-error reasoning by interleaving selected incorrect trajectories with reflection prompts and correct trajectories. The length of each fused sample is adaptively controlled based on the frequency and diversity of teacher errors, providing richer supervision for challenging problems while safely reducing to vanilla rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) when error signals are uninformative. TrajFusion requires no changes to the architecture or training objective. Extensive experiments across multiple math benchmarks demonstrate that TrajFusion consistently outperforms RFT, particularly on challenging and long-form reasoning problems.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes the SDD Planner, a diffusion-based framework designed to effectively reconcile safety constraints with driving styles in real time. The framework integrates two core modules: a Multi-Source Style-Aware Encoder, which employs distance-sensitive attention to fuse dynamic agent data and environmental contexts for heterogeneous safety-style perception; and a Style-Guided Dynamic Trajectory Generator, which adaptively modulates priority weights within the diffusion denoising process to generate user-preferred yet safe trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDD Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the StyleDrive benchmark, it improves the SM-PDMS metric by 3.9% over WoTE, the strongest baseline. Furthermore, on the NuPlan Test14 and Test14-hard benchmarks, SDD Planner ranks first with overall scores of 91.76 and 80.32, respectively, outperforming leading methods such as PLUTO. Real-vehicle closed-loop tests further confirm that SDD Planner maintains high safety standards while aligning with preset driving styles, validating its practical applicability for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

While existing driving video generation methods may produce visually realistic videos, they often fail to deliver physically realistic simulations because they lack the capability to generate accurate post-collision trajectories. In this paper, we introduce AccidentSim, a novel framework that generates physically realistic vehicle collision videos by extracting and utilizing the physical clues and contextual information available in real-world vehicle accident reports. Specifically, AccidentSim leverages a reliable physical simulator to replicate post-collision vehicle trajectories from the physical and contextual information in the accident reports and to build a vehicle collision trajectory dataset. This dataset is then used to fine-tune a language model, enabling it to respond to user prompts and predict physically consistent post-collision trajectories across various driving scenarios based on user descriptions. Finally, we employ Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to render high-quality backgrounds, merging them with the foreground vehicles that exhibit physically realistic trajectories to generate vehicle collision videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the videos produced by AccidentSim excel in both visual and physical authenticity.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

One fundamental challenge is that the models exhibit limited zero-shot capability, which hampers their ability to generalize effectively to unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose GeneralVLA (Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning), a hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) model that can be more effective in utilizing the generalization of foundation models, enabling zero-shot manipulation and automatically generating data for robotics. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA model where the high-level ASM (Affordance Segmentation Module) is finetuned to perceive image keypoint affordances of the scene; the mid-level 3DAgent carries out task understanding, skill knowledge, and trajectory planning to produce a 3D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory. The intermediate 3D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Compared to alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world robotic data collection or human demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse tasks and viewpoints. Empirically, GeneralVLA successfully generates trajectories for 14 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as VoxPoser. The generated demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations or from data generated by VoxPoser, Scaling-up, and Code-As-Policies. We believe GeneralVLA can be the scalable method for both generating data for robotics and solving novel tasks in a zero-shot setting. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/GeneralVLA.

However, existing approaches suffer from prior misalignment. Their learned or fixed priors often fail to capture the full distribution of plausible futures, limiting both prediction accuracy and diversity. We theoretically establish that prediction error is lower-bounded by prior quality, making prior modeling a key performance bottleneck. Guided by this insight, we propose AGMA (Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Anchors), which constructs expressive priors through two stages: extracting diverse behavioral patterns from training data and distilling them into a scene-adaptive global prior for inference. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, Stanford Drone, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that AGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming the critical role of high-quality priors in trajectory forecasting.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |

However, its application to safety-critical physical systems remains constrained by the lack of stability guarantees. Standard RL algorithms prioritize reward maximization, often yielding policies that may induce oscillations or unbounded state divergence. There has significant work in incorporating Lyapunov-based stability guarantees in RL algorithms with key challenges being selecting a candidate Lyapunov function, computational complexity by using excessive function approximators and conservative policies by incorporating stability criterion in the learning process. In this work we propose a novel Lyapunov-constrained Soft Actor-Critic (LC-SAC) algorithm using Koopman operator theory. We propose use of extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to produce a linear approximation of the system and use this approximation to derive a closed form solution for candidate Lyapunov function. This derived Lyapunov function is incorporated in the SAC algorithm to further provide guarantees for a policy that stabilizes the nonlinear system. The results are evaluated trajectory tracking of a 2D Quadrotor environment based on safe-control-gym. The proposed algorithm shows training convergence and decaying violations for Lyapunov stability criterion compared to baseline vanilla SAC algorithm.

Real-world trajectory data frequently exhibit heterogeneity across subjects such as patients, sites, and subpopulations, yet many traditional methods are not designed to accommodate such heterogeneity in data analysis. To address this, we propose a unified framework, termed Functional Singular Value Decomposition (FSVD), for statistical learning with heterogeneous trajectories. We establish the theoretical foundations of FSVD and develop a corresponding estimation algorithm that accommodates noisy and irregular observations. We further adapt FSVD to a wide range of trajectory-learning tasks, including dimension reduction, factor modeling, regression, clustering, and data completion, while preserving its ability to account for heterogeneity, leverage inherent smoothness, and handle irregular sampling. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that FSVD-based methods consistently outperform existing approaches across these tasks. Finally, we apply FSVD to a COVID-19 case-count dataset and electronic health record datasets, showcasing its effective performance in global and subgroup pattern discovery and factor analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of the American Statistical Association, to appear</p></details> |

However, constructing such data at scale remains challenging due to two key requirements: \textbf{\emph{Executability}}, since each instance requires a suitable and often distinct Docker environment; and \textbf{\emph{Verifiability}}, because heterogeneous task outputs preclude unified, standardized verification. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{TerminalTraj}, a scalable pipeline that (i) filters high-quality repositories to construct Dockerized execution environments, (ii) generates Docker-aligned task instances, and (iii) synthesizes agent trajectories with executable validation code. Using TerminalTraj, we curate 32K Docker images and generate 50,733 verified terminal trajectories across eight domains. Models trained on this data with the Qwen2.5-Coder backbone achieve consistent performance improvements on TerminalBench (TB), with gains of up to 20\% on TB~1.0 and 10\% on TB~2.0 over their respective backbones. Notably, \textbf{TerminalTraj-32B} achieves strong performance among models with fewer than 100B parameters, reaching 35.30\% on TB~1.0 and 22.00\% on TB~2.0, and demonstrates improved test-time scaling behavior.

The optimization performance largely depends on the quality of initial trajectories. However, the selection of a high-quality initial trajectory is non-trivial and requires a considerable time budget due to the extremely large space of the solution trajectories and the lack of prior knowledge about task constraints in configuration space. To alleviate the issue, we present a learning-based initial trajectory generation method that generates high-quality initial trajectories in a short time budget by adopting example-guided reinforcement learning. In addition, we suggest a null-space projected imitation reward to consider null-space constraints by efficiently learning kinematically feasible motion captured in expert demonstrations. Our statistical evaluation in simulation shows the improved optimality, efficiency, and applicability of TO when we plug in our method's output, compared with three other baselines. We also show the performance improvement and feasibility via real-world experiments with a seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2023. <a href="https://sgvr.kaist.ac.kr/~msyoon/papers/ICRA23_RLITG/" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-https">Project Page</a></p></details> |

However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning. To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the company's compliance requirements, we would like to wait until the paper is officially published before making it publicly available on arXiv</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Quantity: Trajectory Diversity Scaling for Code Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03219v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As code large language models (LLMs) evolve into tool-interactive agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), their generalization is increasingly limited by low-quality synthetic data and the diminishing returns of quantity scaling. Moreover, quantity-centric scaling exhibits an early bottleneck that underutilizes trajectory data. We propose TDScaling, a Trajectory Diversity Scaling-based data synthesis framework for code agents that scales performance through diversity rather than raw volume. Under a fixed training budget, increasing trajectory diversity yields larger gains than adding more trajectories, improving the performance-cost trade-off for agent training. TDScaling integrates four innovations: (1) a Business Cluster mechanism that captures real-service logical dependencies; (2) a blueprint-driven multi-agent paradigm that enforces trajectory coherence; (3) an adaptive evolution mechanism that steers synthesis toward long-tail scenarios using Domain Entropy, Reasoning Mode Entropy, and Cumulative Action Complexity to prevent mode collapse; and (4) a sandboxed code tool that mitigates catastrophic forgetting of intrinsic coding capabilities. Experiments on general tool-use benchmarks (BFCL, tau^2-Bench) and code agent tasks (RebenchT, CodeCI, BIRD) demonstrate a win-win outcome: TDScaling improves both tool-use generalization and inherent coding proficiency. We plan to release the full codebase and the synthesized dataset (including 30,000+ tool clusters) upon publication.</p></details> |  |

However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data. The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation. In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[TMS: Trajectory-Mixed Supervision for Reward-Free, On-Policy SFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03073v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) are the two dominant paradigms for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance on downstream tasks. While RL generally preserves broader model capabilities (retention) better than SFT, it comes with significant costs: complex reward engineering, instability, and expensive on-policy sampling. In contrast, SFT is efficient but brittle, often suffering from catastrophic forgetting due to $\textbf{Supervision Mismatch}$: the divergence between the model's evolving policy and static training labels. We address this trade-off with $\textbf{Trajectory-Mixed Supervision (TMS)}$, a reward-free framework that approximates the on-policy benefits of RL by creating a dynamic curriculum from the model's own historical checkpoints. TMS minimizes $\textit{Policy-Label Divergence (PLD)}$, preventing the mode collapse that drives forgetting in standard SFT. Experiments across reasoning (MATH, GSM8K) and instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate that TMS effectively shifts the accuracy--retention Pareto frontier. While RL remains the gold standard for retention, TMS significantly outperforms standard and iterative SFT, bridging the gap to RL without requiring reward models or verifiers. Mechanistic analysis confirms that PLD drift accurately predicts forgetting and that TMS successfully mitigates this drift.</p></details> |  |

Maintaining safe operation under impairment to achieve task completion, i.e. fail-active operation, is our target. Focusing on actuation failures, we introduce DEFT, a diffusion-based trajectory generator conditioned on the robot's current embodiment and task constraints. DEFT generalizes across failure types, supports constrained and unconstrained motions, and enables task completion under arbitrary failure. We evaluated DEFT in both simulation and real-world scenarios using a 7-DoF robotic arm. In simulation over thousands of joint-failure cases across multiple tasks, DEFT outperformed the baseline by up to 2 times. On failures unseen during training, it continued to outperform the baseline, indicating robust generalization in simulation. Further, we performed real-world evaluations on two multi-step tasks, drawer manipulation and whiteboard erasing. These experiments demonstrated DEFT succeeding on tasks where classical methods failed. Our results show that DEFT achieves fail-active manipulation across arbitrary failure configurations and real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation</p></details> |

This linear design makes it difficult to revisit earlier states, branch into alternative search directions, or maintain global awareness under long contexts, often leading to local optima, redundant exploration, and inefficient search. We propose Re-TRAC, an agentic framework that performs cross-trajectory exploration by generating a structured state representation after each trajectory to summarize evidence, uncertainties, failures, and future plans, and conditioning subsequent trajectories on this state representation. This enables iterative reflection and globally informed planning, reframing research as a progressive process. Empirical results show that Re-TRAC consistently outperforms ReAct by 15-20% on BrowseComp with frontier LLMs. For smaller models, we introduce Re-TRAC-aware supervised fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales. Notably, Re-TRAC shows a monotonic reduction in tool calls and token usage across rounds, indicating progressively targeted exploration driven by cross-trajectory reflection rather than redundant search.</p></details> |  |

A Simple Metric of Informative Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14249v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories provide rich supervision signals for distilling reasoning from teacher to student LLMs. However, both prior work and our experiments show that trajectories from stronger teachers do not necessarily yield better students, highlighting the importance of data-student suitability in distillation. Existing methods assess suitability primarily through student likelihood, favoring trajectories that align closely with the student model's current behavior but overlooking more informative ones. Addressing this, we propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), a simple metric that captures both alignment and informativeness to assess the suitability of a reasoning trajectory. RSR is motivated by the observation that effective trajectories typically balance learning signal strength and behavioral alignment by combining low absolute probability with relatively high-ranked tokens under the student model. Concretely, RSR is defined as the ratio of a trajectory's average token-wise rank to its average negative log-likelihood, and is straightforward to compute and interpret. Across five student models and reasoning trajectories from 11 diverse teachers, RSR strongly correlates with post-training reasoning performance (average Spearman 0.86), consistently outperforming existing metrics. We further demonstrate its practical utility in both trajectory selection and teacher selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages.

We address this gap by manually annotating failed agent runs and release a novel benchmark of 115 failed trajectories spanning structured API workflows, incident management, and open-ended web/file tasks. Each trajectory is annotated with a critical failure step and a category from a grounded-theory derived, cross-domain failure taxonomy. To mitigate the human cost of failure attribution, we present AGENTRX, an automated domain-agnostic diagnostic framework that pinpoints the critical failure step in a failed agent trajectory. It synthesizes constraints, evaluates them step-by-step, and produces an auditable validation log of constraint violations with associated evidence; an LLM-based judge uses this log to localize the critical step and category. Our framework improves step localization and failure attribution over existing baselines across three domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reusing Trajectories in Policy Gradients Enables Fast Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06178v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy gradient (PG) methods are a class of effective reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly when dealing with continuous control problems. They rely on fresh on-policy data, making them sample-inefficient and requiring $O(ε^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an $ε$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve efficiency is to reuse information from past iterations, such as previous gradients or trajectories, leading to off-policy PG methods. While gradient reuse has received substantial attention, leading to improved rates up to $O(ε^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories, although intuitive, remains largely unexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous theoretical evidence that reusing past off-policy trajectories can significantly accelerate PG convergence. We propose RT-PG (Reusing Trajectories - Policy Gradient), a novel algorithm that leverages a power mean-corrected multiple importance weighting estimator to effectively combine on-policy and off-policy data coming from the most recent $ω$ iterations. Through a novel analysis, we prove that RT-PG achieves a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}(ε^{-2}ω^{-1})$. When reusing all available past trajectories, this leads to a rate of $\widetilde{O}(ε^{-1})$, the best known one in the literature for PG methods. We further validate our approach empirically, demonstrating its effectiveness against baselines with state-of-the-art rates.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches predominantly rely on inversion-reconstruction trajectories, which impose an inherent trade-off: longer trajectories accumulate errors and compromise fidelity, while shorter ones fail to ensure sufficient alignment with the edit prompt. Previous attempts to address this issue typically employ backbone-specific feature manipulations, limiting general applicability. To address these challenges, we propose FlowBypass, a novel and analytical framework grounded in Rectified Flow that constructs a bypass directly connecting inversion and reconstruction trajectories, thereby mitigating error accumulation without relying on feature manipulations. We provide a formal derivation of two trajectories, from which we obtain an approximate bypass formulation and its numerical solution, enabling seamless trajectory transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowBypass consistently outperforms state-of-the-art image editing methods, achieving stronger prompt alignment while preserving high-fidelity details in irrelevant regions.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge to applying principled active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models. In addition, we developed a novel GP inference method -- the Vanilla SPDE Exchange (VaSE) -- to boost the GP posterior sampling efficiency, which is also of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17307v5)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but incurs substantial inference cost due to long autoregressive trajectories. Existing acceleration strategies either shorten traces via early stopping or compression, or adopt speculative decoding with a smaller model. However, speculative decoding provides limited gains when model agreement is low and rigidly enforces token-level consistency, overlooking the observation that some smaller models, when correct, produce significantly more concise reasoning traces that could reduce inference length. We introduce R-Stitch, a training-free hybrid decoding framework that leverages token-level entropy as an uncertainty proxy to delegate computation between a small language model (SLM) and an LLM. Our analysis shows that high-entropy tokens are more likely to induce errors, motivating an entropy-guided routing strategy that lets the SLM efficiently handle low-entropy tokens while delegating uncertain ones to the LLM, thereby avoiding full rollbacks and preserving answer quality. We further extend this design with R-Stitch$^{+}$, which learns an adaptive routing policy to adjust the token budget dynamically beyond fixed thresholds. By jointly reducing per-token decoding complexity and the number of generated tokens, our method achieves substantial acceleration with negligible accuracy loss. Concretely, it attains peak speedups of 3.00$\times$ on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, 3.85$\times$ on 14B, and 4.10$\times$ on QWQ-32B while maintaining accuracy comparable to full LLM decoding. Moreover, it naturally enables adaptive efficiency--accuracy trade-offs that can be tailored to diverse computational budgets without retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating loss of control in advanced AI systems through instrumental goal trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01699v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers at artificial intelligence labs and universities are concerned that highly capable artificial intelligence (AI) systems may erode human control by pursuing instrumental goals. Existing mitigations remain largely technical and system-centric: tracking capability in advanced systems, shaping behaviour through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, and designing systems to be corrigible and interruptible. Here we develop instrumental goal trajectories to expand these options beyond the model. Gaining capability typically depends on access to additional technical resources, such as compute, storage, data and adjacent services, which in turn requires access to monetary resources. In organisations, these resources can be obtained through three organisational pathways. We label these pathways the procurement, governance and finance instrumental goal trajectories (IGTs). Each IGT produces a trail of organisational artefacts that can be monitored and used as intervention points when a systems capabilities or behaviour exceed acceptable thresholds. In this way, IGTs offer concrete avenues for defining capability levels and for broadening how corrigibility and interruptibility are implemented, shifting attention from model properties alone to the organisational systems that enable them.</p></details> |  |
| **[FAST: Foreground-aware Diffusion with Accelerated Sampling Trajectory for Segmentation-oriented Anomaly Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20295v5)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations, yet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label. Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step, preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream segmentation tasks. We release the code at: https://github.com/Chhro123/fast-foreground-aware-anomaly-synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Because both mechanisms can yield identical task success on the original interface, benchmark scores alone are not identifiable evidence of environment-invariant capability. We propose PIPE, a protocol-level evaluation augmentation for diagnosing interface reliance by minimally rewriting environment interfaces while preserving task semantics and execution behavior. Across 16 environments from AgentBench and AgentGym and a range of open-source and API-based agents, PIPE reveals that trajectory-SFT substantially amplifies interface shortcutting: trained agents degrade sharply under minimal interface rewrites, while non-trajectory-trained models remain largely stable. We further introduce Interface Reliance (IR), a counterbalanced alias-based metric that quantifies preference for training-time interfaces, and show that interface shortcutting exhibits environment-dependent, non-monotonic training dynamics that remain invisible under standard evaluation. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/What-Do-Agents-Learn-from-Trajectory-SFT-Semantics-or-Interfaces--0831/.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose an efficient controller for trajectory tracking of marine vehicles under unknown disturbances by combining a convex error-state MPC on the Lie group augmented by an online learning module to compensate for these disturbances in real time. This design enables adaptive and robust tracking control while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations in the Virtual RobotX (VRX) simulator, and real-world field experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior tracking accuracy under various disturbance scenarios compared with existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

It combines the exploratory capacity of conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) to generate trajectories and the semantic segmentation capabilities of a lightweight visual language model (VLM) to select the trajectory to execute. Open-vocabulary segmentation is used to score and select the generated trajectories based on natural language, and a state-of-the-art local planner executes velocity commands. One of the key features of the proposed approach is its ability to generate a large variability of trajectories and to select them and navigate in real-time. The approach was validated through real-world outdoor navigation experiments, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. A video showing an experimental run of the system can be found in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3R5ey5O2yk.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

This paper proposes a fully data-driven, graph-based framework for blind floor separation using only Wi-Fi fingerprint trajectories, without requiring prior building information or knowledge of the number of floors. In the proposed method, Wi-Fi fingerprints are represented as nodes in a trajectory graph, where edges capture both signal similarity and sequential movement context. Structural node embeddings are learned via Node2Vec, and floor-level partitions are obtained using K-Means clustering with automatic cluster number estimation. The framework is evaluated on multiple publicly available datasets, including a newly released Huawei University Challenge 2021 dataset and a restructured version of the UJIIndoorLoc benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively captures the intrinsic vertical structure of multistory buildings using only received signal strength data. By eliminating dependence on building-specific metadata, the proposed method provides a scalable and practical solution for vertical localization in indoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages,4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Imitation from Observations with Trajectory-Level Generative Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00452v2)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the offline imitation learning from observations (LfO) where the expert demonstrations are scarce and the available offline suboptimal data are far from the expert behavior. Many existing distribution-matching approaches struggle in this regime because they impose strict support constraints and rely on brittle one-step models, making it hard to extract useful signal from imperfect data. To tackle this challenge, we propose TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding for offline LfO that constructs a dense, smooth surrogate reward by estimating expert state density in the latent space of a temporal diffusion model trained on offline trajectory data. By leveraging the smooth geometry of the learned diffusion embedding, TGE captures long-horizon temporal dynamics and effectively bridges the gap between disjoint supports, ensuring a robust learning signal even when offline data is distributionally distinct from the expert. Empirically, the proposed approach consistently matches or outperforms prior offline LfO methods across a range of D4RL locomotion and manipulation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, their prohibitively slow inference due to a large number of denoising steps limits their potential use in real-time or interactive applications. Existing acceleration methods, like distillation, truncation, or consistency training, either degrade quality, incur costly retraining, or lack generalization. We propose FlowCast, a training-free speculative generation framework that accelerates inference by exploiting the fact that FM models are trained to preserve constant velocity. FlowCast speculates future velocity by extrapolating current velocity without incurring additional time cost, and accepts it if it is within a mean-squared error threshold. This constant-velocity forecasting allows redundant steps in stable regions to be aggressively skipped while retaining precision in complex ones. FlowCast is a plug-and-play framework that integrates seamlessly with any FM model and requires no auxiliary networks. We also present a theoretical analysis and bound the worst-case deviation between speculative and full FM trajectories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FlowCast achieves $>2.5\times$ speedup in image generation, video generation, and editing tasks, outperforming existing baselines with no quality loss as compared to standard full generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2026)</p></details> |

Our approach leverages a 4-dimensional spatio-temporal planner, integrated with vision-based Safe Flight Corridor (SFC) generation and trajectory optimization. Unlike prior methods that rely on map fusion, our framework is mapless, enabling collision avoidance directly from perception while reducing computational overhead. Dynamic obstacles are detected and tracked using a vision-based object segmentation and tracking pipeline, allowing robust classification of static versus dynamic elements in the scene. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a backup planning module that reactively avoids dynamic obstacles when no direct path to the goal is available, mitigating the risk of collisions during deadlock situations. We validate our method extensively in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments, and benchmark it against state-of-the-art approaches, showing significant advantages for reactive UAV navigation in dynamic, unknown environments.</p></details> |  |

Recent generative models promise end-to-end synthesis, but their reliance on unstructured noise priors often yields unsafe, inefficient, or unimodal plans that cannot meet real-time requirements. We propose StepNav, a novel framework that bridges this gap by introducing structured, multimodal trajectory priors derived from variational principles. StepNav first learns a geometry-aware success probability field to identify all feasible navigation corridors. These corridors are then used to construct an explicit, multi-modal mixture prior that initializes a conditional flow-matching process. This refinement is formulated as an optimal control problem with explicit smoothness and safety regularization. By replacing unstructured noise with physically-grounded candidates, StepNav generates safer and more efficient plans in significantly fewer steps. Experiments in both simulation and real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in robustness, efficiency, and safety over state-of-the-art generative planners, advancing reliable trajectory generation for practical autonomous navigation.

| **[Discrete Diffusion Trajectory Alignment via Stepwise Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04832v3)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we propose an offline preference optimization method to approach trajectory alignment for discrete diffusion models. Instead of applying the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise alignment objectives by matching the per-step posterior. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization, is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, yields an equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design, protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 81.2 on LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

Since molecular property evaluation often relies on costly and rate-limited oracles, such as experimental assays, molecular optimization must be highly sample-efficient. To address this, we introduce SEISMO, an LLM agent that performs strictly online, inference-time molecular optimization, updating after every oracle call without the need for population-based or batched learning. SEISMO conditions each proposal on the full optimization trajectory, combining natural-language task descriptions with scalar scores and, when available, structured explanatory feedback. Across the Practical Molecular Optimization benchmark of 23 tasks, SEISMO achieves a 2-3 times higher area under the optimisation curve than prior methods, often reaching near-maximal task scores within 50 oracle calls. Our additional medicinal-chemistry tasks show that providing explanatory feedback further improves efficiency, demonstrating that leveraging domain knowledge and structured information is key to sample-efficient molecular optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fabia...</summary><p>Fabian P.

Traditional methods, focusing on simplistic spatio-temporal features, face challenges of complex calculations, limited scalability, and inadequate adaptability to real-world complexities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the development and recent advances in trajectory computing, from deep learning to the more recent large language models. We first define trajectory data and provide a brief overview of widely-used deep learning models. Systematically, we explore deep learning applications in trajectory management (pre-processing, storage, analysis, and visualization) and mining (trajectory-related forecasting, trajectory-related recommendation, trajectory classification, travel time estimation, anomaly detection, and mobility generation). Furthermore, we discuss emerging research directions and recent advancements in large models (represented by foundation models and large language models) for trajectory computing, which promise to reshape the next generation of trajectory computing. Additionally, we summarize application scenarios, public datasets, and toolkits. Finally, we outline current challenges in trajectory computing research and propose future directions.

However, we find that the perpendicular component of the pushing force from negative samples in contrastive learning is a double-edged sword: it contains rich supplementary information from negative samples, yet its unconstrained nature causes optimization trajectory drift and training instability. To address this, we propose Support Vector Regularization (SVR), a method that introduces an auxiliary support vector to control this perpendicular component, aiming to harness its rich information while mitigating the associated trajectory drift. The efficacy of SVR is critically governed by its semantic radius, for which we explore two unsupervised modeling strategies: direct parameterization and an adaptive radius predictor module enhanced with constraints to improve its predicting accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses widely used baselines like InfoNCE and SigLIP loss across classification, monolingual retrieval, and multilingual retrieval on standard audio-text datasets. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results on optimizing trajectory drift validate the correctness and effectiveness of our SVR method. Notably, our method is highly efficient, it operates without the need for extra training data or inference computation, and adds only a negligible overhead to the training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Consistency for One-Step Generation on Euler Mean Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02571v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose \emph{Euler Mean Flows (EMF)}, a flow-based generative framework for one-step and few-step generation that enforces long-range trajectory consistency with minimal sampling cost. The key idea of EMF is to replace the trajectory consistency constraint, which is difficult to supervise and optimize over long time scales, with a principled linear surrogate that enables direct data supervision for long-horizon flow-map compositions. We derive this approximation from the semigroup formulation of flow-based models and show that, under mild regularity assumptions, it faithfully approximates the original consistency objective while being substantially easier to optimize. This formulation leads to a unified, JVP-free training framework that supports both $u$-prediction and $x_1$-prediction variants, avoiding explicit Jacobian computations and significantly reducing memory and computational overhead. Experiments on image synthesis, particle-based geometry generation, and functional generation demonstrate improved optimization stability and sample quality under fixed sampling budgets, together with approximately $50\%$ reductions in training time and memory consumption compared to existing one-step methods for image generation.</p></details> | 40 pages, 27 figures |

However, current sampling methods rely on simple confidence-based heuristics that ignore the long-term impact of local decisions, leading to trajectory lock-in where early hallucinations cascade into global incoherence. While search-based methods mitigate this, they incur prohibitive computational costs ($O(K)$ forward passes per step). In this work, we propose Backward-on-Entropy (BoE) Steering, a gradient-guided inference framework that approximates infinite-horizon lookahead via a single backward pass. We formally derive the Token Influence Score (TIS) from a first-order expansion of the trajectory cost functional, proving that the gradient of future entropy with respect to input embeddings serves as an optimal control signal for minimizing uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce \texttt{ActiveQueryAttention}, a sparse adjoint primitive that exploits the structure of the masking objective to reduce backward pass complexity. BoE achieves a superior Pareto frontier for inference-time scaling compared to existing unmasking methods, demonstrating that gradient-guided steering offers a mathematically principled and efficient path to robust non-autoregressive generation. We will release the code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the Trajectories of Reasoning Traces in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23163v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve difficult problems by producing "reasoning traces" before emitting a final response. However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic "reasoning style" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response. More broadly, we show that trajectory probing provides diagnostics for efficient and safer deployment of reasoning models as the measurements can inform practical trace-handling and monitoring policies that improve reliability without assuming intermediate tokens are inherently faithful explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 20 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Specifically, ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints, ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence.

To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose AutoTraj, a two-stage framework that automatically learns TIR by repairing and rewarding tool-use trajectories. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, AutoTraj generates multiple candidate tool-use trajectories for each query and evaluates them along multiple dimensions. High-quality trajectories are directly retained, while low-quality ones are repaired using a LLM (i.e., LLM-as-Repairer). The resulting repaired and high-quality trajectories form a synthetic SFT dataset, while each repaired trajectory paired with its original low-quality counterpart constitutes a dataset for trajectory preference modeling. In the reinforcement learning (RL) stage, based on the preference dataset, we train a trajectory-level reward model to assess the quality of reasoning paths and combine it with outcome and format rewards, thereby explicitly guiding the optimization toward reliable TIR behaviors. Experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoTraj in TIR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Your Deep Research Agent Fails? On Hallucination Evaluation in Full Research Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22984v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnosing the failure mechanisms of Deep Research Agents (DRAs) remains a critical challenge. Existing benchmarks predominantly rely on end-to-end evaluation, obscuring critical intermediate hallucinations, such as flawed planning, that accumulate throughout the research trajectory. To bridge this gap, we propose a shift from outcome-based to process-aware evaluation by auditing the full research trajectory. We introduce the PIES Taxonomy to categorize hallucinations along functional components (Planning vs. Summarization) and error properties (Explicit vs. Implicit). We instantiate this taxonomy into a fine-grained evaluation framework that decomposes the trajectory to rigorously quantify these hallucinations. Leveraging this framework to isolate 100 distinctively hallucination-prone tasks including adversarial scenarios, we curate DeepHalluBench. Experiments on six state-of-theart DRAs reveal that no system achieves robust reliability. Furthermore, our diagnostic analysis traces the etiology of these failures to systemic deficits, specifically hallucination propagation and cognitive biases, providing foundational insights to guide future architectural optimization. Data and code are available at https://github.com/yuhao-zhan/DeepHalluBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASTRA: Automated Synthesis of agentic Trajectories and Reinforcement Arenas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21558v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as tool-augmented agents for multi-step decision making, yet training robust tool-using agents remains challenging. Existing methods still require manual intervention, depend on non-verifiable simulated environments, rely exclusively on either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), and struggle with stable long-horizon, multi-turn learning. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRA, a fully automated end-to-end framework for training tool-augmented language model agents via scalable data synthesis and verifiable reinforcement learning. ASTRA integrates two complementary components. First, a pipeline that leverages the static topology of tool-call graphs synthesizes diverse, structurally grounded trajectories, instilling broad and transferable tool-use competence. Second, an environment synthesis framework that captures the rich, compositional topology of human semantic reasoning converts decomposed question-answer traces into independent, code-executable, and rule-verifiable environments, enabling deterministic multi-turn RL. Based on this method, we develop a unified training methodology that integrates SFT with online RL using trajectory-level rewards to balance task completion and interaction efficiency. Experiments on multiple agentic tool-use benchmarks demonstrate that ASTRA-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales, approaching closed-source systems while preserving core reasoning ability. We release the full pipelines, environments, and trained models at https://github.com/LianjiaTech/astra.</p></details> |  |

Existing editing methods rely on a rigid mapping from parameter or module modifications to output, which causes the generalization limitation in Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.</p></details> |  |

This letter investigates the three-dimensional trajectory planning in a UAV-assisted VLC system, where a UAV is dispatched to collect data from ground users (GUs). The core objective is to develop a trajectory planning framework that minimizes UAV flight distance, which is equivalent to maximizing the data collection efficiency. This issue is formulated as a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To tackle it, we first derive a closed-form optimal flight altitude under specific VLC channel gain threshold. Subsequently, we optimize the UAV horizontal trajectory by integrating a novel pheromone-driven reward mechanism with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which enables adaptive UAV motion strategy in complex environments. Simulation results validate that the derived optimal altitude effectively reduces the flight distance by up to 35% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, the proposed reward mechanism significantly shortens the convergence steps by approximately 50%, demonstrating notable efficiency gains in the context of UAV-assisted VLC data collection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Drive-JEPA: Video JEPA Meets Multimodal Trajectory Distillation for End-to-End Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22032v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving increasingly leverages self-supervised video pretraining to learn transferable planning representations. However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

However, realizing these benefits in practice is non-trivial, as dLLMs inherently face an accuracy-parallelism trade-off. Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/d3LLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Guided Diffusion for Foreground-Preserving Background Generation in Multi-Layer Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21857v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a diffusion-based framework for document-centric background generation that achieves foreground preservation and multi-page stylistic consistency through latent-space design rather than explicit constraints. Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents. By reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, we offer a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling.</p></details> | 47 pages, 36 figures |

Existing methods often struggle to maintain global directional consistency, leading to drifting or implausible trajectories when extrapolated over long time horizons. To address this issue, we propose a semantic-key-point-conditioned trajectory modeling framework, in which future trajectories are predicted by conditioning on a high-level Next Key Point (NKP) that captures navigational intent. This formulation decomposes long-horizon prediction into global semantic decision-making and local motion modeling, effectively restricting the support of future trajectories to semantically feasible subsets. To efficiently estimate the NKP prior from historical observations, we adopt a pretrain-finetune strategy. Extensive experiments on real-world AIS data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly for long travel durations, directional accuracy, and fine-grained trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios: weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance, which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative models for interactive systems. https://guillem-cf.github.io/JointDiff/</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

For example, a vehicle's dynamics evolve gradually through a turning maneuver, and human gait shifts smoothly from walking to running. We formalize this setting by modeling transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finitely many atomic mechanisms, governed by time-varying mixing coefficients. Our theoretical contributions establish that both the latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are jointly identifiable. We further propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework where each expert learns one atomic mechanism during training, enabling recovery of mechanism trajectories at test time. This formulation generalizes to intermediate mechanism states never observed during training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that TRACE recovers mixing trajectories with up to 0.99 correlation, substantially outperforming discrete-switching baselines.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

Optimizing the trajectory over the full racing horizon is computationally expensive, and tracking such a trajectory in the real world hardly assures global optimality due to uncertain dynamics. Yet, existing work mostly focuses on dynamics learning at the tracking level, without updating the trajectory itself to account for the learned dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a track-centric approach that directly learns and optimizes the full-horizon trajectory. We first represent trajectories through a track-agnostic parametric space in light of the wavelet transform. This space is then efficiently explored using Bayesian optimization, where the lap time of each candidate is evaluated by running simulations with the learned dynamics. This optimization is embedded in an iterative learning framework, where the optimized trajectory is deployed to collect real-world data for updating the dynamics, progressively refining the trajectory over the iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating lap time improvement of up to 20.7% over a nominal baseline and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Modular pipelines restrict information flow and can amplify upstream errors. Recent query-based, fully differentiable perception-and-prediction (PnP) models mitigate these issues, yet the complementarity of cameras and LiDAR in the query-space has not been sufficiently explored. Models often rely on fusion schemes that introduce heuristic alignment and discrete selection steps which prevent full utilization of available information and can introduce unwanted bias. We propose Li-ViP3D++, a query-based multimodal PnP framework that introduces Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to integrate multi-view RGB and LiDAR in query space. QGDF (i) aggregates image evidence via masked attention across cameras and feature levels, (ii) extracts LiDAR context through fully differentiable BEV sampling with learned per-query offsets, and (iii) applies query-conditioned gating to adaptively weight visual and geometric cues per agent. The resulting architecture jointly optimizes detection, tracking, and multi-hypothesis trajectory forecasting in a single end-to-end model. On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ improves end-to-end behavior and detection quality, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502) while substantially reducing false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and it is faster than the prior Li-ViP3D variant (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms). These results indicate that query-space, fully differentiable camera-LiDAR fusion can increase robustness of end-to-end PnP without sacrificing deployability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This paper presents a scalable alternative: high-accuracy whole-body touch localization via vibro-acoustic sensing. By equipping a robotic hand with seven low-cost piezoelectric microphones and leveraging an Audio Spectrogram Transformer, we decode the vibrational signatures generated during physical interaction. Extensive evaluation across stationary and dynamic tasks reveals a localization error of under 5 mm in static conditions. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the distinct influence of material properties: stiff materials (e.g., metal) excel in impulse response localization due to sharp, high-bandwidth responses, whereas textured materials (e.g., wood) provide superior friction-based features for trajectory tracking. The system demonstrates robustness to the robot's own motion, maintaining effective tracking even during active operation. Our primary contribution is demonstrating that complex physical contact dynamics can be effectively decoded from simple vibrational signals, offering a viable pathway to widespread, affordable contact perception in robotics. To accelerate research, we provide our full datasets, models, and experimental setups as open-source resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review: Springer Autonomous Robots Journal</p></details> |
| **[From Sparse Decisions to Dense Reasoning: A Multi-attribute Trajectory Paradigm for Multimodal Moderation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02536v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety moderation is pivotal for identifying harmful content. Despite the success of textual safety moderation, its multimodal counterparts remain hindered by a dual sparsity of data and supervision. Conventional reliance on binary labels lead to shortcut learning, which obscures the intrinsic classification boundaries necessary for effective multimodal discrimination. Hence, we propose a novel learning paradigm (UniMod) that transitions from sparse decision-making to dense reasoning traces. By constructing structured trajectories encompassing evidence grounding, modality assessment, risk mapping, policy decision, and response generation, we reformulate monolithic decision tasks into a multi-dimensional boundary learning process. This approach forces the model to ground its decision in explicit safety semantics, preventing the model from converging on superficial shortcuts. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a multi-head scalar reward model (UniRM). UniRM provides multi-dimensional supervision by assigning attribute-level scores to the response generation stage. Furthermore, we introduce specialized optimization strategies to decouple task-specific parameters and rebalance training dynamics, effectively resolving interference between diverse objectives in multi-task learning. Empirical results show UniMod achieves competitive textual moderation performance and sets a new multimodal benchmark using less than 40\% of the training data used by leading baselines. Ablations further validate our multi-attribute trajectory reasoning, offering an effective and efficient framework for multimodal moderation.

We argue that current evaluation paradigms suffer from an unanchored defect, leading to two forms of instability: process drift, where unsteered client simulation wanders away from specific counseling goals, and standard drift, where static pointwise scoring lacks the stability for reliable judgment. To address this, we introduce Ps, a unified framework that calibrates the therapeutic competence of LLMs via trajectory-anchored tournaments. We first anchor the interaction trajectory in simulation, where clients precisely control the fluid consultation process to probe multifaceted capabilities. We then anchor the battle trajectory in judgments through an efficient Swiss-system tournament, utilizing dynamic pairwise battles to yield robust Elo ratings. Beyond ranking, we demonstrate that tournament trajectories can be transformed into credible reward signals, enabling on-policy reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PsychePass and its strong consistency with human expert judgments.</p></details> |  |

Learning-based MAPF solvers offer fast and scalable planning but often produce feasible trajectories that contain unnecessary or oscillatory movements. We propose Judgelight, a post-optimization layer that improves trajectory quality after a MAPF solver generates a feasible schedule. Judgelight collapses closed subwalks in agents' trajectories to remove redundant movements while preserving all feasibility constraints. We formalize this process as MAPF-Collapse, prove that it is NP-hard, and present an exact optimization approach by formulating it as integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Experimental results show Judgelight consistently reduces solution cost by around 20%, particularly for learning-based solvers, producing trajectories that are better suited for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

To this end, a deep autoencoder (DAE) model is employed to infer the ID in the weakly nonlinear regime ($β\lesssim 1$). We find that the trajectories lie on a nonlinear manifold of dimension $m^{\ast} = 2$ embedded in a $64$-dimensional phase space. The DAE further reveals that this dimensionality increases to $m^{\ast} = 3$ at $β= 1.1$, coinciding with a symmetry breaking transition, in which additional energy modes with even wave numbers $k = 2, 4$ become excited. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the linear approach based on principal component analysis (PCA), which fails to capture the underlying structure of the data and therefore yields unreliable results in most cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures.

Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDF) enable fixed-base manipulators to model collisions directly in configuration space via smooth, implicit distances. This representation holds strong potential to bypass the nonlinear configuration-to-workspace mapping while preserving accurate whole-body geometry and providing optimization-friendly collision costs. Yet, extending this capability to mobile manipulators is hindered by unbounded workspaces and tighter base-arm coupling. We lift this promise to mobile manipulation with Generalized Configuration Space Distance Fields (GCDF), extending CDF to robots with both translational and rotational joints in unbounded workspaces with tighter base-arm coupling. We prove that GCDF preserves Euclidean-like local distance structure and accurately encodes whole-body geometry in configuration space, and develop a data generation and training pipeline that yields continuous neural GCDFs with accurate values and gradients, supporting efficient GPU-batched queries. Building on this representation, we develop a high-performance sequential convex optimization framework centered on GCDF-based collision reasoning. The solver scales to large numbers of implicit constraints through (i) online specification of neural constraints, (ii) sparsity-aware active-set detection with parallel batched evaluation across thousands of constraints, and (iii) incremental constraint management for rapid replanning under scene changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Video Generation for Robotic Manipulation with Collaborative Trajectory Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01943v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video diffusion models shows promise for generating robotic decision-making data, with trajectory conditions further enabling fine-grained control. However, existing methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex manipulation. This limitation arises from entangled features in overlapping regions, leading to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics via a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction, and models each phase using the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction. This design effectively alleviates the multi-object feature fusion issue in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency across the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge dataset, as well as RLBench and SIMPLER benchmarks, demonstrate that our method establishs new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.

A deep fusion network for multi-modal UAV trajectory prediction, termed the Multi-Modal Deep Fusion Framework, is designed. The overall architecture consists of two modality-specific feature extraction networks and a bidirectional cross-attention fusion module, aiming to fully exploit the complementary information of LiDAR and radar point clouds in spatial geometric structure and dynamic reflection characteristics. In the feature extraction stage, the model employs independent but structurally identical feature encoders for LiDAR and radar. After feature extraction, the model enters the Bidirectional Cross-Attention Mechanism stage to achieve information complementarity and semantic alignment between the two modalities. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, the MMAUD dataset used in the CVPR 2024 UG2+ UAV Tracking and Pose-Estimation Challenge is adopted as the training and testing dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-modal fusion model significantly improves trajectory prediction accuracy, achieving a 40% improvement compared to the baseline model. In addition, ablation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of different loss functions and post-processing strategies in improving model performance. The proposed model can effectively utilize multi-modal data and provides an efficient solution for unauthorized UAV trajectory prediction in the low-altitude economy.</p></details> | in Chinese language |

However, most sequential recommenders focus on next-item prediction, overlooking dependencies across multiple future actions. We propose Generative Chain of Behavior (GCB), a generative framework that models user interactions as an autoregressive chain of semantic behaviors over multiple future steps. GCB first encodes items into semantic IDs via RQ-VAE with k-means refinement, forming a discrete latent space that preserves semantic proximity. On top of this space, a transformer-based autoregressive generator predicts multi-step future behaviors conditioned on user history, capturing long-horizon intent transitions and generating coherent trajectories. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that GCB consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommenders in multi-step accuracy and trajectory consistency. Beyond these gains, GCB offers a unified generative formulation for capturing user preference evolution.</p></details> |  |

To test this, we introduce Trajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction, a framework that transfers refusal interventions from donor to target models, spanning diverse architectures (e.g., Dense to MoE) and training regimes, without using target-side refusal supervision. By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space. To preserve capabilities, we introduce a weight-SVD stability guard that projects interventions away from high-variance weight subspaces to prevent collateral damage. Our evaluation across 8 model pairs confirms that these transferred recipes consistently attenuate refusal while maintaining performance, providing strong evidence for the semantic universality of safety alignment.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, traditional approaches typically convert trajectory data into fixed-length representations. This overlooks the inherent variability of real-world motion patterns, often resulting in information loss and redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance the performance of TTE. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a multimodal fusion module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics, while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong generalization abilities.

Although trajectories contain useful signals, directly using trace text or vanilla hidden states for detection is brittle: traces vary in form and detectors can overfit to superficial patterns rather than answer validity. We introduce Answer-agreement Representation Shaping (ARS), which learns detection-friendly trace-conditioned representations by explicitly encoding answer stability. ARS generates counterfactual answers through small latent interventions, specifically, perturbing the trace-boundary embedding, and labels each perturbation by whether the resulting answer agrees with the original. It then learns representations that bring answer-agreeing states together and separate answer-disagreeing ones, exposing latent instability indicative of hallucination risk. The shaped embeddings are plug-and-play with existing embedding-based detectors and require no human annotations during training. Experiments demonstrate that ARS consistently improves detection and achieves substantial gains over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for memory-based student simulation that incorporates developmental trajectories through a hierarchical memory mechanism with structured knowledge representation. The framework also integrates metacognitive processes and personality traits to enrich the individual learner profiling, through dynamical consolidation of both cognitive development and personal learning characteristics. In practice, we implement a curriculum-aligned simulator grounded on the Next Generation Science Standards.

Graph-based solvers provide global guarantees but assume pre-selected measurement locations, while continuous trajectory optimization supports path-based sensing but is computationally intensive and sensitive to initialization in obstacle-dense settings. We propose a hierarchical framework with three stages: (i) graph-based global planning, (ii) segment-wise budget allocation using geometric and kernel bounds, and (iii) spline-based refinement of each segment with hard constraints and obstacle pruning. By combining global guidance with local refinement, our method achieves lower posterior uncertainty than graph-only and continuous baselines, while running faster than continuous-space solvers (up to 9x faster than gradient-based methods and 20x faster than black-box optimizers) across synthetic cluttered environments and Arctic datasets.</p></details> |  |

Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often struggle to filter redundant scene data for discriminative information extraction, directly impairing trajectory prediction accuracy especially when handling outliers and dynamic multi-agent interactions. In response to these limitations, we present a novel map-free trajectory prediction method which adaptively eliminates redundant information and selects discriminative features across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains, thereby enabling precise trajectory prediction in real-world driving environments. First, we design a MoE based frequency domain filter to adaptively weight distinct frequency components of observed trajectory data and suppress outlier related noise; then a selective spatiotemporal attention module that reallocates weights across temporal nodes (sequential dependencies), temporal trends (evolution patterns), and spatial nodes to extract salient information is proposed. Finally, our multimodal decoder-supervised by joint patch level and point-level losses generates reasonable and temporally consistent trajectories, and comprehensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance and low-latency inference performance compared with recently proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[R$^2$PO: Decoupling Training Trajectories from Inference Responses for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11960v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has become a central paradigm for improving LLM reasoning. However, existing methods use a single policy to produce both inference responses and training optimization trajectories. The objective conflict between generating stable inference responses and diverse training trajectories leads to insufficient exploration, which harms reasoning capability. In this paper, to address the problem, we propose R$^2$PO (Residual Rollout Policy Optimization), which introduces a lightweight Residual Rollout-Head atop the policy to decouple training trajectories from inference responses, enabling controlled trajectory diversification during training while keeping inference generation stable. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms baselines, achieving average accuracy gains of 3.4% on MATH-500 and 1.3% on APPS, while also reducing formatting errors and mitigating length bias for stable optimization.

We extend this line of work to the social sciences by introducing a Transformer-based generative model tailored to longitudinal socio-economic data. Our contributions are: (i) we design a novel encoding method that represents socio-economic life histories as sequences, including overlapping events across life domains; and (ii) we adapt generative modelling techniques to simulate plausible alternative life trajectories conditioned on past histories. Using large-scale data from the Italian social security administration (INPS), we show that the model can be trained at scale, reproduces realistic labour market patterns consistent with known causal relationships, and generates coherent hypothetical life paths. This work demonstrates the feasibility of generative modelling for socio-economic trajectories and opens new opportunities for policy-oriented research, with counterfactual generation as a particularly promising application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emerging from Ground: Addressing Intent Deviation in Tool-Using Agents via Deriving Real Calls into Virtual Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15120v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have advanced tool-using agents for real-world applications, yet they often lead to unexpected behaviors or results. Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of "intent deviation" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a "Real-to-Virtual" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses. Integrating with training, RISE achieves an average 35.28% improvement in Acctask (task completion) and 23.27% in Accintent (intent alignment), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20--42.09% and 1.17--54.93% respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAD-TRO: Projection-Augmented Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04436v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have gained popularity and attention in trajectory optimization due to their capability of modeling multi-modal probability distributions. However, addressing nonlinear equality constraints, i.e, dynamic feasibility, remains a great challenge in diffusion-based trajectory optimization. Recent diffusion-based trajectory optimization frameworks rely on a single-shooting style approach where the denoised control sequence is applied to forward propagate the dynamical system, which cannot explicitly enforce constraints on the states and frequently leads to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we propose a novel direct trajectory optimization approach via model-based diffusion, which directly generates a sequence of states. To ensure dynamic feasibility, we propose a gradient-free projection mechanism that is incorporated into the reverse diffusion process. Our results show that, compared to a recent state-of-the-art baseline, our approach leads to zero dynamic feasibility error and approximately 4x higher success rate in a quadrotor waypoint navigation scenario involving dense static obstacles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2026 American Control Conference</p></details> |
| **[CLEANER: Self-Purified Trajectories Boost Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15141v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to utilize tools like Python interpreters for complex problem-solving. However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops. Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. Notably, CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, highlighting trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL.

In this study, we utilize a clinical dataset of natural language narratives and self-reported PTSD severity scores from 1,437 individuals to comprehensively evaluate the performance of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. To understand the factors affecting accuracy, we systematically varied (i) contextual knowledge like subscale definitions, distribution summary, and interview questions, and (ii) modeling strategies including zero-shot vs few shot, amount of reasoning effort, model sizes, structured subscales vs direct scalar prediction, output rescaling and nine ensemble methods. Our findings indicate that (a) LLMs are most accurate when provided with detailed construct definitions and context of the narrative; (b) increased reasoning effort leads to better estimation accuracy; (c) performance of open-weight models (Llama, Deepseek), plateau beyond 70B parameters while closed-weight (o3-mini, gpt-5) models improve with newer generations; and (d) best performance is achieved when ensembling a supervised model with the zero-shot LLMs. Taken together, the results suggest choice of contextual knowledge and modeling strategies is important for deploying LLMs to accurately assess mental health.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Existing datasets suffer from limited physical realism in synthetic data or insufficient scale in real captures. We introduce a synthetic dataset generation framework that path-traces 3D glass models over real background imagery to create physically accurate reflection scenarios with varied glass properties, camera settings, and post-processing effects. To leverage the capabilities of Large Multimodal Model (LMM), we concatenate the image layers into a single composite input, apply joint captioning, and fine-tune the model using task-specific LoRA rather than full-parameter training. This enables our approach to achieve improved reflection removal and separation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 14 figures, accepted in WACVW 2026</p></details> |

Recent work simulates opinion dynamics with role-playing LLM agents (RPLAs), but multi-agent simulations often display unnatural group behavior (e.g., premature convergence) and lack empirical benchmarks for assessing alignment with real human group interactions. We introduce DEBATE, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating the authenticity of opinion dynamics in multi-agent RPLA simulations. DEBATE contains 36,383 messages from 2,832 U.S.-based participants across 708 groups and 107 topics, with both public messages and private Likert-scale beliefs, enabling evaluation at the utterance and group levels (and supporting future individual-level analyses). We instantiate "digital twin" RPLAs with seven LLMs and evaluate across two settings: next-message prediction and full conversation rollout, using stance-alignment and opinion-convergence metrics. In zero-shot settings, RPLA groups exhibit strong opinion convergence relative to human groups. Post-training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) improves stance alignment and brings group-level convergence closer to human behavior, though discrepancies in opinion change and belief updating remain. DEBATE enables rigorous benchmarking of simulated opinion dynamics and supports future research on aligning multi-agent RPLAs with realistic human interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Elo Lies: Hidden Biases in Codeforces-Based Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05891v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve breakthroughs in complex reasoning, Codeforces-based Elo ratings have emerged as a prominent metric for evaluating competitive programming capabilities. However, these ratings are often reported without critical experimental details, leading to significant discrepancies illustrated by recent reports where the score of the same model version fluctuated by nearly 500 points. This paper presents a systematic empirical study on the hidden factors biasing Elo evaluations: (1) the temporal ordering of submissions, (2) contest difficulty selection, and (3) run to run stochastic variability of LLMs. Utilizing a controlled benchmark of 37 recent Codeforces contests and 13,691 generated test cases, we demonstrate that Elo scores are highly sensitive to these parameters. Our findings reveal that varying submission orders can shift scores by 394 points, while contest selection can cause differences of up to 1,122 points for the same model. Run to run performance exhibits substantial instability, with a maximum difference of 349 points in mean scores observed when evaluating identical contests. We conclude that direct Elo comparisons are unreliable and potentially misleading without strict standardization and transparent reporting of experimental settings.</p></details> |  |

Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings. We emphasize principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation, with the goal of helping modelers make informed decisions about when, how, and whether to rely on LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Book ...</summary><p>Book chapter.

| **[Quantum Circuit Generation via test-time learning with large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03466v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can generate structured artifacts, but using them as dependable optimizers for scientific design requires a mechanism for iterative improvement under black-box evaluation. Here, we cast quantum circuit synthesis as a closed-loop, test-time optimization problem: an LLM proposes edits to a fixed-length gate list, and an external simulator evaluates the resulting state with the Meyer-Wallach (MW) global entanglement measure. We introduce a lightweight test-time learning recipe that can reuse prior high-performing candidates as an explicit memory trace, augments prompts with a score-difference feedback, and applies restart-from-the-best sampling to escape potential plateaus. Across fixed 20-qubit settings, the loop without feedback and restart-from-the-best improves random initial circuits over a range of gate budgets. To lift up this performance and success rate, we use the full learning strategy. For the 25-qubit, it mitigates a pronounced performance plateau when naive querying is used. Beyond raw scores, we analyze the structure of synthesized states and find that high MW solutions can correspond to stabilizer or graph-state-like constructions, but full connectivity is not guaranteed due to the metric property and prompt design. These results illustrate both the promise and the pitfalls of memory evaluator-guided LLM optimization for circuit synthesis, highlighting the critical role of prior human-made theoretical theorems to optimally design a custom tool in support of research.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Beyond Manual Planning: Seating Allocation for Large Organizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05875v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Hierarchical Seating Allocation Problem (HSAP) which addresses the optimal assignment of hierarchically structured organizational teams to physical seating arrangements on a floor plan. This problem is driven by the necessity for large organizations with large hierarchies to ensure that teams with close hierarchical relationships are seated in proximity to one another, such as ensuring a research group occupies a contiguous area. Currently, this problem is managed manually leading to infrequent and suboptimal replanning efforts. To alleviate this manual process, we propose an end-to-end framework to solve the HSAP. A scalable approach to calculate the distance between any pair of seats using a probabilistic road map (PRM) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) which is combined with heuristic search and dynamic programming approach to solve the HSAP using integer programming. We demonstrate our approach under different sized instances by evaluating the PRM framework and subsequent allocations both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-scale Score-based Variational Posterior Inference for Bayesian Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05873v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian (deep) neural networks (BNN) are often more attractive than the mainstream point-estimate vanilla deep learning in various aspects including uncertainty quantification, robustness to noise, resistance to overfitting, and more. The variational inference (VI) is one of the most widely adopted approximate inference methods. Whereas the ELBO-based variational free energy method is a dominant choice in the literature, in this paper we introduce a score-based alternative for BNN variational inference. Although there have been quite a few score-based variational inference methods proposed in the community, most are not adequate for large-scale BNNs for various computational and technical reasons. We propose a novel scalable VI method where the learning objective combines the score matching loss and the proximal penalty term in iterations, which helps our method avoid the reparametrized sampling, and allows for noisy unbiased mini-batch scores through stochastic gradients. This in turn makes our method scalable to large-scale neural networks including Vision Transformers, and allows for richer variational density families. On several benchmarks including visual recognition and time-series forecasting with large-scale deep networks, we empirically show the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[OdysseyArena: Benchmarking Large Language Models For Long-Horizon, Active and Inductive Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05843v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of autonomous agents capable of navigating complex environments. However, existing evaluations primarily adopt a deductive paradigm, where agents execute tasks based on explicitly provided rules and static goals, often within limited planning horizons. Crucially, this neglects the inductive necessity for agents to discover latent transition laws from experience autonomously, which is the cornerstone for enabling agentic foresight and sustaining strategic coherence. To bridge this gap, we introduce OdysseyArena, which re-centers agent evaluation on long-horizon, active, and inductive interactions. We formalize and instantiate four primitives, translating abstract transition dynamics into concrete interactive environments. Building upon this, we establish OdysseyArena-Lite for standardized benchmarking, providing a set of 120 tasks to measure an agent's inductive efficiency and long-horizon discovery. Pushing further, we introduce OdysseyArena-Challenge to stress-test agent stability across extreme interaction horizons (e.g., > 200 steps). Extensive experiments on 15+ leading LLMs reveal that even frontier models exhibit a deficiency in inductive scenarios, identifying a critical bottleneck in the pursuit of autonomous discovery in complex environments.

Through Research-through-Design, we created Dream-Butterfly, an in-situ conversational AI docent embodied as a small non-human companion that visitors summon for multilingual, exhibition-grounded explanations. We deployed Dream-Butterfly in a large-scale outdoor MR exhibition at a public university campus in southern China, and conducted an in-the-wild between-subject study (N=24) comparing a primarily human-led tour with an AI-led tour while keeping staff for safety in both conditions. Combining questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, we characterize how shifting the primary explanation channel reshapes explanation access, perceived responsiveness, immersion, and workload, and how visitors negotiate responsibility handoffs among staff, the AI guide, and themselves. We distill transferable design implications for configuring mixed human-AI guiding roles and embodying conversational agents in mobile, safety-constrained outdoor MR exhibitions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streaming Operator Inference for Model Reduction of Large-Scale Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12161v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection-based model reduction enables efficient simulation of complex dynamical systems by constructing low-dimensional surrogate models from high-dimensional data. The Operator Inference (OpInf) approach learns such reduced surrogate models through a two-step process: constructing a low-dimensional basis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress the data, then solving a linear least-squares (LS) problem to infer reduced operators that govern the dynamics in this compressed space, all without access to the underlying code or full model operators, i.e., non-intrusively. Traditional OpInf operates as a batch learning method, where both the SVD and LS steps process all data simultaneously. This poses a barrier to deployment of the approach on large-scale applications where dataset sizes prevent the loading of all data into memory at once. Additionally, the traditional batch approach does not naturally allow model updates using new data acquired during online computation. To address these limitations, we propose Streaming OpInf, which learns reduced models from sequentially arriving data streams. Our approach employs incremental SVD for adaptive basis construction and recursive LS for streaming operator updates, eliminating the need to store complete data sets while enabling online model adaptation. The approach can flexibly combine different choices of streaming algorithms for numerical linear algebra: we systematically explore the impact of these choices both analytically and numerically to identify effective combinations for accurate reduced model learning. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems and a large-scale turbulent channel flow demonstrate that Streaming OpInf achieves accuracy comparable to batch OpInf while reducing memory requirements by over 99% and enabling dimension reductions exceeding 31,000x, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consensus-Aligned Neuron Efficient Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Multi-Domain Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05694v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-domain machine translation (MDMT) aims to build a unified model capable of translating content across diverse domains. Despite the impressive machine translation capabilities demonstrated by large language models (LLMs), domain adaptation still remains a challenge for LLMs. Existing MDMT methods such as in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning often suffer from domain shift, parameter interference and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a neuron-efficient fine-tuning framework for MDMT that identifies and updates consensus-aligned neurons within LLMs. These neurons are selected by maximizing the mutual information between neuron behavior and domain features, enabling LLMs to capture both generalizable translation patterns and domain-specific nuances. Our method then fine-tunes LLMs guided by these neurons, effectively mitigating parameter interference and domain-specific overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on three LLMs across ten German-English and Chinese-English translation domains evidence that our method consistently outperforms strong PEFT baselines on both seen and unseen domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Alignment Verifiability in Large Language Models: Normative Indistinguishability under Behavioral Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05656v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Behavioral evaluation is the dominant paradigm for assessing alignment in large language models (LLMs). In practice, alignment is inferred from performance under finite evaluation protocols - benchmarks, red-teaming suites, or automated pipelines - and observed compliance is often treated as evidence of underlying alignment. This inference step, from behavioral evidence to claims about latent alignment properties, is typically implicit and rarely analyzed as an inference problem in its own right. We study this problem formally. We frame alignment evaluation as an identifiability question under partial observability and allow agent behavior to depend on information correlated with the evaluation regime. Within this setting, we introduce the Alignment Verifiability Problem and the notion of Normative Indistinguishability, capturing when distinct latent alignment hypotheses induce identical distributions over all evaluator-accessible signals. Our main result is a negative but sharply delimited identifiability theorem. Under finite behavioral evaluation and evaluation-aware agents, observed behavioral compliance does not uniquely identify latent alignment. That is, even idealized behavioral evaluation cannot, in general, certify alignment as a latent property. We further show that behavioral alignment tests should be interpreted as estimators of indistinguishability classes rather than verifiers of alignment. Passing increasingly stringent tests may reduce the space of compatible hypotheses, but cannot collapse it to a singleton under the stated conditions. This reframes alignment benchmarks as providing upper bounds on observable compliance within a regime, rather than guarantees of underlying alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

Building multimodal foundation models is a natural next step, but it faces key challenges: 1) lack of a unified multimodal pretraining paradigm and large-scale multimodal corpora for time series analysis; 2) how to effectively integrate heterogeneous modalities and enhance model generalization. To address these challenges, we take an early step toward multimodal foundation models for time series analysis. We first propose a multimodal pretraining paradigm that leverages time series with endogenous modalities (derived images and text) and exogenous knowledge (real-world news), providing a comprehensive multi-view perspective for time series analysis. To support this, we develop an automated data construction pipeline to curate MM-TS, the first large-scale multimodal time series dataset spanning six domains, with up to one billion points. Then we propose HORAI, a frequency-enhanced multimodal foundation model. It integrates two core components: the Frequency-enhanced Cross-Modality Encoder and the Time-Frequency Decoder, designed to effectively fuse multimodal features and enhance model generalization across modalities and domains. After pretraining on MM-TS, HORAI achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating strong generalization.</p></details> |  |

However, their inherent generation mechanisms often produce homogeneous responses to identical prompts. This one-size-fits-all mechanism overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in students cognitive and psychological, thereby posing potential safety risks to vulnerable groups. Existing safety evaluations primarily rely on context-independent metrics such as factual accuracy, bias, or toxicity, which fail to capture the divergent harms that the same response might cause across different student attributes. To address this gap, we propose the concept of Student-Tailored Personalized Safety and construct CASTLE based on educational theories. This benchmark covers 15 educational safety risks and 14 student attributes, comprising 92,908 bilingual scenarios. We further design three evaluation metrics: Risk Sensitivity, measuring the model ability to detect risks; Emotional Empathy, evaluating the model capacity to recognize student states; and Student Alignment, assessing the match between model responses and student attributes. Experiments on 18 SOTA LLMs demonstrate that CASTLE poses a significant challenge: all models scored below an average safety rating of 2.3 out of 5, indicating substantial deficiencies in personalized safety assurance.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging the multimodal reasoning abilities of VLLMs, VLN-Pilot interprets free-form natural language instructions and grounds them in visual observations to plan and execute drone trajectories in GPS-denied indoor environments. Unlike traditional rule-based or geometric path-planning approaches, our framework integrates language-driven semantic understanding with visual perception, enabling context-aware, high-level flight behaviors with minimal task-specific engineering. VLN-Pilot supports fully autonomous instruction-following for drones by reasoning about spatial relationships, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic reactivity to unforeseen events. We validate our framework on a custom photorealistic indoor simulation benchmark and demonstrate the ability of the VLLM-driven agent to achieve high success rates on complex instruction-following tasks, including long-horizon navigation with multiple semantic targets. Experimental results highlight the promise of replacing remote drone pilots with a language-guided autonomous agent, opening avenues for scalable, human-friendly control of indoor UAVs in tasks such as inspection, search-and-rescue, and facility monitoring. Our results suggest that VLLM-based pilots may dramatically reduce operator workload while improving safety and mission flexibility in constrained indoor environments.</p></details> |  |

Prior steering methods attempt to address this issue by applying a single, global vector to hidden representations -- an approach grounded in the restrictive linear representation hypothesis. In this work, we introduce FlowSteer, a nonlinear steering method that goes beyond uniform linear shifts by learning a complete transformation between the distributions associated with verbose and concise reasoning. This transformation is learned via Flow Matching as a velocity field, enabling precise, input-dependent control over the model's reasoning process. By aligning steered representations with the distribution of concise-reasoning activations, FlowSteer yields more compact reasoning than the linear shifts. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, FlowSteer demonstrates strong task performance and token efficiency compared to leading inference-time baselines. Our work demonstrates that modeling the full distributional transport with generative techniques offers a more effective and principled foundation for controlling LRMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |

However, when presented with incompetent or adversarial inputs, they frequently produce unreliable or even harmful content, such as fact hallucinations or dangerous instructions. This misalignment with human expectations, referred to as \emph{misbehaviors} of LVLMs, raises serious concerns for deployment in critical applications. These misbehaviors are found to stem from epistemic uncertainty, specifically either conflicting internal knowledge or the absence of supporting information. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods, which typically capture only overall epistemic uncertainty, have shown limited effectiveness in identifying such issues. To address this gap, we propose Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ), a fine-grained method that captures both information conflict and ignorance for effective detection of LVLM misbehaviors. In particular, we interpret features from the model output head as either supporting (positive) or opposing (negative) evidence. Leveraging Evidence Theory, we model and aggregate this evidence to quantify internal conflict and knowledge gaps within a single forward pass. We extensively evaluate our method across four categories of misbehavior, including hallucinations, jailbreaks, adversarial vulnerabilities, and out-of-distribution (OOD) failures, using state-of-the-art LVLMs, and find that EUQ consistently outperforms strong baselines, showing that hallucinations correspond to high internal conflict and OOD failures to high ignorance. Furthermore, layer-wise evidential uncertainty dynamics analysis helps interpret the evolution of internal representations from a new perspective.

| **[LIBMoE: A Library for comprehensive benchmarking Mixture of Experts in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00918v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture of experts (MoE) architectures have become a cornerstone for scaling up and are a key component in most large language models such as GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-V3, Llama-4, and Gemini-2.5. However, systematic research on MoE remains severely constrained by the prohibitive computational costs of training and evaluation, restricting large-scale studies accessible to most researchers. We introduce LibMoE, a unified framework for reproducible, efficient, and extensible MoE research that supports both pretraining and sparse-upcycling regimes. Beyond unified implementations, the framework provides transparent analytical tools for probing routing and expert dynamics. Leveraging this foundation, we conduct a comprehensive analysis along three dimensions: (i) routing dynamics, covering expert selection patterns, routing stability and optimality, and how routing entropy reveals task specialization and expert diversity; (ii) the effect of lightweight initialization on load balancing, demonstrating how subtle changes in router initialization shape early expert utilization; and (iii) training regime differences, revealing how sparse upcycling and full pretraining exhibit distinct routing patterns and stability profiles. By lowering the barrier to entry and standardizing evaluation, along with our comprehensive analysis, LibMoE broadens access to MoE research and establishes a reliable benchmark to guide future innovations.

| **[Transport and Merge: Cross-Architecture Merging for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05495v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong capabilities by scaling model capacity and training data, yet many real-world deployments rely on smaller models trained or adapted from low-resource data. This gap motivates the need for mechanisms to transfer knowledge from large, high-resource models to smaller, low-resource targets. While model merging provides an effective transfer mechanism, most existing approaches assume architecture-compatible models and therefore cannot directly transfer knowledge from large high-resource LLMs to heterogeneous low-resource targets. In this work, we propose a cross-architecture merging framework based on optimal transport (OT) that aligns activations to infer cross-neuron correspondences between heterogeneous models. The resulting transport plans are then used to guide direct weight-space fusion, enabling effective high-resource to low-resource transfer using only a small set of inputs. Extensive experiments across low-resource languages and specialized domains demonstrate consistent improvements over target models.</p></details> |  |

To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 8 tasks from the stroke level to the rally level and includes 2527 human-verified questions. Evaluating 17 representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis video understanding. Results yield two key insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Automatic Detection of Sexually Explicit Content in Spanish-Language Song Lyrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05485v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of sexually explicit content in popular music genres such as reggaeton and trap, consumed predominantly by young audiences, has raised significant societal concern regarding the exposure of minors to potentially harmful lyrical material. This paper presents an approach to the automatic detection of sexually explicit content in Spanish-language song lyrics by fine-tuning a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model on a curated corpus of 100 songs, evenly divided between expert-labeled explicit and non-explicit categories. The proposed methodology leverages transfer learning to adapt the pre-trained model to the idiosyncratic linguistic features of urban Latin music, including slang, metaphors, and culturally specific double entendres that evade conventional dictionary-based filtering systems. Experimental evaluation on held-out test sets demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves 87% accuracy, 100% precision, and 100% specificity after a feedback-driven refinement loop, outperforming both its pre-feedback configuration and a non-customized baseline ChatGPT model. A comparative analysis reveals that the fine-tuned model agrees with expert human classification in 59.2% of cases versus 55.1% for the standard model, confirming that domain-specific adaptation enhances sensitivity to implicit and culturally embedded sexual references. These findings support the viability of deploying fine-tuned large language models as automated content moderation tools on music streaming platforms. Building on these technical results, the paper develops a public policy proposal for a multi-tier age-based content rating system for music analogous to the PEGI system for video games analyzed through the PESTEL framework and Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework, establishing both the technological feasibility and the policy pathway for systematic music content regulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DistillER: Knowledge Distillation in Entity Resolution with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05452v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Entity Resolution (ER) have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving strong performance but at the cost of substantial computational resources or high financial overhead. Existing LLM-based ER approaches operate either in unsupervised settings and rely on very large and costly models, or in supervised settings and require ground-truth annotations, leaving a critical gap between time efficiency and effectiveness. To make LLM-powered ER more practical, we investigate Knowledge Distillation (KD) as a means to transfer knowledge from large, effective models (Teachers) to smaller, more efficient models (Students) without requiring gold labels. We introduce DistillER, the first framework that systematically bridges this gap across three dimensions: (i) Data Selection, where we study strategies for identifying informative subsets of data; (ii) Knowledge Elicitation, where we compare single- and multi-teacher settings across LLMs and smaller language models (SLMs); and (iii) Distillation Algorithms, where we evaluate supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning approaches. Our experiments reveal that supervised fine-tuning of Students on noisy labels generated by LLM Teachers consistently outperforms alternative KD strategies, while also enabling high-quality explanation generation. Finally, we benchmark DistillER against established supervised and unsupervised ER methods based on LLMs and SLMs, demonstrating significant improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[PPE: Positional Preservation Embedding for Token Compression in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22936v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding (\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM reasoning. Our code is available at https://github.com/MouxiaoHuang/PPE.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |
| **[Beyond touch-based human-machine interface: Control your machines in natural language by utilizing large language models and OPC UA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11300v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes an agent-based approach toward a more natural interface between humans and machines. Large language models equipped with tools and the communication standard OPC UA are utilized to control machines in natural language. Instead of touch interaction, which is currently the state-of-the-art medium for interaction in operations, the proposed approach enables operators to talk or text with machines. This allows commands such as 'Please decrease the temperature by 20 % in machine 1 and start the cleaning operation in machine 2.' The large language model receives the user input and selects one of three predefined tools that connect to an OPC UA server and either change or read the value of a node. Afterwards, the result of the tool execution is passed back to the language model, which then provides a final response to the user. The approach is universally designed and can therefore be applied to any machine that supports the OPC UA standard. The large language model is neither fine-tuned nor requires training data, only the relevant machine credentials and a parameter dictionary are included within the system prompt. The tool-calling ability and their design is evaluated on a demonstrator setup with a Siemens S7-1500 programmable logic controller with four machine parameters. Fifty synthetically generated commands on five different models were tested and the results demonstrate high success rate, with proprietary GPT-5 models achieving accuracies between 96.0 % and 98.0 %, and open-weight models reaching up to 90.0 %. Afterwards the approach was transferred to a deployed spay-coating machine. The proposed concept is supposed to contribute in advancing natural interaction in industrial human-machine interfaces.</p></details> |  |

We therefore introduce SciDef, an LLM-based pipeline for automated definition extraction. We test SciDef on DefExtra & DefSim, novel datasets of human-extracted definitions and definition-pairs' similarity, respectively. Evaluating 16 language models across prompting strategies, we demonstrate that multi-step and DSPy-optimized prompting improve extraction performance. To evaluate extraction, we test various metrics and show that an NLI-based method yields the most reliable results. We show that LLMs are largely able to extract definitions from scientific literature (86.4% of definitions from our test-set); yet future work should focus not just on finding definitions, but on identifying relevant ones, as models tend to over-generate them.

| **[HBO: Hierarchical Balancing Optimization for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12300v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on a mixture of diverse datasets poses challenges due to data imbalance and heterogeneity. Existing methods often address these issues across datasets (globally) but overlook the imbalance and heterogeneity within individual datasets (locally), which limits their effectiveness. We introduce Hierarchical Balancing Optimization (HBO), a novel method that enables LLMs to autonomously adjust data allocation during fine-tuning both across datasets (globally) and within each individual dataset (locally). HBO employs a bilevel optimization strategy with two types of actors: a Global Actor, which balances data sampling across different subsets of the training mixture, and several Local Actors, which optimizes data usage within each subset based on difficulty levels. These actors are guided by reward functions derived from the LLM's training state, which measure learning progress and relative performance improvement. We evaluate HBO on three LLM backbones across nine diverse tasks in multilingual and multitask setups. Results show that HBO consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving significant accuracy gains. Our in-depth analysis further demonstrates that both the global actor and local actors of HBO effectively adjust data usage during fine-tuning. HBO provides a comprehensive solution to the challenges of data imbalance and heterogeneity in LLM fine-tuning, enabling more effective training across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[LayoutCoT: Unleashing the Deep Reasoning Potential of Large Language Models for Layout Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10829v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional layout generation aims to automatically generate visually appealing and semantically coherent layouts from user-defined constraints. While recent methods based on generative models have shown promising results, they typically require substantial amounts of training data or extensive fine-tuning, limiting their versatility and practical applicability. Alternatively, some training-free approaches leveraging in-context learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged, but they often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities and overly simplistic ranking mechanisms, which restrict their ability to generate consistently high-quality layouts. To this end, we propose LayoutCoT, a novel approach that leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through a combination of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. Specifically, LayoutCoT transforms layout representations into a standardized serialized format suitable for processing by LLMs. A Layout-aware RAG is used to facilitate effective retrieval and generate a coarse layout by LLMs. This preliminary layout, together with the selected exemplars, is then fed into a specially designed CoT reasoning module for iterative refinement, significantly enhancing both semantic coherence and visual quality. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets spanning three conditional layout generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LayoutCoT achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring training or fine-tuning. Notably, our CoT reasoning module enables standard LLMs, even those without explicit deep reasoning abilities, to outperform specialized deep-reasoning models such as deepseek-R1, highlighting the potential of our approach in unleashing the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs for layout generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Large-Scale Channel Sounding for 6G: A Framework for Sparse Sampling and Multipath Component Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05405v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realizing the 6G vision of artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) critically requires large-scale real-world channel datasets for channel modeling and data-driven AI models. However, traditional frequency-domain channel sounding methods suffer from low efficiency due to a prohibitive number of frequency points to avoid delay ambiguity. This paper proposes a novel channel sounding framework involving sparse nonuniform sampling along with a likelihood-rectified space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (LR-SAGE) algorithm for multipath component extraction. This framework enables the acquisition of channel datasets that are tens or even hundreds of times larger within the same channel measurement duration, thereby providing the massive data required to harness the full potential of AI scaling laws. Specifically, we propose a Parabolic Frequency Sampling (PFS) strategy that non-uniformly distributes frequency points, effectively eliminating delay ambiguity while reducing sampling overhead by orders of magnitude. To efficiently extract multipath components (MPCs) from the channel data measured by PFS, we develop a LR-SAGE algorithm, rectifying the likelihood distortion caused by nonuniform sampling and molecular absorption effect. Simulation results and experimental validation at 280--300~GHz confirm that the proposed PFS and LR-SAGE algorithm not only achieve 50$\times$ faster measurement, a 98\% reduction in data volume and a 99.96\% reduction in post-processing computational complexity, but also successfully captures MPCs and channel characteristics consistent with traditional exhaustive measurements, demonstrating its potential as a fundamental enabler for constructing the massive ISAC datasets required by AI-native 6G systems.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The ability to recognise and interpret these flowcharts is in high demand, as they provide valuable insights unavailable in text-only explanations. However, developing VLMs with precise flowchart understanding requires large-scale datasets of flowchart images and corresponding text, the creation of which is highly time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce JSynFlow, a synthesised visual QA dataset for Japanese flowcharts, generated using large language models (LLMs). Our dataset comprises task descriptions for various business occupations, the corresponding flowchart images rendered from domain-specific language (DSL) code, and related QA pairs. This paper details the dataset's synthesis procedure and demonstrates that fine-tuning with JSynFlow significantly improves VLM performance on flowchart-based QA tasks. Our dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jri-advtechlab/jsynflow.</p></details> | 7 pages, 1 figure |

Despite these achievements, their application to finance remains challenging, due to fragmented data sources, intransparent reasoning processes, and weak transferability to business applications. In response, we introduce Fin-R1, a reasoning LLM designed for financial scenarios. With a compact size of 7 billion parameters, Fin-R1 reduces deployment costs while addressing the aforementioned challenges. Its development follows a two-stage pipeline. First, we construct Fin-R1-Data, a high-quality financial dataset consisting of 60,091 chain-of-thought (CoT) samples, distilled and filtered from multiple authoritative benchmarks to ensure consistency and reliability. Second, we train Fin-R1 using Fin-R1-Data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by reinforcement learning (RL). This stage substantially improves the model's ability to solve complex financial reasoning tasks, yielding outputs that are both accurate and interpretable. Despite its relatively small parameter scale, Fin-R1 achieves competitive empirical performance across established financial benchmarks and demonstrates practical utility in compliance checking and robo-advisory. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/SUFE-AIFLM-Lab/Fin-R1, and has already attracted over 700 stars.</p></details> |  |
| **[BadTemplate: A Training-Free Backdoor Attack via Chat Template Against Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05401v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chat template is a common technique used in the training and inference stages of Large Language Models (LLMs). It can transform input and output data into role-based and templated expressions to enhance the performance of LLMs. However, this also creates a breeding ground for novel attack surfaces. In this paper, we first reveal that the customizability of chat templates allows an attacker who controls the template to inject arbitrary strings into the system prompt without the user's notice. Building on this, we propose a training-free backdoor attack, termed BadTemplate. Specifically, BadTemplate inserts carefully crafted malicious instructions into the high-priority system prompt, thereby causing the target LLM to exhibit persistent backdoor behaviors. BadTemplate outperforms traditional backdoor attacks by embedding malicious instructions directly into the system prompt, eliminating the need for model retraining while achieving high attack effectiveness with minimal cost. Furthermore, its simplicity and scalability make it easily and widely deployed in real-world systems, raising serious risks of rapid propagation, economic damage, and large-scale misinformation. Furthermore, detection by major third-party platforms HuggingFace and LLM-as-a-judge proves largely ineffective against BadTemplate. Extensive experiments conducted on 5 benchmark datasets across 6 open-source and 3 closed-source LLMs, compared with 3 baselines, demonstrate that BadTemplate achieves up to a 100% attack success rate and significantly outperforms traditional prompt-based backdoors in both word-level and sentence-level attacks. Our work highlights the potential security risks raised by chat templates in the LLM supply chain, thereby supporting the development of effective defense mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper includes biased content that may be disturbing or offensive to certain readers</p></details> |

However, existing methods either rely on heuristic static filters that ignore training dynamics, or use dynamic yet optimizer-agnostic criteria based on raw gradients. We propose OPUS (Optimizer-induced Projected Utility Selection), a dynamic data selection framework that defines utility in the optimizer-induced update space. OPUS scores candidates by projecting their effective updates, shaped by modern optimizers, onto a target direction derived from a stable, in-distribution proxy. To ensure scalability, we employ Ghost technique with CountSketch for computational efficiency, and Boltzmann sampling for data diversity, incurring only 4.7\% additional compute overhead. OPUS achieves remarkable results across diverse corpora, quality tiers, optimizers, and model scales. In pre-training of GPT-2 Large/XL on FineWeb and FineWeb-Edu with 30B tokens, OPUS outperforms industrial-level baselines and even full 200B-token training. Moreover, when combined with industrial-level static filters, OPUS further improves pre-training efficiency, even with lower-quality data. Furthermore, in continued pre-training of Qwen3-8B-Base on SciencePedia, OPUS achieves superior performance using only 0.5B tokens compared to full training with 3B tokens, demonstrating significant data efficiency gains in specialized domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Although current methods perform well on benchmarks like BIRD and Spider, they struggle with complex reasoning, domain knowledge, and hypothetical queries, and remain costly in enterprise deployment. To address these issues, we propose a framework named IESR(Information Enhanced Structured Reasoning) for lightweight large language models: (i) leverages LLMs for key information understanding and schema linking, and decoupling mathematical computation and SQL generation, (ii) integrates a multi-path reasoning mechanism based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with majority voting, and (iii) introduces a trajectory consistency verification module with a discriminator model to ensure accuracy and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that IESR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the complex reasoning benchmark LogicCat (24.28 EX) and the Archer dataset (37.28 EX) using only compact lightweight models without fine-tuning. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that current coder models exhibit notable biases and deficiencies in physical knowledge, mathematical computation, and common-sense reasoning, highlighting important directions for future research.

This study evaluated four small medical LLMs Meerkat-7B, BioMistral-7B, OpenBioLLM-8B, and MedLLaMA3-v20 in answering ophthalmology related patient queries and assessed the feasibility of LLM based evaluation against clinician grading. In this cross sectional study, 180 ophthalmology patient queries were answered by each model, generating 2160 responses. Models were selected for parameter sizes under 10 billion to enable resource efficient deployment. Responses were evaluated by three ophthalmologists of differing seniority and by GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E. framework assessing safety, consensus and context, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability, with ratings assigned on a five point Likert scale. Agreement between LLM and clinician grading was assessed using Spearman rank correlation, Kendall tau statistics, and kernel density estimate analyses. Meerkat-7B achieved the highest performance with mean scores of 3.44 from Senior Consultants, 4.08 from Consultants, and 4.18 from Residents. MedLLaMA3-v20 performed poorest, with 25.5 percent of responses containing hallucinations or clinically misleading content, including fabricated terminology. GPT-4-Turbo grading showed strong alignment with clinician assessments overall, with Spearman rho of 0.80 and Kendall tau of 0.67, though Senior Consultants graded more conservatively. Overall, medical LLMs demonstrated potential for safe ophthalmic question answering, but gaps remained in clinical depth and consensus, supporting the feasibility of LLM based evaluation for large scale benchmarking and the need for hybrid automated and clinician review frameworks to guide safe clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |

Yet, these models are often English-centric, limiting their robustness and reliability for linguistically diverse communities. Recent work has highlighted discrepancies in performance in low-resource languages for various medical tasks, but the underlying causes remain poorly understood. In this study, we conduct a cross-lingual empirical analysis of LLM performance on Arabic and English medical question and answering. Our findings reveal a persistent language-driven performance gap that intensifies with increasing task complexity. Tokenization analysis exposes structural fragmentation in Arabic medical text, while reliability analysis suggests that model-reported confidence and explanations exhibit limited correlation with correctness. Together, these findings underscore the need for language-aware design and evaluation strategies in LLMs for medical tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to HeaLing-EACL 2026</p></details> |

This limitation stems from the limited context length and the exorbitant memory footprints required for long-form inference. In this work, we propose Speech-XL, a new model that capitalizes on the intrinsic key-value (KV) sparsification capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve high-ratio speech input compression. Specifically, we introduce a novel special token, the Speech Summarization Token (SST), for each speech interval to encapsulate the intra-interval speech information into its associated KV pairs. The SST module is trained via instruction fine-tuning, employing a curriculum learning strategy where the SST learns to compress information in a progressive manner--advancing from low-ratio (simple) to high-ratio (challenging) compression. Despite utilizing significantly less training data than other baselines, our model achieves highly competitive performance on major benchmarks, including LongSpeech and AUDIOMARATHON. By addressing the long-standing bottlenecks in long-form audio modeling, our approach offers a novel perspective on the condensation of extensive acoustic sequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pattern Enhanced Multi-Turn Jailbreaking: Exploiting Structural Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08859v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints gradually. These attacks target different harm categories through distinct conversational approaches. Existing multi-turn methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation patterns to construct multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue. Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles, defense to one pattern does not generalize to others, and model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA</p></details> |  |

Towards automated attack emulation, this paper defines modular attack actions and a linking model to organize and chain heterogeneous attack tools into causality-preserving cyberattacks. Building on this foundation, we introduce Aurora: an automated cyberattack emulation system powered by symbolic planning and large language models (LLMs). Aurora crafts actionable, causality-preserving attack chains tailored to Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports and target environments, and automatically executes these emulations. Using Aurora, we generated an extensive cyberattack emulation dataset from 250 attack reports, 15 times larger than the leading expert-crafted dataset. Our evaluation shows that Aurora significantly outperforms existing methods in creating actionable, diverse, and realistic attack chains. We release the dataset and use it to evaluate three state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems, whose performance differed notably from results on older datasets, highlighting the need for up-to-date, automated attack emulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author-accepted version of a paper accepted at the Applied Cryptography and Network Security (ACNS 2026)</p></details> |

Small language models (SLMs) are far more efficient, yet struggle on multi-step reasoning tasks. A natural idea is to let a large model guide a small one at inference time as a mentor, yet existing collaboration methods often promote imitation, resulting in verbose reasoning without consistent error correction. We propose MentorCollab, an inference-time collaboration method in which an LRM selectively and sparsely guides an SLM, rather than taking over generation. At randomly sampled token positions, we probe for divergences between the two models and use a lightweight verifier to decide whether the SLM should follow a short lookahead segment from its mentor or continue on its own. Across 15 SLM--LRM pairs and 3 domains (math reasoning, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning), our method improves performance in 12 settings, with average gains of 3.0% and up to 8.0%, while adopting only having 18.4% tokens generated by the expensive mentor model on average. We find that short segments and selective probing are sufficient for effective collaboration.

We propose LeanCode for code simplification to reduce training and prediction time, leveraging code contexts in utilizing attention scores to represent the tokens' importance. We advocate for the selective removal of tokens based on the average context-aware attention scores rather than average scores across all inputs. LeanCode uses the attention scores of `CLS' tokens within the encoder for classification tasks, such as code search. It also employs the encoder-decoder attention scores to determine token significance for sequence-to-sequence tasks like code summarization. Our evaluation shows LeanCode's superiority over the SOTAs DietCode and Slimcode, with improvements of 60% and 16% for code search, and 29% and 27% for code summarization, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main.

| **[Hallucination-Resistant Security Planning with a Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05279v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are promising tools for supporting security management tasks, such as incident response planning. However, their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate remain significant challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold. Moreover, we establish a bound on the regret of ICL under certain assumptions. To evaluate our framework, we apply it to an incident response use case where the goal is to generate a response and recovery plan based on system logs. Experiments on four public datasets show that our framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to frontier LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium 2026.

| **[Mil-SCORE: Benchmarking Long-Context Geospatial Reasoning and Planning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21826v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are applied to increasingly longer and more complex tasks, there is a growing need for realistic long-context benchmarks that require selective reading and integration of heterogeneous, multi-modal information sources. This need is especially acute for geospatial planning problems, such as those found in planning for large-scale military operations, which demand fast and accurate reasoning over maps, orders, intelligence reports, and other distributed data. To address this gap, we present MilSCORE (Military Scenario Contextual Reasoning), to our knowledge the first scenario-level dataset of expert-authored, multi-hop questions grounded in a complex, simulated military planning scenario used for training. MilSCORE is designed to evaluate high-stakes decision-making and planning, probing LLMs' ability to combine tactical and spatial reasoning across multiple sources and to reason over long-horizon, geospatially rich context. The benchmark includes a diverse set of question types across seven categories targeting both factual recall and multi-step reasoning about constraints, strategy, and spatial analysis. We provide an evaluation protocol and report baseline results for a range of contemporary vision-language models. Our findings highlight substantial headroom on MilSCORE, indicating that current systems struggle with realistic, scenario-level long-context planning, and positioning MilSCORE as a challenging testbed for future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[PatchGuru: Patch Oracle Inference from Natural Language Artifacts with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05270v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As software systems evolve, patches may unintentionally alter program behavior. Validating patches against their intended semantics is difficult due to incomplete regression tests and informal, non-executable natural language (NL) descriptions of patch intent. We present PatchGuru, the first automated technique that infers executable patch specifications from real-world pull requests (PRs). Given a PR, PatchGuru uses large language models (LLMs) to extract developer intent from NL artifacts and synthesizes patch oracles: under-approximate yet practical specifications expressed as runtime assertions in comparison programs that integrate pre- and post-patch versions. Patch oracles focus on patch-relevant behaviors, enable automated validation, and support cross-version properties. PatchGuru iteratively refines inferred oracles by comparing pre- and post-patch behaviors, identifies violations, filters inconsistencies via self-review, and generates bug reports. We evaluate PatchGuru on 400 recent PRs from four widely used open-source Python projects. PatchGuru reports 39 warnings with a precision of 0.62, yielding 24 confirmed true positives, including 12 previously unknown bugs, 11 of which were subsequently fixed by developers. Compared to the state-of-the-art technique Testora, PatchGuru detects 17 more bugs (24 vs. 7) while improving precision from 0.32 to 0.62. PatchGuru incurs an average cost of 8.9 minutes and USD 0.07 per PR. These results suggest that PatchGuru complements code review and regression testing by providing executable documentation and automated validation of patch intent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surgery: Mitigating Harmful Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models via Attention Sink](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05228v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Harmful fine-tuning can invalidate safety alignment of large language models, exposing significant safety risks. In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning. Based on this finding, we propose a separable sink divergence hypothesis -- \emph{attention heads associating with learning harmful patterns during fine-tuning are separable by their sign of sink divergence}. Based on the hypothesis, we propose a fine-tuning-stage defense, dubbed Surgery. Surgery utilizes a regularizer for sink divergence suppression, which steers attention heads toward the negative sink divergence group, thereby reducing the model's tendency to learn and amplify harmful patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90\%, 11.25\%, and 9.55\% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

| **[SurgLaVi: Large-Scale Hierarchical Dataset for Surgical Vision-Language Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10555v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language pre-training (VLP) offers unique advantages for surgery by aligning language with surgical videos, enabling workflow understanding and transfer across tasks without relying on expert-labeled datasets. However, progress in surgical VLP remains constrained by the limited scale, procedural diversity, semantic quality, and hierarchical structure of existing datasets. In this work, we present SurgLaVi, the largest and most diverse surgical vision-language dataset to date, comprising nearly 240k clip-caption pairs from more than 200 procedures, and featuring hierarchical levels at coarse-, mid-, and fine-level. At the core of SurgLaVi lies a fully automated pipeline that systematically generates fine-grained transcriptions of surgical videos and segments them into coherent procedural units. To ensure high-quality annotations, it applies dual-modality filtering to remove irrelevant and noisy samples. Within this framework, the resulting captions are enriched with contextual detail, producing annotations that are both semantically rich and easy to interpret. To ensure accessibility, we release SurgLaVi-$\b{eta}$, an open-source derivative of 113k clip-caption pairs constructed entirely from public data, which is over four times larger than existing surgical VLP datasets. To demonstrate the value of the SurgLaVi datasets, we introduce SurgCLIP, a CLIP-style video-text contrastive framework with dual encoders, as a representative base model. SurgCLIP achieves consistent improvements across phase, step, action, and tool recognition, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods, often by large margins. These results validate that large-scale, semantically rich, and hierarchically structured datasets directly translate into stronger and more generalizable representations, establishing SurgLaVi as a key resource for developing surgical foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Large Language Model Behavior with Human Citation Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05205v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most services built on powerful large-scale language models (LLMs) add citations to their output to enhance credibility. Recent research has paid increasing attention to the question of what reference documents to link to outputs. However, how LLMs recognize cite-worthiness and how this process should be controlled remains underexplored. In this study, we focus on what kinds of content LLMs currently tend to cite and how well that behavior aligns with human preferences. We construct a dataset to characterize the relationship between human citation preferences and LLM behavior. Web-derived texts are categorized into eight citation-motivation types, and pairwise citation preferences are exhaustively evaluated across all type combinations to capture fine-grained contrasts. Our results show that humans most frequently seek citations for medical text, and stronger models display a similar tendency. We also find that current models are as much as $27\%$ more likely than humans to add citations to text that is explicitly marked as needing citations on sources such as Wikipedia, and this overemphasis reduces alignment accuracy. Conversely, models systematically underselect numeric sentences (by $-22.6\%$ relative to humans) and sentences containing personal names (by $-20.1\%$), categories for which humans typically demand citations. Furthermore, experiments with Direct Preference Optimization demonstrate that model behavior can be calibrated to better match human citation preferences. We expect this study to provide a foundation for more fine-grained investigations into LLM citation preferences.</p></details> | Work In Progress |
| **[From Sequential to Parallel: Reformulating Dynamic Programming as GPU Kernels for Large-Scale Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05179v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major bottleneck in scenario-based Sample Average Approximation (SAA) for stochastic programming (SP) is the cost of solving an exact second-stage problem for every scenario, especially when each scenario contains an NP-hard combinatorial structure. This has led much of the SP literature to restrict the second stage to linear or simplified models. We develop a GPU-based framework that makes full-fidelity integer second-stage models tractable at scale. The key innovation is a set of hardware-aware, scenario-batched GPU kernels that expose parallelism across scenarios, dynamic-programming (DP) layers, and route or action options, enabling Bellman updates to be executed in a single pass over more than 1,000,000 realizations. We evaluate the approach in two representative SP settings: a vectorized split operator for stochastic vehicle routing and a DP for inventory reinsertion. Implementation scales nearly linearly in the number of scenarios and achieves a one-two to four-five orders of magnitude speedup, allowing far larger scenario sets and reliably stronger first-stage decisions. The computational leverage directly improves decision quality: much larger scenario sets and many more first-stage candidates can be evaluated within fixed time budgets, consistently yielding stronger SAA solutions. Our results show that full-fidelity integer second-stage models are tractable at scales previously considered impossible, providing a practical path to large-scale, realistic stochastic discrete optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoSA: Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05148v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a practical paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) without updating all parameters. Most existing approaches, such as LoRA and PiSSA, rely on low-rank decompositions of weight updates. However, the low-rank assumption may restrict expressivity, particularly in task-specific adaptation scenarios where singular values are distributed relatively uniformly. To address this limitation, we propose CoSA (Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation), a new PEFT method extended from compressed sensing theory. Instead of constraining weight updates to a low-rank subspace, CoSA expresses them through fixed random projection matrices and a compact learnable core. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of CoSA as a synthesis process, proving that weight updates can be compactly encoded into a low-dimensional space and mapped back through random projections. Extensive experimental results show that CoSA provides a principled perspective for efficient and expressive multi-scale model adaptation. Specifically, we evaluate CoSA on 10 diverse tasks, including natural language understanding and generation, employing 5 models of different scales from RoBERTa, Llama, and Qwen families. Across these settings, CoSA consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual concept ranking uncovers medical shortcuts used by large multimodal models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05096v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the reliability of machine learning models in safety-critical domains such as healthcare requires auditing methods that can uncover model shortcomings. We introduce a method for identifying important visual concepts within large multimodal models (LMMs) and use it to investigate the behaviors these models exhibit when prompted with medical tasks. We primarily focus on the task of classifying malignant skin lesions from clinical dermatology images, with supplemental experiments including both chest radiographs and natural images. After showing how LMMs display unexpected gaps in performance between different demographic subgroups when prompted with demonstrating examples, we apply our method, Visual Concept Ranking (VCR), to these models and prompts. VCR generates hypotheses related to different visual feature dependencies, which we are then able to validate with manual interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-Ensemble Simulations Reveal Links Between Atmospheric Blocking Frequency and Sea Surface Temperature Variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05083v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Atmospheric blocking events drive persistent weather extremes in midlatitudes, but isolating the influence of sea surface temperature (SST) from chaotic internal atmospheric variability on these events remains a challenge. We address this challenge using century-long (1900-2010), large-ensemble simulations with two computationally efficient deep-learning general circulation models. We find these models skillfully reproduce the observed blocking climatology, matching or exceeding the performance of a traditional high-resolution model and representative CMIP6 models. Averaging the large ensembles filters internal atmospheric noise to isolate the SST-forced component of blocking variability, yielding substantially higher correlations with reanalysis than for individual ensemble members. We identify robust teleconnections linking Greenland blocking frequency to North Atlantic SST and El Niño-like patterns. Furthermore, SST-forced trends in blocking frequency show a consistent decline in winter over Greenland, and an increase over Europe. These results demonstrate that SST variability exerts a significant and physically interpretable influence on blocking frequency and establishes large ensembles from deep learning models as a powerful tool for separating forced SST signals from internal noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05073v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs) is a key building block for safety guardrails of daily LLM applications. Yet, even as LLM agents are increasingly deployed in highly complex tasks, most UQ research still centers on single-turn question-answering. We argue that UQ research must shift to realistic settings with interactive agents, and that a new principled framework for agent UQ is needed. This paper presents the first general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes broad classes of existing UQ setups. Under this formulation, we show that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, a viewpoint that breaks down for interactive agents in an open world. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective, a conditional uncertainty reduction process, that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by highlighting "interactivity" of actions. From this perspective, we outline a conceptual framework to provide actionable guidance for designing UQ in LLM agent setups. Finally, we conclude with practical implications of the agent UQ in frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications, as well as open remaining problems.</p></details> |  |

Extreme solar events can cause substantial economic damage with limited advance warning, underscoring the importance of early-warning systems, accurate forecasting, and effective education in space science. Although large language models (LLMs) perform well on general tasks, they often lack domain-specific knowledge and pedagogical capability to clearly explain complex space science concepts. We introduce SolarGPT-QA, a question answering system based on a domain-adapted large language model built on the LLaMA-3 base model. The model is trained using scientific literature and large-scale question-answer data generated with GPT-4 and refined using Grok-3 in a student-friendly storytelling style. Human pairwise evaluations show that SolarGPT-QA outperforms general-purpose models in zero-shot settings and achieves competitive performance compared to instruction-tuned models for educational explanations in space weather and heliophysics. A small pilot student comprehension study further suggests improved clarity and accessibility of the generated explanations. Ablation experiments indicate that combining domain-adaptive pretraining with pedagogical fine-tuning is important for balancing scientific accuracy and educational effectiveness. This work represents an initial step toward a broader SolarGPT framework for space science education and forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is preliminary work towards a broader SolarGPT framework</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Models on Solved and Unsolved Problems in Graph Theory: Implications for Computing Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05059v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models are increasingly used by students to explore advanced material in computer science, including graph theory. As these tools become integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework, it is important to understand how reliably they support mathematically rigorous thinking. This study examines the performance of a LLM on two related graph theoretic problems: a solved problem concerning the gracefulness of line graphs and an open problem for which no solution is currently known. We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction. The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims. These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning. For computing education, this distinction highlights the importance of guiding students to use LLMs for conceptual exploration while relying on independent verification and rigorous argumentation for formal problem solving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Pyramid Network for Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20322v3)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various vision-language (VL) tasks, but their expensive computations still limit the real-world application. To address this issue, recent efforts aim to compress the visual features to save the computational costs of MLLMs. However, direct visual compression methods, e.g. efficient projectors, inevitably destroy the visual semantics in MLLM, especially in difficult samples. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel dynamic pyramid network (DPN) for efficient MLLMs. Specifically, DPN formulates MLLM as a hierarchical structure where visual features are gradually compressed with increasing depth. In this case, even with a high compression ratio, fine-grained visual information can still be perceived in shallow layers. To maximize the benefit of DPN, we further propose an innovative Dynamic Pooling Experts (DPE) that can dynamically choose the optimal visual compression rate according to input features. With this design, harder samples will be assigned larger computations, thus preserving the model performance. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on two popular MLLMs and ten benchmarks. Experimental results show that DPN can save up to 56% average FLOPs on LLaVA while further achieving +0.74% performance gains. Besides, the generalization ability of DPN is also validated on the existing high-resolution MLLM called LLaVA-HR. The source code will be released at https://github.com/aihao2000/DPN-LLaVA.</p></details> |  |

However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be released soon</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Code Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models Under Real-World Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14917v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code reasoning tasks are becoming prevalent in large language model (LLM) assessments. Yet, there is a dearth of studies on the impact of real-world complexities on code reasoning, e.g., inter- or intra-procedural dependencies, API calls, deeply nested constructs, and non-primitive complex types. Evaluating LLMs under such a simplistic setting poses a significant threat to assumptions about their generalizability in practice. To enable a more realistic evaluation of code reasoning, we construct a dataset of 1200 reasoning problems from two sources: existing code reasoning benchmarks and popular GitHub Python repositories. Our pipeline leverages static and dynamic program analysis to automatically serialize/deserialize compound, complex, and custom types galore in real-world code, going far beyond only primitive types used in prior studies. A key feature of our dataset is categorizing each reasoning problem as Lower Complexity (LC) or Higher Complexity (HC) via a principled majority-vote mechanism over nine diverse and interpretable code-complexity metrics, yielding two well-separated, semantically meaningful categories of problem difficulty suitable for precise calibration of LLM reasoning ability. This categorization shows that the problems used in existing code-reasoning evaluation mostly belong to the LC category, failing to represent real-world complexity.</p></details> |  |

We show that identity information is already present in tabular representations (fiducial features): even a simple MLP-based embedding network yields non-trivial performance, establishing a strong baseline before waveform modeling. We then adopt embedding-based deep learning models (ArcFace), first on features and then on ECG waveforms, showing a clear performance jump when moving from tabular inputs to waveforms, and a further gain with larger training sets and consistent normalization across train/val/test. On a large-scale test set, verification achieves high TAR at strict FAR thresholds (TAR=0.908 @ FAR=1e-3; TAR=0.820 @ FAR=1e-4) with EER=2.53\% (all-vs-all); closed-set identification yields Rank@1=0.812 and Rank@10=0.910. In open-set, a two-stage pipeline (top-$K$ shortlist on embeddings + re-ranking) reaches DIR@FAR up to 0.976 at FAR=1e-3 and 1e-4. Overall, the results show that ECG carries a measurable individual signature and that large-scale testing is essential to obtain realistic, comparable metrics. The study provides an operationally grounded benchmark that helps standardize evaluation across protocols.</p></details> |  |

We present LALM-as-a-Judge, the first controlled benchmark and systematic study of large audio-language models (LALMs) as safety judges for multi-turn spoken dialogues. We generate 24,000 unsafe and synthetic spoken dialogues in English that consist of 3-10 turns, by having a single dialogue turn including content with one of 8 harmful categories (e.g., violence) and on one of 5 grades, from very mild to severe. On 160 dialogues, 5 human raters confirmed reliable unsafe detection and a meaningful severity scale. We benchmark three open-source LALMs: Qwen2-Audio, Audio Flamingo 3, and MERaLiON as zero-shot judges that output a scalar safety score in [0,1] across audio-only, transcription-only, or multimodal inputs, along with a transcription-only LLaMA baseline. We measure the judges' sensitivity to detecting unsafe content, the specificity in ordering severity levels, and the stability of the score in dialogue turns. Results reveal architecture- and modality-dependent trade-offs: the most sensitive judge is also the least stable across turns, while stable configurations sacrifice detection of mild harmful content. Transcription quality is a key bottleneck: Whisper-Large may significantly reduce sensitivity for transcription-only modes, while largely preserving severity ordering. Audio becomes crucial when paralinguistic cues or transcription fidelity are category-critical. We summarize all findings and provide actionable guidance for practitioners.</p></details> |  |

We investigate oblivious load-balancing schemes for a $N\times N$ torus network under sparse traffic where there are at most $k$ active source-destination pairs. We are motivated by the problem of load-balancing in large-scale LEO satellite networks, which can be modelled as a torus, where the traffic is known to be sparse and localized to certain hotspot areas. We formulate the problem as a linear program and show that no oblivious routing scheme can achieve a worst-case load lower than approximately $\frac{\sqrt{2k}}{4}$ when $1<k \leq N^2/2$ and $\frac{N}{4}$ when $N^2/2\leq k\leq N^2$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the celebrated Valiant Load Balancing scheme is suboptimal under sparse traffic and construct an optimal oblivious load-balancing scheme that achieves the lower bound. Further, we discover a $\sqrt{2}$ multiplicative gap between the worst-case load of a non-oblivious routing and the worst-case load of any oblivious routing. The results can also be extended to general $N\times M$ tori with unequal link capacities along the vertical and horizontal directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in IEEE INFOCOM 2026</p></details> |

While many LLMs undergo post-training alignment and safety procedures to avoid expressions of explicit social bias, they still exhibit significant implicit biases on indirect tasks resembling the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Recent work has further shown that inference-time reasoning can impair LLM performance on tasks that rely on implicit statistical learning. Motivated by a theoretical link between implicit associations and statistical learning in human cognition, we examine how reasoning-enabled inference affects implicit bias in LLMs. We find that enabling reasoning significantly reduces measured implicit bias on an IAT-style evaluation for some model classes across fifteen stereotype topics. This effect appears specific to social bias domains, as we observe no corresponding reduction for non-social implicit associations. As reasoning is increasingly enabled by default in deployed LLMs, these findings suggest that it can meaningfully alter fairness evaluation outcomes in some systems, while also raising questions about how alignment procedures interact with inference-time reasoning to drive variation in bias reduction across model types. More broadly, this work highlights how theory from cognitive science and psychology can complement AI evaluation research by providing methodological and interpretive frameworks that reveal new insights into model behavior.</p></details> |  |

| **[Benchmarking Large Language Models for Diagnosing Students' Cognitive Skills from Handwritten Math Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00843v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Students' handwritten math work provides a rich resource for diagnosing cognitive skills, as it captures intermediate reasoning beyond final answers. We investigate how current large language models (LLMs) perform in diagnosing cognitive skills from such work. However, student responses vary widely, often omitting steps or providing only vague, contextually implicit evidence. Despite recent advances in LLMs' multimodal and reasoning capabilities, their performance under such conditions remains underexplored. To address this gap, we constructed MathCog, a benchmark dataset containing 3,036 diagnostic verdicts across 639 student responses to 110 math problems, annotated by teachers using TIMSS-grounded cognitive skill checklists with evidential strength labels (Evident/Vague). Evaluating 18 LLMs, we find that (1) all models underperform (F1 < 0.5) regardless of capability, and (2) performance degrades sharply under vague evidence. Error analysis reveals systematic patterns: models frequently misattribute Vague evidence as Evident, overthink minimal cues, and hallucinate nonexistent evidence. We discuss implications for evidence-aware, teacher-in-the-loop designs for LLM-based cognitive diagnosis in educational settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Subnetwork Enhancement for Underrepresented Languages in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13580v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit substantial performance disparities across languages, particularly between high- and low-resource settings. We propose a framework for improving performance in underrepresented languages while preserving general-purpose capabilities via targeted fine-tuning of sparse, language-associated subnetworks. Our approach identifies language-relevant neurons using Language Activation Probability Entropy (LAPE), an information-theoretic metric that reliably captures language-specific activation patterns, and fine-tunes only the corresponding weights. Experiments on Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-Nemo-12B, and Aya-Expanse-8B across 12 mid- and low-resource languages show that our method consistently outperforms full fine-tuning, FFN-only fine-tuning, LoRA, IA^3, and random-subset baselines while updating only 0.2-1% of model parameters. We further show that sparse, neuron-targeted fine-tuning can inject new language capabilities without catastrophic forgetting, with potential applicability to other model capabilities. Mechanistic analyses of weight updates and internal representations reveal asymmetric roles of FFN projections in language adaptation and improved cross-lingual alignment. Finally, we release language neuron sets for over 100 languages together with our adaptation pipeline, enabling a cost-effective path for extending LLMs to underrepresented languages.</p></details> | preprint |

While the latter can be described as a graph structure and can be handled by a range of established algorithms for classification and prediction, the former has recently gained new potential through the use of LLM embedding models. Demonstrating these possibilities and their practicability, we investigate the Web of Science dataset, containing ~56 million scientific publications through the lens of our proposed embedding method, revealing a self-structured landscape of texts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Focus-LIME: Surgical Interpretation of Long-Context Large Language Models via Proxy-Based Neighborhood Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04607v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to handle massive context windows, achieving surgical feature-level interpretation is essential for high-stakes tasks like legal auditing and code debugging. However, existing local model-agnostic explanation methods face a critical dilemma in these scenarios: feature-based methods suffer from attribution dilution due to high feature dimensionality, thus failing to provide faithful explanations. In this paper, we propose Focus-LIME, a coarse-to-fine framework designed to restore the tractability of surgical interpretation. Focus-LIME utilizes a proxy model to curate the perturbation neighborhood, allowing the target model to perform fine-grained attribution exclusively within the optimized context. Empirical evaluations on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that our method makes surgical explanations practicable and provides faithful explanations to users.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are often confined in limited types of sensing behaviors, restricting their applicability to complex environments. In this work, we formalize active perception as a non-Markovian process driven by information gain and decision branching, providing a structured categorization of visual active perception paradigms. Building on this perspective, we introduce CoMe-VLA, a cognitive and memory-aware vision-language-action (VLA) framework that leverages large-scale human egocentric data to learn versatile exploration and manipulation priors. Our framework integrates a cognitive auxiliary head for autonomous sub-task transitions and a dual-track memory system to maintain consistent self and environmental awareness by fusing proprioceptive and visual temporal contexts. By aligning human and robot hand-eye coordination behaviors in a unified egocentric action space, we train the model progressively in three stages. Extensive experiments on a wheel-based humanoid have demonstrated strong robustness and adaptability of our proposed method across diverse long-horizon tasks spanning multiple active perception scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[PersoBench: Benchmarking Personalized Response Generation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03198v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive conversational capabilities, their proficiency in delivering personalized responses remains unclear. Although recent benchmarks automatically evaluate persona consistency in role-playing contexts using LLM-based judgment, the evaluation of personalization in response generation remains underexplored. To address this gap, we present an automated benchmarking pipeline, PersoBench, to evaluate the personalization ability of LLMs in persona-aware dialogue generation within a zero-shot setting. Our framework employs a structured pipeline comprising speaker-aware annotation, task-specific and context-driven prompt construction, response post-processing, and automated evaluation across multiple dimensions of generation quality. In particular, the pipeline performs text preprocessing and speaker labeling, constructs structured prompts with task instructions and LLM roles, validates response format, and evaluates valid outputs across fluency, personalization, diversity, and coherence. We assess the performance of four open-source and four closed-source LLMs using well-known datasets and a range of explicit metrics. Our findings reveal that while LLMs excel at generating fluent and diverse responses, they are far from satisfactory in delivering personalized and coherent responses, considering both the conversation context and the provided personas.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce the VK Large Short-Video Dataset (VK-LSVD), the largest publicly available industrial dataset of its kind. VK-LSVD offers an unprecedented scale of over 40 billion interactions from 10 million users and almost 20 million videos over six months, alongside rich features including content embeddings, diverse feedback signals, and contextual metadata. Our analysis supports the dataset's quality and diversity. The dataset's immediate impact is confirmed by its central role in the live VK RecSys Challenge 2025. VK-LSVD provides a vital, open dataset to use in building realistic benchmarks to accelerate research in sequential recommendation, cold-start scenarios, and next-generation recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The ACM Web Conference 2026 (WWW '26).

However, such adaptation often leads to a degradation in generalization on pretrained tasks, a phenomenon known as Catastrophic Forgetting. Existing methods that aim to mitigate this issue either become ineffective when fine-tuning deeper layers of the language decoder or scale poorly with increasing model size. To address these limitations, we propose Model-Dowser, a novel sparse fine-tuning approach for MLLMs. Model-Dowser measures a principled importance score for each model parameter with respect to pretrained generalization (prior to downstream adaptation) by jointly considering weight magnitudes, input activations, and output sensitivities. During fine-tuning, Model-Dowser selectively preserves high-importance parameters and updates the remaining. Comprehensive experiments on two representative MLLMs, LLaVA and NVILA, demonstrate that Model-Dowser effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and consistently outperforms prior methods, while remaining resource-efficient and scalable to multi-billion-parameter models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model as Meta-Surrogate for Data-Driven Many-Task Optimization: A Proof-of-Principle Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08301v3)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many-task optimization scenarios, surrogate models are valuable for mitigating the computational burden of repeated fitness evaluations across tasks. This study proposes a novel meta-surrogate framework to assist many-task optimization, by leveraging the knowledge transfer strengths and emergent capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We formulate a unified framework for many-task fitness prediction, by defining a universal model with metadata to fit a group of problems. Fitness prediction is performed on metadata and decision variables, enabling efficient knowledge sharing across tasks and adaptability to new tasks. The LLM-based meta-surrogate treats fitness prediction as conditional probability estimation, employing a unified token sequence representation for task metadata, inputs, and outputs. This approach facilitates efficient inter-task knowledge sharing through shared token embeddings and captures complex task dependencies via multi-task model training. Experimental results demonstrate the model's emergent generalization ability, including zero-shot performance on problems with unseen dimensions. When integrated into evolutionary transfer optimization (ETO), our framework supports dual-level knowledge transfer -- at both the surrogate and individual levels -- enhancing optimization efficiency and robustness. This work establishes a novel foundation for applying LLMs in surrogate modeling, offering a versatile solution for many-task optimization.</p></details> | 39 pages |

We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework that probes fine-grained clinical understanding through controlled counterfactuals. Using intensive care unit (ICU) discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, we construct both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) variants with single-variable perturbations in demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate eight LLMs, spanning general-purpose and medical variants, under zero-shot setting. Model behavior is analyzed through (1) input-level sensitivity, capturing how counterfactuals alter perplexity, and (2) downstream reasoning, measuring their effect on predicted ICU length-of-stay and mortality. Overall, our results show that standard task metrics obscure clinically relevant differences in model behavior, with models differing substantially in how consistently and proportionally they adjust predictions to counterfactual perturbations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-aligned Latent Reasoning for Multi-modal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04476v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse understanding tasks, these models struggle to solve problems which require extensive multi-step reasoning. This is primarily due to the progressive dilution of visual information during long-context generation, which hinders their ability to fully exploit test-time scaling. To address this issue, we introduce Vision-aligned Latent Reasoning (VaLR), a simple, yet effective reasoning framework that dynamically generates vision-aligned latent tokens before each Chain of Thought reasoning step, guiding the model to reason based on perceptual cues in the latent space. Specifically, VaLR is trained to preserve visual knowledge during reasoning by aligning intermediate embeddings of MLLM with those from vision encoders. Empirical results demonstrate that VaLR consistently outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks requiring long-context understanding or precise visual perception, while exhibiting test-time scaling behavior not observed in prior MLLMs. In particular, VaLR improves the performance significantly from 33.0% to 52.9% on VSI-Bench, achieving a 19.9%p gain over Qwen2.5-VL.</p></details> | 18 pages; 5 figures |

Yet progress toward general point tracking remains constrained by limited high-quality data, as existing datasets often provide insufficient diversity and imperfect trajectory annotations. To this end, we introduce SynthVerse, a large-scale, diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for point tracking. SynthVerse includes several new domains and object types missing from existing synthetic datasets, such as animated-film-style content, embodied manipulation, scene navigation, and articulated objects. SynthVerse substantially expands dataset diversity by covering a broader range of object categories and providing high-quality dynamic motions and interactions, enabling more robust training and evaluation for general point tracking. In addition, we establish a highly diverse point tracking benchmark to systematically evaluate state-of-the-art methods under broader domain shifts. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that training with SynthVerse yields consistent improvements in generalization and reveal limitations of existing trackers under diverse settings.</p></details> |  |

Using a unified framework combining geometric analysis with mechanistic intervention, we demonstrate that late-layer representations implement a structured geometric code that enables selective causal control over token prediction. Specifically, angular organization of the representation geometry parametrizes prediction distributional similarity, while representation norms encode context-specific information that does not determine prediction. Together, these results provide a mechanistic-geometric account of the dynamics of transforming context into predictions in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Drawing from 22.7 million Q&A pairs extracted from S&P Capital IQ transcripts, we construct a rigorously filtered dataset and introduce a three-level evasion taxonomy: direct, intermediate, and fully evasive. Our annotation pipeline employs a Multi-Model Consensus (MMC) framework, combining dual frontier LLM annotation with a three-judge majority voting mechanism for ambiguous cases, achieving a Cohen's Kappa of 0.835 on human inter-annotator agreement.

| **[Bi-directional Bias Attribution: Debiasing Large Language Models without Modifying Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04398v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their outputs often exhibit social biases, raising fairness concerns. Existing debiasing methods, such as fine-tuning on additional datasets or prompt engineering, face scalability issues or compromise user experience in multi-turn interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for detecting stereotype-inducing words and attributing neuron-level bias in LLMs, without the need for fine-tuning or prompt modification. Our framework first identifies stereotype-inducing adjectives and nouns via comparative analysis across demographic groups. We then attribute biased behavior to specific neurons using two attribution strategies based on integrated gradients. Finally, we mitigate bias by directly intervening on their activations at the projection layer. Experiments on three widely used LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces bias while preserving overall model performance. Code is available at the github link: https://github.com/XMUDeepLIT/Bi-directional-Bias-Attribution.</p></details> |  |

However, these systems are trained on large text corpora that encode existing biases, including sex disparities in diagnosis and treatment, raising concerns that such patterns may be reproduced or amplified. We systematically examined whether contemporary LLMs exhibit sex-specific biases in clinical reasoning and how model configuration influences these behaviours. We conducted three experiments using 50 clinician-authored vignettes spanning 44 specialties in which sex was non-informative to the initial diagnostic pathway. Four general-purpose LLMs (ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini), Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash and DeepSeekchat). All models demonstrated significant sex-assignment skew, with predicted sex differing by model. At temperature 0.5, ChatGPT assigned female sex in 70% of cases (95% CI 0.66-0.75), DeepSeek in 61% (0.57-0.65) and Claude in 59% (0.55-0.63), whereas Gemini showed a male skew, assigning a female sex in 36% of cases (0.32-0.41). Contemporary LLMs exhibit stable, model-specific sex biases in clinical reasoning. Permitting abstention reduces explicit labelling but does not eliminate downstream diagnostic differences. Safe clinical integration requires conservative and documented configuration, specialty-level clinical data auditing, and continued human oversight when deploying general-purpose models in healthcare settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-scale hypergraph meets LLMs: Aligning large language models for time series analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04369v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been great success in leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series analysis. The core idea lies in effectively aligning the modality between natural language and time series. However, the multi-scale structures of natural language and time series have not been fully considered, resulting in insufficient utilization of LLMs capabilities. To this end, we propose MSH-LLM, a Multi-Scale Hypergraph method that aligns Large Language Models for time series analysis. Specifically, a hyperedging mechanism is designed to enhance the multi-scale semantic information of time series semantic space. Then, a cross-modality alignment (CMA) module is introduced to align the modality between natural language and time series at different scales. In addition, a mixture of prompts (MoP) mechanism is introduced to provide contextual information and enhance the ability of LLMs to understand the multi-scale temporal patterns of time series. Experimental results on 27 real-world datasets across 5 different applications demonstrate that MSH-LLM achieves the state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2026 |

However, full-set fine-tuning MLLMs to assess such gains incurs significant time costs, hindering the iterative refinement cycles of the ChartU dataset. Reviewing the ChartU dataset synthesis and data selection domains, we find that subsets can potentially probe the MLLMs' capability gains from full-set fine-tuning. Given that data diversity is vital for boosting MLLMs' performance and entropy reflects this feature, we propose EXaMCaP, which uses entropy gain maximization to select a subset. To obtain a high-diversity subset, EXaMCaP chooses the maximum-entropy subset from the large ChartU dataset. As enumerating all possible subsets is impractical, EXaMCaP iteratively selects samples to maximize the gain in set entropy relative to the current set, approximating the maximum-entropy subset of the full dataset. Experiments show that EXaMCaP outperforms baselines in probing the capability gains of the ChartU training set, along with its strong effectiveness across diverse subset sizes and compatibility with various MLLM architectures.</p></details> |  |

Despite this potential, organizations face substantial challenges in assessing the risks associated with LLM use, resulting in inconsistent integration, unknown failure modes, and limited scalability. This paper introduces the LLM Risk Assessment Framework (LRF), a structured approach for evaluating the application of LLMs within Systems Engineering (SE) environments. The framework classifies LLM-based applications along two fundamental dimensions: autonomy, ranging from supportive assistance to fully automated decision making, and impact, reflecting the potential severity of incorrect or misleading model outputs on engineering processes and system elements. By combining these dimensions, the LRF enables consistent determination of corresponding risk levels across the development lifecycle. The resulting classification supports organizations in identifying appropriate validation strategies, levels of human oversight, and required countermeasures to ensure safe and transparent deployment. The framework thereby helps align the rapid evolution of AI technologies with established engineering principles of reliability, traceability, and controlled process integration. Overall, the LRF provides a basis for risk-aware adoption of LLMs in complex engineering environments and represents a first step toward standardized AI assurance practices in systems engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE SysCon 2026</p></details> |

Stage-wise Attention-Guided Adversarial Attack on Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04356v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks against Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are crucial for exposing safety vulnerabilities in modern multimodal systems. Recent attacks based on input transformations, such as random cropping, suggest that spatially localized perturbations can be more effective than global image manipulation. However, randomly cropping the entire image is inherently stochastic and fails to use the limited per-pixel perturbation budget efficiently. We make two key observations: (i) regional attention scores are positively correlated with adversarial loss sensitivity, and (ii) attacking high-attention regions induces a structured redistribution of attention toward subsequent salient regions. Based on these findings, we propose Stage-wise Attention-Guided Attack (SAGA), an attention-guided framework that progressively concentrates perturbations on high-attention regions. SAGA enables more efficient use of constrained perturbation budgets, producing highly imperceptible adversarial examples while consistently achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates across ten LVLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/jackwaky/SAGA.</p></details> | Pre-print |

Given that the latter can encompass higher technology readiness levels, which typically correlates with lower academic impact, it is interesting to understand how academic impact holds up in SFI funded research. Here we decompose SFI \textit{Investigator Awards} - arguably the most academic funding call - into $3,243$ constituent publications and field weighted citation impact (FWCI) values searchable in the SCOPUS database. Given that citation counts are skewed, we highlight the limitation of FWCI as a paper metric, which naively restricts one to comparisons of average FWCI ($\overline{\mathrm{FWCI}}$) in large samples. Neglecting publications with $\textrm{FWCI} < 0.1$ ($8.8\%$), SFI funded publications are well approximated by a lognormal distribution with $μ= -0.0761^{+0.017}_{-0.0039}$ and $ σ= 0.933^{+0.011}_{-0.012}$ at $95 \%$ confidence level. This equates to an $\overline{\mathrm{FWCI}} = 1.433^{+0.029}_{-0.015}$ well above $\overline{\mathrm{FWCI}}=1$ internationally. Broken down by award, we correct $\overline{\mathrm{FWCI}}$ for small samples using simulations and find $\sim 67\%$ exceed \textit{median} international academic interest, thus exhibiting a positive correlation between the potential for socioeconomic impact and academic interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, comments welcome</p></details> |

We introduce GOQ, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the geometric reasoning capabilities of vision and vision-language foundation models. GIQ comprises synthetic and real-world images and corresponding 3D meshes of diverse polyhedra covering varying levels of complexity and symmetry, from Platonic, Archimedean, Johnson, and Catalan solids to stellations and compound shapes. Through systematic experiments involving monocular 3D reconstruction, 3D symmetry detection, mental rotation tests, and zero-shot shape classification tasks, we reveal significant shortcomings in current models. State-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms trained on extensive 3D datasets struggle to reconstruct even basic geometric Platonic solids accurately. Next, although foundation models may be shown via linear and non-linear probing to capture specific 3D symmetry elements, they falter significantly in tasks requiring detailed geometric differentiation, such as mental rotation. Moreover, advanced vision-language assistants such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Claud exhibit remarkably low accuracy in interpreting basic shape properties such as face geometry, convexity, and compound structures of complex polyhedra. GIQ is publicly available at toomanymatts.github.io/giq-benchmark/, providing a structured platform to benchmark critical gaps in geometric intelligence and facilitate future progress in robust, geometry-aware representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026.

These analyses rest on the assumption that citation decisions by authors are accurate, representing the flow of knowledge from cited to citing papers. However, in practice, researchers often cite for reasons that are not related to the fact that there has been (intellectual) input from previous papers. Citations made for rhetorical reasons or without reading the cited work compromise the value of citations as instrument for research evaluation. Past research on threats to the accuracy of citations has mainly focused on citation bias as the primary concern. In this paper, we argue that citation noise - the undesirable variance in citation decisions - represents an equally critical but underexplored challenge in citation analysis. We define and differentiate two types of citation noise: citation level noise and citation pattern noise. Each type of noise is described in terms of how it arises and the specific ways it can undermine the validity of citation-based research assessments. By conceptually differing citation noise from citation accuracy and citation bias, we propose a framework for the foundation of citation analysis. We discuss strategies and interventions to minimize citation noise, aiming to improve the reliability and validity of citation analysis in research evaluation. We recommend that the current professional reform movement in research evaluation such as the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA) pick up these strategies and interventions as an additional building block for careful, responsible use of bibliometric indicators in research evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[EEG Foundation Models: Progresses, Benchmarking, and Open Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17883v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), aiming to learn transferable neural representations from large-scale heterogeneous recordings. Despite rapid progresses, there lacks fair and comprehensive comparisons of existing EEG foundation models, due to inconsistent pre-training objectives, preprocessing choices, and downstream evaluation protocols. This paper fills this gap. We first review 50 representative models and organize their design choices into a unified taxonomic framework including data standardization, model architectures, and self-supervised pre-training strategies. We then evaluate 12 open-source foundation models and competitive specialist baselines across 13 EEG datasets spanning nine BCI paradigms. Emphasizing real-world deployments, we consider both cross-subject generalization under a leave-one-subject-out protocol and rapid calibration under a within-subject few-shot setting. We further compare full-parameter fine-tuning with linear probing to assess the transferability of pre-trained representations, and examine the relationship between model scale and downstream performance. Our results indicate that: 1) linear probing is frequently insufficient; 2) specialist models trained from scratch remain competitive across many tasks; and, 3) larger foundation models do not necessarily yield better generalization performance under current data regimes and training practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-End Compression for Tabular Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05649v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long-standing dominance of gradient-boosted decision trees for tabular data has recently been challenged by in-context learning tabular foundation models. In-context learning methods fit and predict in one forward pass without parameter updates by leveraging the training data as context for predicting on query test points. While recent tabular foundation models achieve state-of-the-art performance, their transformer architecture based on the attention mechanism has quadratic complexity regarding dataset size, which in turn increases the overhead on training and inference time, and limits the capacity of the models to handle large-scale datasets. In this work, we propose TACO, an end-to-end tabular compression model that compresses the training dataset in a latent space. We test our method on the TabArena benchmark, where our proposed method is up to 94x faster in inference time, while consuming up to 97\% less memory compared to the state-of-the-art tabular transformer architecture, all while retaining performance without significant degradation.

We present UniSurg, a video-native foundation model that shifts the learning paradigm from pixel-level reconstruction to latent motion prediction. Built on the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), UniSurg introduces three key technical innovations tailored to surgical videos: 1) motion-guided latent prediction to prioritize semantically meaningful regions, 2) spatiotemporal affinity self-distillation to enforce relational consistency, and 3) feature diversity regularization to prevent representation collapse in texture-sparse surgical scenes. To enable large-scale pretraining, we curate UniSurg-15M, the largest surgical video dataset to date, comprising 3,658 hours of video from 50 sources across 13 anatomical regions. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks demonstrate that UniSurg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on surgical workflow recognition (+14.6% F1 on EgoSurgery, +10.3% on PitVis), action triplet recognition (39.54% mAP-IVT on CholecT50), skill assessment, polyp segmentation, and depth estimation. These results establish UniSurg as a new standard for universal, motion-oriented surgical video understanding.</p></details> |  |

Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) provide the needed interpretability through their additive structure, but traditional GAM methods rely on iterative learning algorithms (such as splines, boosted trees, or neural networks) that are fundamentally incompatible with the in-context learning paradigm of foundation models. In this paper, we introduce GAMformer, the first tabular foundation model for GAMs that bridges the gap between the power of foundation models and the interpretability requirements of critical real-world applications. GAMformer estimates GAM shape functions in a single forward pass using in-context learning, representing a significant departure from conventional iterative approaches. Building on previous research on tabular foundation models, we train GAMformer exclusively on synthetically generated tables to prevent data leakage. Our experiments demonstrate that GAMformer performs comparably to other leading GAMs across various classification benchmarks.</p></details> | 22 pages, 15 figures |

In this work, we systematically evaluate histopathological foundation models for regression-based tasks, demonstrated through the prediction of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score - a critical biomarker for personalized cancer treatment. Within multiple instance learning frameworks, we extract patch-level features from whole slide images (WSI) using five state-of-the-art foundation models, and evaluate their impact compared to contrastive learning-based features. Models are trained to predict continuous HRD scores based on these extracted features across breast, endometrial, and lung cancer cohorts from two public medical data collections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on foundation model features consistently outperform the baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities while exhibiting systematic differences among the foundation models. Additionally, we propose a distribution-based upsampling strategy to mitigate target imbalance in these datasets, significantly improving the recall and balanced accuracy for underrepresented but clinically important patient populations. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different sampling strategies and instance bagsizes by ablation studies. Our results highlight the benefits of large-scale histopathological pretraining for more precise and transferable regressive biomarker prediction, showcasing its potential to advance AI-driven precision oncology.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures and 5 tables</p></details> |

While foundational time series models have proven beneficial on a variety of tasks, their effectiveness in medical applications with limited data remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate this question in the context of electroencephalography (EEG) by evaluating general-purpose time series models on age prediction, seizure detection, and classification of clinically relevant EEG events. We compare their diagnostic performance against specialised EEG models and assess the quality of the extracted features. The results show that general-purpose models are competitive and capture features useful to localising demographic and disease-related biomarkers. These findings indicate that foundational time series models can reduce the reliance on large task-specific datasets and models, making them valuable in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

Among SSL methods, Contrastive Learning (CL) methods are better at obtaining accurate semantic representations in noise interference. However, due to the significant domain gap, while CL methods have achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, they still require specific adaptation for Remote Sensing (RS) images. To this end, we present a novel self-supervised method called PerA, which produces all-purpose RS features through semantically Perfectly Aligned sample pairs. Specifically, PerA obtains features from sampled views by applying spatially disjoint masks to augmented images rather than random cropping. Our framework provides high-quality features by ensuring consistency between teacher and student and predicting learnable mask tokens. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method demonstrates higher memory efficiency and can be trained with larger batches due to its sparse inputs. Additionally, the proposed method demonstrates remarkable adaptability to uncurated RS data and reduce the impact of the potential semantic inconsistency. We also collect an unlabeled pre-training dataset, which contains about 5 million RS images. We conducted experiments on multiple downstream task datasets and achieved performance comparable to previous state-of-the-art methods with a limited model scale, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work will contribute to practical remote sensing interpretation works.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in Geo-spatial Information Science, published by Taylor & Francis</p></details> |

Traditional statistical and deep learning (DL) models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data effectively. While time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance in general time series forecasting tasks, such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. However, their effectiveness in day-ahead EPF, particularly in volatile markets, remains underexplored. This paper presents a spike regularization strategy and evaluates a wide range of TSFMs, including Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs), MOIRAI, MOMENT, and TimesFM, against traditional statistical and DL models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM (CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data with volatile trends in Singapore. Exogenous factors (e.g. weather and calendar variables) are also incorporated into models where applicable. Results demonstrate that TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings. The findings offer practical guidance for improving forecast accuracy and decision-making in volatile electricity markets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AI4TS Workshop @ AAAI'26 (Oral and Poster), see https://ai4ts.github.io/aaai2026</p></details> |

This paper empirically evaluates foundation models capable of modeling cross-channel correlations against a baseline LSTM with reversible instance normalization across Singaporean and Australian electricity markets at hourly and daily granularities. We systematically assess MOIRAI, MOMENT, TinyTimeMixers, ChronosX, and Chronos-2 under three feature configurations: all features, selected features, and target-only. Our findings reveal highly variable effectiveness: while Chronos-2 achieves the best performance among foundation models (in zero-shot settings), the simple baseline frequently outperforms all foundation models in Singapore's stable climate, particularly for short-term horizons. Model architecture proves critical, with synergistic architectural implementations (TTM's channel-mixing, Chronos-2's grouped attention) consistently leveraging exogenous features, while other approaches show inconsistent benefits. Geographic context emerges as equally important, with foundation models demonstrating advantages primarily in variable climates. These results challenge assumptions about universal foundation model superiority and highlight the need for domain-specific models, specifically in the energy domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 Figure and 3 Tables.

| **[Position: Universal Time Series Foundation Models Rest on a Category Error](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05287v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This position paper argues that the pursuit of "Universal Foundation Models for Time Series" rests on a fundamental category error, mistaking a structural Container for a semantic Modality. We contend that because time series hold incompatible generative processes (e.g., finance vs. fluid dynamics), monolithic models degenerate into expensive "Generic Filters" that fail to generalize under distributional drift. To address this, we introduce the "Autoregressive Blindness Bound," a theoretical limit proving that history-only models cannot predict intervention-driven regime shifts. We advocate replacing universality with a Causal Control Agent paradigm, where an agent leverages external context to orchestrate a hierarchy of specialized solvers, from frozen domain experts to lightweight Just-in-Time adaptors. We conclude by calling for a shift in benchmarks from "Zero-Shot Accuracy" to "Drift Adaptation Speed" to prioritize robust, control-theoretic systems.</p></details> | Position Paper |

This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantification and Classification of Carbon Nanotubes in Electron Micrographs using Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06673v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate characterization of carbon nanotube morphologies in electron microscopy images is vital for exposure assessment and toxicological studies, yet current workflows rely on slow, subjective manual segmentation. This work presents a unified framework leveraging vision foundation models to automate the quantification and classification of CNTs in electron microscopy images. First, we introduce an interactive quantification tool built on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that segments particles with near-perfect accuracy using minimal user input. Second, we propose a novel classification pipeline that utilizes these segmentation masks to spatially constrain a DINOv2 vision transformer, extracting features exclusively from particle regions while suppressing background noise. Evaluated on a dataset of 1,800 TEM images, this architecture achieves 95.5% accuracy in distinguishing between four different CNT morphologies, significantly outperforming the current baseline despite using a fraction of the training data. Crucially, this instance-level processing allows the framework to resolve mixed samples, correctly classifying distinct particle types co-existing within a single field of view. These results demonstrate that integrating zero-shot segmentation with self-supervised feature learning enables high-throughput, reproducible nanomaterial analysis, transforming a labor-intensive bottleneck into a scalable, data-driven process.</p></details> |  |

We present EchoJEPA, a foundation model trained on 18 million echocardiograms across 300K patients, representing the largest pretraining corpus for this modality to date. By leveraging a latent predictive objective, EchoJEPA learns robust anatomical representations that ignore speckle noise. We validate this using a novel multi-view probing framework with frozen backbones, where EchoJEPA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by approximately 20% in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) estimation and 17% in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) estimation. The model also exhibits remarkable sample efficiency, reaching 79% view classification accuracy with only 1% of labeled data versus 42% for the best baseline trained on 100%. Crucially, EchoJEPA demonstrates superior generalization, degrading by only 2% under physics-informed acoustic perturbations compared to 17% for competitors. Most remarkably, its zero-shot performance on pediatric patients surpasses fully fine-tuned baselines, establishing latent prediction as a superior paradigm for robust, generalizable medical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Billion-Scale Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04768v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-structured data underpins many critical applications. While foundation models have transformed language and vision via large-scale pretraining and lightweight adaptation, extending this paradigm to general, real-world graphs is challenging. In this work, we present Graph Billion- Foundation-Fusion (GraphBFF): the first end-to-end recipe for building billion-parameter Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for arbitrary heterogeneous, billion-scale graphs. Central to the recipe is the GraphBFF Transformer, a flexible and scalable architecture designed for practical billion-scale GFMs. Using the GraphBFF, we present the first neural scaling laws for general graphs and show that loss decreases predictably as either model capacity or training data scales, depending on which factor is the bottleneck. The GraphBFF framework provides concrete methodologies for data batching, pretraining, and fine-tuning for building GFMs at scale. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework with an evaluation of a 1.4 billion-parameter GraphBFF Transformer pretrained on one billion samples. Across ten diverse, real-world downstream tasks on graphs unseen during training, spanning node- and link-level classification and regression, GraphBFF achieves remarkable zero-shot and probing performance, including in few-shot settings, with large margins of up to 31 PRAUC points. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open opportunities for making GFMs a practical and principled foundation for graph learning at industrial scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImmuVis: Hyperconvolutional Foundation Model for Imaging Mass Cytometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04585v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ImmuVis, an efficient convolutional foundation model for imaging mass cytometry (IMC), a high-throughput multiplex imaging technology that handles molecular marker measurements as image channels and enables large-scale spatial tissue profiling. Unlike natural images, multiplex imaging lacks a fixed channel space, as real-world marker sets vary across studies, violating a core assumption of standard vision backbones. To address this, ImmuVis introduces marker-adaptive hyperconvolutions that generate convolutional kernels from learned marker embeddings, enabling a single model to operate on arbitrary measured marker subsets without retraining. We pretrain ImmuVis on the largest to-date dataset, IMC17M (28 cohorts, 24,405 images, 265 markers, over 17M patches), using self-supervised masked reconstruction. ImmuVis outperforms SOTA baselines and ablations in virtual staining and downstream classification tasks at substantially lower compute cost than transformer-based alternatives, and is the sole model that provides calibrated uncertainty via a heteroscedastic likelihood objective. These results position ImmuVis as a practical, efficient foundation model for real-world IMC modeling.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

In this work, we introduce OmniRad, a self-supervised radiological foundation model pretrained on 1.2 million medical images, designed with radiology-inspired principles emphasizing representation reuse and cross-task transferability. We evaluate the pretrained encoder under multiple downstream adaptation regimes, including lightweight task-specific adapters with a frozen backbone as well as full end-to-end fine-tuning for classification, allowing us to assess both representation quality and task-specific performance. OmniRad is evaluated on a broad suite of public benchmarks spanning classification and segmentation across multiple modalities. On the MedMNISTv2 collection, OmniRad improves classification F1 by up to 2.05% over competing foundation models. For dense prediction, OmniRad attains mean Dice score improvements across six MedSegBench datasets when using frozen representations. Qualitative analyses and latent-space visualizations suggest improved feature clustering and modality-related separation.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 4 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[StainNet: Scaling Self-Supervised Foundation Models on Immunohistochemistry and Special Stains for Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10326v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale histological images have significantly accelerated the development of computational pathology. These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H\&E) stained pathology images. However, images such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) and special stains are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving these non-H\&E images. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a collection of self-supervised foundation models specifically trained for IHC and special stains in pathology images based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet contains a ViT-Small and a ViT-Base model, both of which are trained using a self-distillation SSL approach on over 1.4 million patch images extracted from 20,231 publicly available IHC and special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database. To evaluate StainNet models, we conduct experiments on three in-house slide-level IHC classification tasks, three in-house ROI-level special stain and two public ROI-level IHC classification tasks to demonstrate their strong ability. We also perform ablation studies such as few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet models with recent larger PFMs to further highlight their strengths.

In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the availability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited. Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of unlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models, that can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich feature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training effort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we investigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The mitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an independent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor grading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on multiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen tumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We compare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision Transformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models provide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing, reaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of training data. Furthermore, LoRA-adaptation of the most recent foundation models almost closes the out-of-domain performance gap when evaluated on unseen tumor domains. However, full fine-tuning of traditional architectures still yields competitive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the Journal of Machine Learning for Biomedical Imaging (MELBA) https://melba-journal.org/2026:003</p></details> |

Given the complexity of physical constraints, two challenges stand out. $(i)$ Physics-computation scalability: physics-informed learning can enforce physical regularization, but its computation (e.g., ODE integration) does not scale to extensive systems. $(ii)$ Knowledge-sharing efficiency: the attention mechanism is primarily computed within each system, which limits the extraction of shared ODE structures across systems. We show that enforcing ODE consistency does not require expensive nonlinear integration: a token-wise locally linear ODE representation preserves physical fidelity while scaling to foundation-model regimes. Thus, we propose novel token representations that respect locally linear ODE evolution. Such linearity substantially accelerates integration while accurately approximating the local data manifold. Second, we introduce a simple yet effective inter-system attention that augments attention with a common structure hub (CSH) that stores shared tokens and aggregates knowledge across systems. The resulting model, termed LASS-ODE (\underline{LA}rge-\underline{S}cale \underline{S}mall \underline{ODE}), is pretrained on our $40$GB ODE trajectory collections to enable strong in-domain performance, zero-shot generalization across diverse ODE systems, and additional improvements through fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training A Foundation Model to Represent Graphs as Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04244v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper aims to train a graph foundation model that is able to represent any graph as a vector preserving structural and semantic information useful for downstream graph-level tasks such as graph classification and graph clustering. To learn the features of graphs from diverse domains while maintaining strong generalization ability to new domains, we propose a multi-graph-based feature alignment method, which constructs weighted graphs using the attributes of all nodes in each dataset and then generates consistent node embeddings. To enhance the consistency of the features from different datasets, we propose a density maximization mean alignment algorithm with guaranteed convergence. The original graphs and generated node embeddings are fed into a graph neural network to achieve discriminative graph representations in contrastive learning. More importantly, to enhance the information preservation from node-level representations to the graph-level representation, we construct a multi-layer reference distribution module without using any pooling operation. We also provide a theoretical generalization bound to support the effectiveness of the proposed model. The experimental results of few-shot graph classification and graph clustering show that our model outperforms strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Effective Multimodal Graph Foundation Model: A Divide-and-Conquer Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04116v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have achieved remarkable success in generalizing across diverse domains. However, they mainly focus on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), leaving Multimodal-Attributed Graphs (MAGs) largely untapped. Developing Multimodal Graph Foundation Models (MGFMs) allows for leveraging the rich multimodal information in MAGs, and extends applicability to broader types of downstream tasks. While recent MGFMs integrate diverse modality information, our empirical investigation reveals two fundamental limitations of existing MGFMs: (1)they fail to explicitly model modality interaction, essential for capturing intricate cross-modal semantics beyond simple aggregation, and (2)they exhibit sub-optimal modality alignment, which is critical for bridging the significant semantic disparity between distinct modal spaces. To address these challenges, we propose PLANET (graPh topoLogy-aware modAlity iNteraction and alignmEnT), a novel framework employing a Divide-and-Conquer strategy to decouple modality interaction and alignment across distinct granularities. At the embedding granularity, (1)Embedding-wise Domain Gating (EDG) performs local semantic enrichment by adaptively infusing topology-aware cross-modal context, achieving modality interaction. At the node granularity, (2)Node-wise Discretization Retrieval (NDR) ensures global modality alignment by constructing a Discretized Semantic Representation Space (DSRS) to bridge modality gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLANET significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse graph-centric and multimodal generative tasks.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |

These challenges require safety notions beyond physical constraint satisfaction. In this paper, we characterize FM-enabled robot safety along three dimensions: action safety (physical feasibility and constraint compliance), decision safety (semantic and contextual appropriateness), and human-centered safety (conformance to human intent, norms, and expectations). We argue that existing approaches, including static verification, monolithic controllers, and end-to-end learned policies, are insufficient in settings where tasks, environments, and human expectations are open-ended, long-tailed, and subject to adaptation over time. To address this gap, we propose modular safety guardrails, consisting of monitoring (evaluation) and intervention layers, as an architectural foundation for comprehensive safety across the autonomy stack. Beyond modularity, we highlight possible cross-layer co-design opportunities through representation alignment and conservatism allocation to enable faster, less conservative, and more effective safety enforcement. We call on the community to explore richer guardrail modules and principled co-design strategies to advance safe real-world physical AI deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, the diverse relational databases needed to train such models are rarely public due to privacy constraints. While there are methods to generate synthetic tabular data of arbitrary size, incorporating schema structure and primary--foreign key connectivity for multi-table generation remains challenging. Here we introduce PluRel, a framework to synthesize multi-tabular relational databases from scratch. In a step-by-step fashion, PluRel models (1) schemas with directed graphs, (2) inter-table primary-foreign key connectivity with bipartite graphs, and, (3) feature distributions in tables via conditional causal mechanisms. The design space across these stages supports the synthesis of a wide range of diverse databases, while being computationally lightweight. Using PluRel, we observe for the first time that (1) RFM pretraining loss exhibits power-law scaling with the number of synthetic databases and total pretraining tokens, (2) scaling the number of synthetic databases improves generalization to real databases, and (3) synthetic pretraining yields strong base models for continued pretraining on real databases. Overall, our framework and results position synthetic data scaling as a promising paradigm for RFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/snap-stanford/plurel</p></details> |

However, most existing omic FMs rely primarily on numerical transcriptomic data by sorting genes as sequences, while lacking explicit integration of biomedical prior knowledge and signaling interactions that are critical for scientific discovery. Here, we introduce the Text-Omic Signaling Graph (TOSG), a novel data structure that unifies human-interpretable biomedical textual knowledge, quantitative omic data, and signaling network information. Using this framework, we construct OmniCellTOSG, a large-scale resource comprising approximately half million meta-cell TOSGs derived from around 80 million single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq profiles across organs and diseases. We further develop CellTOSG-FM, a multimodal graph language FM, to jointly analyze textual, omic and signaling network context. Across diverse downstream tasks, CellTOSG-FM outperforms existing omic FMs, and provides interpretable insights into disease-associated targets and signaling pathways.</p></details> |  |

Yet, today's learning-based wireless techniques do not generalize well: most models are task-specific, environment-dependent, and limited to narrow sensing modalities, requiring costly retraining when deployed in new scenarios. This work introduces a task-agnostic, multi-modal foundational model for physical-layer wireless systems that learns transferable, physics-aware representations across heterogeneous modalities, enabling robust generalization across tasks and environments. Our framework employs a physics-guided self-supervised pretraining strategy incorporating a dedicated physical token to capture cross-modal physical correspondences governed by electromagnetic propagation. The learned representations enable efficient adaptation to diverse downstream tasks, including massive multi-antenna optimization, wireless channel estimation, and device localization, using limited labeled data. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate superior generalization, robustness to deployment shifts, and reduced data requirements compared to task-specific baselines.</p></details> |  |

As the DeFi ecosystem becomes increasingly linked with traditional financial infrastructure through instruments, such as stablecoins, the risk posed by this dynamic demands more powerful quantification tools. We introduce DeXposure-FM, the first time-series, graph foundation model for measuring and forecasting inter-protocol credit exposure on DeFi networks, to the best of our knowledge. Employing a graph-tabular encoder, with pre-trained weight initialization, and multiple task-specific heads, DeXposure-FM is trained on the DeXposure dataset that has 43.7 million data entries, across 4,300+ protocols on 602 blockchains, covering 24,300+ unique tokens. The training is operationalized for credit-exposure forecasting, predicting the joint dynamics of (1) protocol-level flows, and (2) the topology and weights of credit-exposure links. The DeXposure-FM is empirically validated on two machine learning benchmarks; it consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, including a graph foundation model and temporal graph neural networks. DeXposure-FM further produces financial economics tools that support macroprudential monitoring and scenario-based DeFi stress testing, by enabling protocol-level systemic-importance scores, sector-level spillover and concentration measures via a forecast-then-measure pipeline. Empirical verification fully supports our financial economics tools. The model and code have been publicly available. Model: https://huggingface.co/EVIEHub/DeXposure-FM.

However, raw VFM features are typically high-dimensional and redundant, increasing the difficulty of learning and reducing training efficiency for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). In this paper, we propose Repack then Refine, a three-stage framework that brings the semantic-rich VFM features to DiT while further accelerating learning efficiency. Specifically, the RePack module projects the high-dimensional features onto a compact, low-dimensional manifold. This filters out the redundancy while preserving essential structural information. A standard DiT is then trained for generative modeling on this highly compressed latent space. Finally, to restore the high-frequency details lost due to the compression in RePack, we propose a Latent-Guided Refiner, which is trained lastly for enhancing the image details. On ImageNet-1K, RePack-DiT-XL/1 achieves an FID of 1.82 in only 64 training epochs. With the Refiner module, performance further improves to an FID of 1.65, significantly surpassing latest LDMs in terms of convergence efficiency. Our results demonstrate that packing VFM features, followed by targeted refinement, is a highly effective strategy for balancing generative fidelity with training efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Users Understand Robot Foundation Model Performance through Task Success Rates and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03920v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot Foundation Models (RFMs) represent a promising approach to developing general-purpose home robots. Given the broad capabilities of RFMs, users will inevitably ask an RFM-based robot to perform tasks that the RFM was not trained or evaluated on. In these cases, it is crucial that users understand the risks associated with attempting novel tasks due to the relatively high cost of failure. Furthermore, an informed user who understands an RFM's capabilities will know what situations and tasks the robot can handle. In this paper, we study how non-roboticists interpret performance information from RFM evaluations. These evaluations typically report task success rate (TSR) as the primary performance metric. While TSR is intuitive to experts, it is necessary to validate whether novices also use this information as intended. Toward this end, we conducted a study in which users saw real evaluation data, including TSR, failure case descriptions, and videos from multiple published RFM research projects. The results highlight that non-experts not only use TSR in a manner consistent with expert expectations but also highly value other information types, such as failure cases that are not often reported in RFM evaluations. Furthermore, we find that users want access to both real data from previous evaluations of the RFM and estimates from the robot about how well it will do on a novel task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IJCAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Mapping the Unseen: Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping with Dynamic Labeling using Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02162v5)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoptic maps enable robots to reason about both geometry and semantics. However, open-vocabulary models repeatedly produce closely related labels that split panoptic entities and degrade volumetric consistency. The proposed UPPM advances open-world scene understanding by leveraging foundation models to introduce a panoptic Dynamic Descriptor that reconciles open-vocabulary labels with unified category structure and geometric size priors. The fusion for such dynamic descriptors is performed within a multi-resolution multi-TSDF map using language-guided open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation and semantic retrieval, resulting in a persistent and promptable panoptic map without additional model training. Based on our evaluation experiments, UPPM shows the best overall performance in terms of the map reconstruction accuracy and the panoptic segmentation quality. The ablation study investigates the contribution for each component of UPPM (custom NMS, blurry-frame filtering, and unified semantics) to the overall system performance. Consequently, UPPM preserves open-vocabulary interpretability while delivering strong geometric and panoptic accuracy.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we present LegalOne, a family of foundational models specifically tailored for the Chinese legal domain. LegalOne is developed through a comprehensive three-phase pipeline designed to master legal reasoning. First, during mid-training phase, we propose Plasticity-Adjusted Sampling (PAS) to address the challenge of domain adaptation. This perplexity-based scheduler strikes a balance between the acquisition of new knowledge and the retention of original capabilities, effectively establishing a robust legal foundation. Second, during supervised fine-tuning, we employ Legal Agentic CoT Distillation (LEAD) to distill explicit reasoning from raw legal texts. Unlike naive distillation, LEAD utilizes an agentic workflow to convert complex judicial processes into structured reasoning trajectories, thereby enforcing factual grounding and logical rigor. Finally, we implement a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategy. Through a progressive reinforcement process spanning memorization, understanding, and reasoning, LegalOne evolves from simple pattern matching to autonomous and reliable legal reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that LegalOne achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of legal tasks, surpassing general-purpose LLMs with vastly larger parameter counts through enhanced knowledge density and efficiency. We publicly release the LegalOne weights and the LegalKit evaluation framework to advance the field of Legal AI, paving the way for deploying trustworthy and interpretable foundation models in high-stakes judicial applications.</p></details> | 25 pages, v1 |

Existing works mainly work towards two directions: traditional pixel-codec streaming nearly approaches its limit and is hard to step further in compression; the emerging neural-enhanced or generative streaming usually fall short in latency and visual fidelity, hindering their practical deployment. Inspired by the recent success of vision foundation model (VFM), we strive to harness the powerful video understanding and processing capacities of VFM to achieve generalization, high fidelity and loss resilience for real-time video streaming with even higher compression rate. We present the first revolutionized paradigm that enables VFM-based end-to-end generative video streaming towards this goal. Specifically, Morphe employs joint training of visual tokenizers and variable-resolution spatiotemporal optimization under simulated network constraints. Additionally, a robust streaming system is constructed that leverages intelligent packet dropping to resist real-world network perturbations. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that Morphe achieves comparable visual quality while saving 62.5\% bandwidth compared to H.265, and accomplishes real-time, loss-resilient video delivery in challenging network environments, representing a milestone in VFM-enabled multimedia streaming solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NSDI 2026 Fall</p></details> |

We present Full-process OCT-based Clinical Utility System (FOCUS), a foundation model-driven framework enabling end-to-end automation of 3D OCT retinal disease diagnosis. FOCUS sequentially performs image quality assessment with EfficientNetV2-S, followed by abnormality detection and multi-disease classification using a fine-tuned Vision Foundation Model. Crucially, FOCUS leverages a unified adaptive aggregation method to intelligently integrate 2D slices-level predictions into comprehensive 3D patient-level diagnosis. Trained and tested on 3,300 patients (40,672 slices), and externally validated on 1,345 patients (18,498 slices) across four different-tier centers and diverse OCT devices, FOCUS achieved high F1 scores for quality assessment (99.01%), abnormally detection (97.46%), and patient-level diagnosis (94.39%). Real-world validation across centers also showed stable performance (F1: 90.22%-95.24%). In human-machine comparisons, FOCUS matched expert performance in abnormality detection (F1: 95.47% vs 90.91%) and multi-disease diagnosis (F1: 93.49% vs 91.35%), while demonstrating better efficiency. FOCUS automates the image-to-diagnosis pipeline, representing a critical advance towards unmanned ophthalmology with a validated blueprint for autonomous screening to enhance population scale retinal care accessibility and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[FSOD-VFM: Few-Shot Object Detection with Vision Foundation Models and Graph Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03137v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present FSOD-VFM: Few-Shot Object Detectors with Vision Foundation Models, a framework that leverages vision foundation models to tackle the challenge of few-shot object detection. FSOD-VFM integrates three key components: a universal proposal network (UPN) for category-agnostic bounding box generation, SAM2 for accurate mask extraction, and DINOv2 features for efficient adaptation to new object categories. Despite the strong generalization capabilities of foundation models, the bounding boxes generated by UPN often suffer from overfragmentation, covering only partial object regions and leading to numerous small, false-positive proposals rather than accurate, complete object detections. To address this issue, we introduce a novel graph-based confidence reweighting method. In our approach, predicted bounding boxes are modeled as nodes in a directed graph, with graph diffusion operations applied to propagate confidence scores across the network. This reweighting process refines the scores of proposals, assigning higher confidence to whole objects and lower confidence to local, fragmented parts. This strategy improves detection granularity and effectively reduces the occurrence of false-positive bounding box proposals. Through extensive experiments on Pascal-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$, and CD-FSOD datasets, we demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance without requiring additional training. Notably, on the challenging CD-FSOD dataset, which spans multiple datasets and domains, our FSOD-VFM achieves 31.6 AP in the 10-shot setting, substantially outperforming previous training-free methods that reach only 21.4 AP.

| **[A generalizable large-scale foundation model for musculoskeletal radiographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03076v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise in detecting and characterizing musculoskeletal diseases from radiographs. However, most existing models remain task-specific, annotation-dependent, and limited in generalizability across diseases and anatomical regions. Although a generalizable foundation model trained on large-scale musculoskeletal radiographs is clinically needed, publicly available datasets remain limited in size and lack sufficient diversity to enable training across a wide range of musculoskeletal conditions and anatomical sites. Here, we present SKELEX, a large-scale foundation model for musculoskeletal radiographs, trained using self-supervised learning on 1.2 million diverse, condition-rich images. The model was evaluated on 12 downstream diagnostic tasks and generally outperformed baselines in fracture detection, osteoarthritis grading, and bone tumor classification. Furthermore, SKELEX demonstrated zero-shot abnormality localization, producing error maps that identified pathologic regions without task-specific training. Building on this capability, we developed an interpretable, region-guided model for predicting bone tumors, which maintained robust performance on independent external datasets and was deployed as a publicly accessible web application. Overall, SKELEX provides a scalable, label-efficient, and generalizable AI framework for musculoskeletal imaging, establishing a foundation for both clinical translation and data-efficient research in musculoskeletal radiology.</p></details> |  |

Although foundation models have revolutionized language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains constrained by data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. We present Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision to build robust representations for broad applications. To enable efficient use, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across disease classification, demographic prediction, anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent improvements over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches. These results position Decipher-MR as a versatile foundation for MRI-based AI in clinical and research settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[To What Extent Do Token-Level Representations from Pathology Foundation Models Improve Dense Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03887v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have rapidly advanced and are becoming a common backbone for downstream clinical tasks, offering strong transferability across tissues and institutions. However, for dense prediction (e.g., segmentation), practical deployment still lacks a clear, reproducible understanding of how different PFMs behave across datasets and how adaptation choices affect performance and stability. We present PFM-DenseBench, a large-scale benchmark for dense pathology prediction, evaluating 17 PFMs across 18 public segmentation datasets. Under a unified protocol, we systematically assess PFMs with multiple adaptation and fine-tuning strategies, and derive insightful, practice-oriented findings on when and why different PFMs and tuning choices succeed or fail across heterogeneous datasets. We release containers, configs, and dataset cards to enable reproducible evaluation and informed PFM selection for real-world dense pathology tasks.

Foundation models (FMs) have transformed ML, and OD is no exception: Shen et. al. (2025) introduced FoMo-0D, the first FM for OD, achieving remarkable performance against numerous baselines. This work introduces OUTFORMER, which advances FoMo-0D with (1) a mixture of synthetic priors and (2) self-evolving curriculum training. OUTFORMER is pretrained solely on synthetic labeled datasets and infers test labels of a new task by using its training data as in-context input. Inference is fast and zero-shot, requiring merely forward pass and no labeled outliers. Thanks to in-context learning, it requires zero additional work-no OD model training or bespoke model selection-enabling truly plug-and-play deployment. OUTFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on the prominent AdBench, as well as two new large-scale OD benchmarks that we introduce, comprising over 1,500 datasets, while maintaining speedy inference.</p></details> | 37 pages |

Motivated by recent advancements in 3D foundation models, which can register images despite large viewpoint differences, we propose a robust loop closing approach that leverages these models to establish inter-robot measurements. In contrast to resource-intensive methods requiring full 3D reconstruction within a centralized map, our approach integrates foundation models into existing SLAM pipelines, yielding scalable and robust multi-robot mapping. Our contributions include: (1) integrating 3D foundation models to reliably estimate relative poses from monocular image pairs within decentralized C-SLAM; (2) introducing robust outlier mitigation techniques critical to the use of these relative poses; and (3) developing specialized pose graph optimization formulations that efficiently resolve scale ambiguities. We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating improvements in localization and mapping accuracy, alongside significant gains in computational and memory efficiency. These results highlight the potential of our approach for deployment in large-scale multi-robot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[StefaLand: An Efficient Geoscience Foundation Model That Improves Dynamic Land-Surface Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17942v3)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Managing natural resources and mitigating risks from floods, droughts, wildfires, and landslides require models that can accurately predict climate-driven land-surface responses. Traditional models often struggle with spatial generalization because they are trained or calibrated on limited observations and can degrade under concept drift. Recently proposed vision foundation models trained on satellite imagery demand massive compute, and they are not designed for dynamic land surface prediction tasks. We introduce StefaLand, a generative spatiotemporal Earth representation learning model centered on learning cross-domain interactions to suppress overfitting. StefaLand demonstrates especially strong spatial generalization on five datasets across four important tasks: streamflow, soil moisture, soil composition and landslides, compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. The domain-inspired design choices include a location-aware masked autoencoder that fuses static and time-series inputs, an attribute-based rather than image-based representation that drastically reduces compute demands, and residual fine-tuning adapters that strengthen knowledge transfer across tasks. StefaLand can be pretrained and finetuned on commonly available academic compute resources, yet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised learning baselines, fine-tuned vision foundation models and commercially available embeddings, highlighting the previously overlooked value of cross-domain interactions and providing assistance to data-poor regions of the world.</p></details> |  |

We introduce KernelICL, a framework to enhance tabular foundation models with quantifiable sample-based interpretability. Building on the insight that in-context learning is akin to kernel regression, we make this mechanism explicit by replacing the final prediction layer with kernel functions (Gaussian, dot-product, kNN) so that every prediction is a transparent weighted average of training labels. We introduce a two-dimensional taxonomy that formally unifies standard kernel methods, modern neighbor-based approaches, and attention mechanisms under a single framework, and quantify inspectability via the perplexity of the weight distribution over training samples. On 55 TALENT benchmark datasets, KernelICL achieves performance on par with existing tabular foundation models, demonstrating that explicit kernel constraints on the final layer enable inspectable predictions without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Contrastive Decoding for Robotic Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13255v5)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic foundation models, or generalist robot policies, hold immense potential to enable flexible, general-purpose and dexterous robotic systems. Despite their advancements, our empirical experiments reveal that existing robot policies are prone to learning spurious correlations from pre-training trajectories, adversely affecting their generalization capabilities beyond the training data. To tackle this, we propose a novel Policy Contrastive Decoding (PCD) approach, which redirects the robot policy's focus toward object-relevant visual clues by contrasting action probability distributions derived from original and object-masked visual inputs. As a training-free method, our PCD can be used as a plugin to improve different types of robot policies without needing to finetune or access model weights. We conduct extensive experiments on top of three open-source robot policies, including the autoregressive policy OpenVLA and the diffusion-based policies Octo and $π_0$. The obtained results in both simulation and real-world environments prove PCD's flexibility and effectiveness, e.g., PCD enhances the state-of-the-art policy $π_0$ by 8.9% in the simulation environment and by 108% in the real-world environment. Code and demos are publicly available at: https://koorye.github.io/PCD.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches, however, face critical limitations. Supervised models require impractical amounts of labeled data. Foundation models for activity recognition focus only on inertial sensors, failing to address the unique characteristics of smart-home binary sensor events: their sparse, discrete nature combined with rich semantic associations. LLM-based approaches, while tested in this domain, still raise several issues regarding the need for natural language descriptions or prompting, and reliance on either external services or expensive hardware, making them infeasible in real-life scenarios due to privacy and cost concerns. We introduce DomusFM, the first foundation model specifically designed and pretrained for smart-home sensor data. DomusFM employs a self-supervised dual contrastive learning paradigm to capture both token-level semantic attributes and sequence-level temporal dependencies. By integrating semantic embeddings from a lightweight language model and specialized encoders for temporal patterns and binary states, DomusFM learns generalizable representations that transfer across environments and tasks related to activity and event analysis. Through leave-one-dataset-out evaluation across seven public smart-home datasets, we demonstrate that DomusFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on different downstream tasks, achieving superior performance even with only 5% of labeled training data available for fine-tuning. Our approach addresses data scarcity while maintaining practical deployability for real-world smart-home systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feat2GS: Probing Visual Foundation Models with Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09606v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given that visual foundation models (VFMs) are trained on extensive datasets but often limited to 2D images, a natural question arises: how well do they understand the 3D world? With the differences in architecture and training protocols (i.e., objectives, proxy tasks), a unified framework to fairly and comprehensively probe their 3D awareness is urgently needed. Existing works on 3D probing suggest single-view 2.5D estimation (e.g., depth and normal) or two-view sparse 2D correspondence (e.g., matching and tracking). Unfortunately, these tasks ignore texture awareness, and require 3D data as ground-truth, which limits the scale and diversity of their evaluation set. To address these issues, we introduce Feat2GS, which readout 3D Gaussians attributes from VFM features extracted from unposed images. This allows us to probe 3D awareness for geometry and texture via novel view synthesis, without requiring 3D data. Additionally, the disentanglement of 3DGS parameters - geometry ($\boldsymbol{x}$, $α$, $Σ$) and texture ($\boldsymbol{c}$) - enables separate analysis of texture and geometry awareness. Under Feat2GS, we conduct extensive experiments to probe the 3D awareness of several VFMs, and investigate the ingredients that lead to a 3D aware VFM. Building on these findings, we develop several variants that achieve state-of-the-art across diverse datasets. This makes Feat2GS useful for probing VFMs, and as a simple-yet-effective baseline for novel-view synthesis.

| **[SPIRIT: Adapting Vision Foundation Models for Unified Single- and Multi-Frame Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01843v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is crucial for surveillance and early-warning, with deployments spanning both single-frame analysis and video-mode tracking. A practical solution should leverage vision foundation models (VFMs) to mitigate infrared data scarcity, while adopting a memory-attention-based temporal propagation framework that unifies single- and multi-frame inference. However, infrared small targets exhibit weak radiometric signals and limited semantic cues, which differ markedly from visible-spectrum imagery. This modality gap makes direct use of semantics-oriented VFMs and appearance-driven cross-frame association unreliable for IRSTD: hierarchical feature aggregation can submerge localized target peaks, and appearance-only memory attention becomes ambiguous, leading to spurious clutter associations. To address these challenges, we propose SPIRIT, a unified and VFM-compatible framework that adapts VFMs to IRSTD via lightweight physics-informed plug-ins. Spatially, PIFR refines features by approximating rank-sparsity decomposition to suppress structured background components and enhance sparse target-like signals. Temporally, PGMA injects history-derived soft spatial priors into memory cross-attention to constrain cross-frame association, enabling robust video detection while naturally reverting to single-frame inference when temporal context is absent. Experiments on multiple IRSTD benchmarks show consistent gains over VFM-based baselines and SOTA performance.</p></details> |  |

Current studies on LLMs have shown immense potential in applying LLMs to model individual mobility prediction problems. However, most LLM-based mobility prediction models only train on specific datasets or use single well-designed prompts, leading to difficulty in adapting to different cities and users with diverse contexts. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes a unified fine-tuning framework to train a foundational open source LLM-based mobility prediction model. We conducted extensive experiments on six real-world mobility datasets to validate the proposed model. The results showed that the proposed model achieved the best performance in prediction accuracy and transferability over state-of-the-art models based on deep learning and LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we demonstrate that simplicity prevails over complex architectural designs. A simple linear classifier trained on the frozen features of modern Vision Foundation Models , including Perception Encoder, MetaCLIP 2, and DINOv3, establishes a new state-of-the-art. Through a comprehensive evaluation spanning traditional benchmarks, unseen generators, and challenging in-the-wild distributions, we show that this baseline not only matches specialized detectors on standard benchmarks but also decisively outperforms them on in-the-wild datasets, boosting accuracy by striking margins of over 30\%. We posit that this superior capability is an emergent property driven by the massive scale of pre-training data containing synthetic content. We trace the source of this capability to two distinct manifestations of data exposure: Vision-Language Models internalize an explicit semantic concept of forgery, while Self-Supervised Learning models implicitly acquire discriminative forensic features from the pretraining data. However, we also reveal persistent limitations: these models suffer from performance degradation under recapture and transmission, remain blind to VAE reconstruction and localized editing. We conclude by advocating for a paradigm shift in AI forensics, moving from overfitting on static benchmarks to harnessing the evolving world knowledge of foundation models for real-world reliability.</p></details> |  |

However, this distributed setup raises serious privacy concerns due to the need for cross-partition data sharing. Split learning addresses these concerns by enabling collaborative model training without raw data exchange between partitions, yet it introduces a significant challenge: transmitting high-dimensional intermediate feature representations between partitions leads to substantial communication costs. To address this challenge, we propose Quantized-TinyLLaVA, a multimodal foundation model with an integrated communication-efficient split learning framework. Our approach adopts a compression module that quantizes intermediate feature into discrete representations before transmission, substantially reducing communication overhead. Besides, we derive a principled quantization strategy grounded in entropy coding theory to determine the optimal number of discrete representation levels. We deploy our framework in a two-partition setting, with one partition operating as the client and the other as the server, to realistically simulate distributed training. Under this setup, Quantized-TinyLLaVA achieves an approximate \textbf{87.5\%} reduction in communication overhead with 2-bit quantization, while maintaining performance of the original 16-bit model across five benchmark datasets. Furthermore, our compressed representations exhibit enhanced resilience against feature inversion attacks, validating the privacy of transmission. The code is available at https://github.com/anonymous-1742/Quantized-TinyLLaVA.</p></details> |  |

Through large-scale evaluations on standard benchmarks, we find that leading transformer-based TSFMs exhibit redundant components in their intermediate layers. We introduce a set of tools for mechanistic interpretability of TSFMs, including ablations of specific components and direct logit attribution on the residual stream. Our findings are consistent across several leading TSFMs with diverse architectures, and across a diverse set of real-world and synthetic time-series datasets. We discover that all models in our study are robust to ablations of entire layers. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical framework framing transformers as kernel regressors, motivating a purely intrinsic strategy for ablating heads based on the stable rank of the per-head projection matrices. Using this approach, we uncover the specific heads responsible for degenerate phenomena widely observed in TSFMs, such as parroting of motifs from the context and seasonality bias. Our study sheds light on the universal properties of this emerging class of architectures for continuous-time sequence modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Longitudinal Progression Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease with Tabular Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17649v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that remains challenging to predict due to its multifactorial etiology and the complexity of multimodal clinical data. Accurate forecasting of clinically relevant biomarkers, including diagnostic and quantitative measures, is essential for effective monitoring of disease progression. This work introduces L2C-TabPFN, a method that integrates a longitudinal-to-cross-sectional (L2C) transformation with a pre-trained Tabular Foundation Model (TabPFN) to predict Alzheimer's disease outcomes using the TADPOLE dataset. L2C-TabPFN converts sequential patient records into fixed-length feature vectors, enabling robust prediction of diagnosis, cognitive scores, and ventricular volume. Experimental results demonstrate that, while L2C-TabPFN achieves competitive performance on diagnostic and cognitive outcomes, it provides state-of-the-art results in ventricular volume prediction. This key imaging biomarker reflects neurodegeneration and progression in Alzheimer's disease. These findings highlight the potential of tabular foundational models for advancing longitudinal prediction of clinically relevant imaging markers in Alzheimer's disease.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[A texture-based framework for foundational ultrasound models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01444v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultrasound is the most widely used medical imaging modality, yet the images it produces are fundamentally unique, arising from tissue-dependent scattering, reflection, and speed-of-sound variations that produce a constrained set of characteristic textures that differ markedly from natural-image statistics. These acoustically driven patterns make ultrasound challenging for algorithms originally designed for natural images. To bridge this gap, the field has increasingly turned to foundation models, hoping to leverage their generalization capabilities. However, these models often falter in ultrasound applications because they are not designed for ultrasound physics, they are merely trained on ultrasound data. Therefore, it is essential to integrate ultrasound-specific domain knowledge into established learning frameworks. We achieve this by reformulating self-supervised learning as a texture-analysis problem, introducing texture ultrasound semantic analysis (TUSA). Using TUSA, models learn to leverage highly scalable contrastive methods to extract true domain-specific representations directly from simple B-mode images. We train a TUSA model on a combination of open-source, simulated, and in vivo data. The latent space is compared to several larger foundation models, demonstrating that our approach gives TUSA models better generalizability for difficult downstream tasks on unique online datasets as well as a clinical eye dataset collected for this study. Our model achieves higher accuracy in detecting COVID (70%), spinal hematoma (100%) and vitreous hemorrhage (97%) and correlates more closely with quantitative parameters like liver steatosis (r = 0.83), ejection fraction (r = 0.63), and oxygen saturation (r = 0.38).

As training data collections grow, manually managing the samples becomes time-consuming, tedious, and prone to errors. Yet recent research shows that the data mixture and the order in which samples are visited during training can significantly influence model accuracy. We build and present Mixtera, a data plane for foundation model training that enables users to declaratively express which data samples should be used in which proportion and in which order during training. Mixtera is a centralized, read-only layer that is deployed on top of existing training data collections and can be declaratively queried. It operates independently of the filesystem structure and supports mixtures across arbitrary properties (e.g., language, source dataset) as well as dynamic adjustment of the mixture based on model feedback. We experimentally evaluate Mixtera and show that our implementation does not bottleneck training and scales to 256 GH200 superchips. We demonstrate how Mixtera supports recent advancements in mixing strategies by implementing the proposed Adaptive Data Optimization (ADO) algorithm in the system and evaluating its performance impact. We also explore the role of mixtures for vision-language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at SIGMOD'26; two column layout version</p></details> |

Existing works either involve rebuilding Gaussian process surrogates from scratch for each objective in each new problem encountered, or rely on extensive past domain experiments for pre-training deep learning models, making them hard to generalize and impractical to cope with various emerging applications in the real world. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm named FoMEMO (Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization), which enables the establishment of a foundation model conditioned on any domain trajectory and user preference, and facilitates fast in-context optimization based on the predicted preference-wise aggregated posteriors. Rather than accessing extensive real-world domain experiments for training, we demonstrate that pre-training the foundation model with a diverse set of hundreds of millions of synthetic data can lead to superior generalization and optimization performance to unknown problems, without necessitating any subsequent model training or updates in the following optimization process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward a Vision-Language Foundation Model for Medical Data: Multimodal Dataset and Benchmarks for Vietnamese PET/CT Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24739v3)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) by enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains, applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset consisting of 2,757 whole-body PET/CT volumes from independent patients and their corresponding full-length clinical reports. This dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1) the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks; and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs' learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on downstream tasks. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, especially for low-resource languages and clinical use in Vietnamese healthcare.

| **[Baseline Method of the Foundation Model Challenge for Ultrasound Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01055v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultrasound (US) imaging exhibits substantial heterogeneity across anatomical structures and acquisition protocols, posing significant challenges to the development of generalizable analysis models. Most existing methods are task-specific, limiting their suitability as clinically deployable foundation models. To address this limitation, the Foundation Model Challenge for Ultrasound Image Analysis (FM\_UIA~2026) introduces a large-scale multi-task benchmark comprising 27 subtasks across segmentation, classification, detection, and regression. In this paper, we present the official baseline for FM\_UIA~2026 based on a unified Multi-Head Multi-Task Learning (MH-MTL) framework that supports all tasks within a single shared network. The model employs an ImageNet-pretrained EfficientNet--B4 backbone for robust feature extraction, combined with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to capture multi-scale contextual information. A task-specific routing strategy enables global tasks to leverage high-level semantic features, while dense prediction tasks exploit spatially detailed FPN representations. Training incorporates a composite loss with task-adaptive learning rate scaling and a cosine annealing schedule. Validation results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of this unified design, establishing a strong and extensible baseline for ultrasound foundation model research. The code and dataset are publicly available at \href{https://github.com/lijiake2408/Foundation-Model-Challenge-for-Ultrasound-Image-Analysis}{GitHub}.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEAD: An EEG Foundation Model for Alzheimer's Disease Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01678v4)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive, highly accessible, and cost-effective approach for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, existing methods, whether based on handcrafted feature engineering or standard deep learning, face three major challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale EEG-based AD datasets for robust representation learning; 2) limited generalizability across subjects; and 3) difficulty in adapting to highly heterogeneous data. To address these challenges, we curate the world's largest EEG-AD corpus to date, comprising 2,238 subjects. Leveraging this unique resource, we propose LEAD, the first large-scale foundation model for EEG-based AD detection. Specifically, we design a gated temporal-spatial Transformer that can adapt to EEG recordings with arbitrary lengths, channel configurations, and sampling rates. In addition, we introduce a subject-regularized training strategy to enhance subject-level feature learning. We further employ medical contrastive learning for pre-training on 13 datasets, including 4 AD datasets and 9 non-AD neurological disorder datasets, and fine-tune/test the model on the other 5 AD datasets. LEAD achieves the best average ranking across all 20 evaluations on 5 downstream datasets, substantially outperforming existing approaches, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) EEG foundation models. These results strongly demonstrate the effectiveness and practical potential of the proposed method for real-world EEG-based AD detection.

However, existing architectures often fail to capture the multi-scale temporal structures and distinct spectral characteristics of chaotic dynamics. To address this, we introduce ChaosNexus, a foundation model for chaotic system forecasting underpinned by the proposed ScaleFormer architecture. By processing temporal contexts across hierarchically varying patch sizes, ChaosNexus effectively captures long-range dependencies and preserves high-frequency fluctuations. To address heterogeneity across distinct systems, we integrate Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers into each ScaleFormer block and explicitly condition the final forecasts on a learned frequency fingerprint, providing the model with a global spectral view of the system. Extensive evaluations on over 9,000 synthetic systems demonstrate that ChaosNexus achieves superior fidelity in long-term attractor statistics while maintaining competitive point-wise accuracy. Furthermore, in real-world applications, it achieves a remarkable zero-shot mean error below 1°C for 5-day station-based weather forecasting.

| **[Foundation CAN LM: A Pretrained Language Model For Automotive CAN Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00866v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus provides a rich source of vehicular signals increasingly leveraged for applications in automotive and auto insurance domains, including collision detection, predictive maintenance, and driver risk modeling. Despite this potential, existing pipelines largely train isolated task-specific models on raw CAN data, with only limited efforts exploring decoded signals. Such fragmentation prevents shared representation learning and limits cross-task generalization. By contrast, natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) have been transformed by the foundation model paradigm: large-scale pretraining followed by task-specific adaptation. In this work, we introduce the foundation CAN model that demonstrates multi-objective downstream generalization using a single pretrained backbone. Our approach treats CAN data as a language: we pretrain on large-scale, unlabeled decoded CAN signals and fine-tune across heterogeneous auto insurance tasks. To enable this, we propose a unified tokenization scheme for mixed discrete-continuous signals and address challenges of temporal complexity and trip-specific variability. Our results show that one pretrained CAN model can adapt effectively to diverse predictive tasks, validating that the foundation modeling paradigm, proven in NLP and CV, also holds for CAN data. This establishes a new direction for generalizable representation learning in automotive AI.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this compute divide, we introduce Distill3R, a framework designed to distill the geometric reasoning of 3D foundation models into compact students fully trainable on a single workstation. Our methodology centers on two primary innovations: (1) an offline caching pipeline that decouples heavy teacher inference from the training loop through compressed supervision signals, and (2) a confidence-aware distillation loss that leverages teacher uncertainty to enable training on commodity hardware. We propose a 72M-parameter student model which achieves a 9x reduction in parameters and a 5x inference speedup compared to its 650M-parameter teacher. The student is fully trainable in under 3 days on a single workstation, whereas its teacher requires massive GPU clusters for up to a week. We demonstrate that the student preserves the structural consistency and qualitative geometric understanding required for functional 3D awareness. By providing a reproducible, single-workstation training recipe, Distill3R serves as an exploratory entry point for democratized 3D vision research and efficient edge deployment. This work is not intended to compete with state-of-the-art foundation models, but to provide an accessible research baseline for laboratories without access to large-scale compute to train and specialize models on their own domain-specific data at minimal cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Canadian Conference on Robotics and Vision (CRV). 10 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

We show that faithful spectral analysis of the true Hessian is tractable at frontier scale. Using shard-local finite-difference Hessian vector products compatible with Fully Sharded Data Parallelism, we perform stochastic Lanczos quadrature on open-source language models with up to 100B parameters, producing the first large-scale spectral density estimates beyond the sub-10B regime. We characterize the numerical behavior of this pipeline, including finite-difference bias, floating-point noise amplification, and their effect on Krylov stability in fp32 and bf16, and derive practical operating regimes that are validated empirically. We further provide end-to-end runtime and memory scaling laws, showing that full-operator spectral probing incurs only a modest constant-factor overhead over first-order training. Crucially, direct access to the Hessian reveals that widely used block-diagonal curvature approximations can fail catastrophically, exhibiting order-one relative error and poor directional alignment even in mid-scale LLMs. Together, our results demonstrate that foundation-model Hessian spectra are both computable and qualitatively misrepresented by prevailing approximations, opening the door to principled curvature-based analysis at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Loss to Rule Them All: Marked Time-to-Event for Structured EHR Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00541v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical events captured in Electronic Health Records (EHR) are irregularly sampled and may consist of a mixture of discrete events and numerical measurements, such as laboratory values or treatment dosages. The sequential nature of EHR, analogous to natural language, has motivated the use of next-token prediction to train prior EHR Foundation Models (FMs) over events. However, this training fails to capture the full structure of EHR. We propose ORA, a marked time-to-event pretraining objective that jointly models event timing and associated measurements. Across multiple datasets, downstream tasks, and model architectures, this objective consistently yields more generalizable representations than next-token prediction and pretraining losses that ignore continuous measurements. Importantly, the proposed objective yields improvements beyond traditional classification evaluation, including better regression and time-to-event prediction. Beyond introducing a new family of FMs, our results suggest a broader takeaway: pretraining objectives that account for EHR structure are critical for expanding downstream capabilities and generalizability</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Large Language Models (Really) Need Statistical Foundations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19145v3)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) represent a new paradigm for processing unstructured data, with applications across an unprecedented range of domains. In this paper, we address, through two arguments, whether the development and application of LLMs would genuinely benefit from foundational contributions from the statistics discipline. First, we argue affirmatively, beginning with the observation that LLMs are inherently statistical models due to their profound data dependency and stochastic generation processes, where statistical insights are naturally essential for handling variability and uncertainty. Second, we argue that the persistent black-box nature of LLMs -- stemming from their immense scale, architectural complexity, and development practices often prioritizing empirical performance over theoretical interpretability -- renders closed-form or purely mechanistic analyses generally intractable, thereby necessitating statistical approaches due to their flexibility and often demonstrated effectiveness. To substantiate these arguments, the paper outlines several research areas -- including alignment, watermarking, uncertainty quantification, evaluation, and data mixture optimization -- where statistical methodologies are critically needed and are already beginning to make valuable contributions. We conclude with a discussion suggesting that statistical research concerning LLMs will likely form a diverse ``mosaic'' of specialized topics rather than deriving from a single unifying theory, and highlighting the importance of timely engagement by our statistics community in LLM research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The Annals of Applied Statistics; Added discussions on more topics</p></details> |

Recent large language models have opened new avenues for genomic analysis, but existing approaches are often limited by restricted training scope, constrained generative capability, or prohibitive computational cost. We introduce GENErator, a generative genomic foundation model for long-context DNA modeling, with a context length of 98k nucleotides, pre-trained on 386 billion nucleotides of eukaryotic DNA. Without task-specific fine-tuning, GENERator exhibits strong intrinsic capabilities: unsupervised embedding analyses reveal phylogenetically coherent structure, and sequence recovery benchmarks demonstrate generative accuracy comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art models with substantially improved computational efficiency. In a zero-shot setting, GENERator achieves competitive variant effect prediction performance relative to alignment-based methods, while remaining fully alignment-free and broadly applicable across species. With task-specific fine-tuning, the model attains leading performance on established genomic benchmarks. We further demonstrate practical generative applications. GENERator can generate protein-coding DNA sequences that translate into structurally plausible proteins and, through a prompt-guided design framework, design cis-regulatory elements with targeted activity profiles, including synthetic super-enhancers validated by high-throughput UMI-STARR-seq assays. Together, these results establish GENERator as an efficient and biologically grounded framework for genomic interpretation and programmable sequence design.

| **[Towards Building Non-Fine-Tunable Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00446v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-sourcing foundation models (FMs) enables broad reuse but also exposes model trainers to economic and safety risks from unrestricted downstream fine-tuning. We address this problem by building non-fine-tunable foundation models: models that remain broadly usable in their released form while yielding limited adaptation gains under task-agnostic unauthorized fine-tuning. We propose Private Mask Pre-Training (PMP), a pre-training framework that concentrates representation learning into a sparse subnetwork identified early in training. The binary mask defining this subnetwork is kept private, and only the final dense weights are released. This forces unauthorized fine-tuning without access to the mask to update parameters misaligned with pretraining subspace, inducing an intrinsic mismatch between the fine-tuning objective and the pre-training geometry. We provide theoretical analysis showing that this mismatch destabilizes gradient-based adaptation and bounds fine-tuning gains. Empirical results on large language models demonstrating that PMP preserves base model performance while consistently degrading unauthorized fine-tuning across a wide range of downstream tasks, with the strength of non-fine-tunability controlled by the mask ratio.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraceRouter: Robust Safety for Large Foundation Models via Path-Level Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21900v2)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their capabilities, large foundation models (LFMs) remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Current defenses predominantly rely on the "locality hypothesis", suppressing isolated neurons or features. However, harmful semantics act as distributed, cross-layer circuits, rendering such localized interventions brittle and detrimental to utility. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility. Our code will be publicly released. WARNING: This paper contains unsafe model responses.</p></details> |  |

Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular parameter-efficient method for adapting pre-trained TSFMs to downstream data domains. However, it still underperforms in financial data, as it preserves the network architecture and training objective of TSFMs rather than complementing the foundation model. To further enhance TSFMs, we propose a novel refinement module, RefineBridge, built upon a tractable Schrödinger Bridge (SB) generative framework. Given the forecasts of TSFM as generative prior and the observed ground truths as targets, RefineBridge learns context-conditioned stochastic transport maps to improve TSFM predictions, iteratively approaching the ground-truth target from even a low-quality prior. Simulations on multiple financial benchmarks demonstrate that RefineBridge consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art TSFMs across different prediction horizons.</p></details> |  |

To enable scalable pretraining on 49,497 fMRI sessions across nine datasets, Omni-fMRI introduces a dynamic patching mechanism that substantially reduces computational cost while preserving informative spatial structure. To support reproducibility and fair comparison, we establish a comprehensive benchmark suite spanning 11 datasets and a diverse set of resting-state and task-based fMRI tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Omni-fMRI consistently outperforms existing foundation models, providing a scalable and reproducible framework for atlas-free brain representation learning.

Atlas-based methods aggregate voxel signals into fixed regions of interest, reducing data dimensionality but discarding fine-grained spatial details, and requiring extremely large cohorts to train effectively as general-purpose foundation models. Atlas-free methods, on the other hand, operate directly on voxel-level information - preserving spatial fidelity but are prohibitively memory- and compute-intensive, making large-scale pre-training infeasible. We introduce SLIM-Brain (Sample-efficient, Low-memory fMRI Foundation Model for Human Brain), a new atlas-free foundation model that simultaneously improves both data- and training-efficiency. SLIM-Brain adopts a two-stage adaptive design: (i) a lightweight temporal extractor captures global context across full sequences and ranks data windows by saliency, and (ii) a 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from the top-$k$ selected windows, while deleting about 70% masked patches. Extensive experiments across seven public benchmarks show that SLIM-Brain establishes new state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks, while requiring only 4 thousand pre-training sessions and approximately 30% of GPU memory comparing to traditional voxel-level methods.</p></details> | release code |

Furthermore, most existing computer-aided diagnosis methods focus on imaging-based models, overlooking the clinical context and suffering from data scarcity, limiting their ability to learn robust representations. We propose a geometric multimodal Foundation Model (FM), named MFM-Geom, that learns representations from bp-MRI and clinical reports, encoding visual findings and information from the context of clinical variables. In the representations classification head, the approach leverages symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices and Riemannian deep learning to integrate imaging-text representations from a biomedical multimodal FM. Using 10% of the training data, MFM-Geom outperformed baseline class token embedding-based classification (+8.3%, AUC-PR of 90.67).

Shapley values are a widely used approach for explaining model predictions, but require direct access to the underlying model, an assumption frequently violated in real-world deployments. Further, even when model access is possible, their exact computation may be prohibitively expensive. We investigate whether meaningful Shapley value estimations can be obtained in a zero-shot setting, using only the input data distribution and no evaluations of the target model. To this end, we introduce ExplainerPFN, a tabular foundation model built on TabPFN that is pretrained on synthetic datasets generated from random structural causal models and supervised using exact or near-exact Shapley values. Once trained, ExplainerPFN predicts feature attributions for unseen tabular datasets without model access, gradients, or example explanations. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) we show that few-shot learning-based explanations can achieve high fidelity to SHAP values with as few as two reference observations; (2) we propose ExplainerPFN, the first zero-shot method for estimating Shapley values without access to the underlying model or reference explanations; (3) we provide an open-source implementation of ExplainerPFN, including the full training pipeline and synthetic data generator; and (4) through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, we show that ExplainerPFN achieves performance competitive with few-shot surrogate explainers that rely on 2-10 SHAP examples.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |

However, the interdisciplinary, fragmented, and fast-evolving expertise in this domain prevents general-purpose LLMs, which lack domain knowledge and physical-constraint awareness, from delivering precise engineering-aligned inference and generation. To address these challenges, we introduce Helios, a large language model tailored to the smart energy domain, together with a comprehensive suite of resources to advance LLM research in this field. Specifically, we develop Enersys, a multi-agent collaborative framework for end-to-end dataset construction, through which we produce: (1) a smart energy knowledge base, EnerBase, to enrich the model's foundational expertise; (2) an instruction fine-tuning dataset, EnerInstruct, to strengthen performance on domain-specific downstream tasks; and (3) an RLHF dataset, EnerReinforce, to align the model with human preferences and industry standards. Leveraging these resources, Helios undergoes large-scale pretraining, SFT, and RLHF. We also release EnerBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in smart energy scenarios, and demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances domain knowledge mastery, task execution accuracy, and alignment with human preferences.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents JudgeGPT and RogueGPT, a dual-axis framework that decouples "authenticity" from "attribution" to investigate the mechanisms of human susceptibility. Analyzing 918 evaluations across five FMs (including GPT-4 and Llama-2), we employ Structural Causal Models (SCMs) as a principal framework for formulating testable causal hypotheses about detection accuracy. Contrary to partisan narratives, we find that political orientation shows a negligible association with detection performance ($r=-0.10$). Instead, "fake news familiarity" emerges as a candidate mediator ($r=0.35$), suggesting that exposure may function as adversarial training for human discriminators. We identify a "fluency trap" where GPT-4 outputs (HumanMachineScore: 0.20) bypass Source Monitoring mechanisms, rendering them indistinguishable from human text. These findings suggest that "pre-bunking" interventions should target cognitive source monitoring rather than demographic segmentation to ensure trustworthy information ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM TheWebConf '26 Companion</p></details> |
| **[How Much of a Model Do We Need? Redundancy and Slimmability in Remote Sensing Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22841v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale foundation models (FMs) in remote sensing (RS) are developed based on the paradigms established in computer vision (CV) and have shown promise for various Earth observation applications. However, the direct transfer of scaling assumptions from CV to RS has not been adequately examined. We hypothesize that RS FMs enter an overparameterized regime at substantially smaller scales than their CV counterparts, where increasing parameter count primarily induces redundant representations rather than qualitatively new abstractions. To test this hypothesis, we use post-hoc slimming, where we uniformly reduce the width of pretrained encoder, as a tool to measure representational redundancy across six state-of-the-art RS FMs on four downstream classification tasks. Our findings reveal a significant contrast with those in the CV domain: while a post-hoc slimmed masked autoencoder (MAE) trained on ImageNet retains less than 10% accuracy at 1% FLOPs, RS FMs maintain over 71% relative accuracy at the same budget. This sevenfold difference provides strong empirical support for our hypothesis. We further demonstrate that learned slimmable training can improve both Momentum Contrast (MoCo)- and MAE- based models. In addition, through the explained variance ratio and the feature correlation analysis, we provide mechanistic explanations showing that RS FMs distribute task-relevant information with high redundancy. Our findings establish post-hoc slimmability as both a practical deployment strategy for resource-constrained environments and a diagnostic tool that challenges the prevailing scaling paradigm in RS. Upon acceptance, we will publish all code.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Blueprints of Intelligence: A Functional-Topological Foundation for Perception and Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05089v4)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world phenomena do not generate arbitrary variability: their signals concentrate on compact, low-variability subsets of functional space, enabling rapid generalization from few examples. A small child can recognize a dog after extremely limited exposure because the perceptual manifold of "dog" is compact, structured, and low-dimensional. We formalize this principle through a deterministic functional-topological framework in which the set of valid realizations produced by a physical process forms a compact subset of a Banach space, endowed with stable invariants, a finite Hausdorff radius, and an induced continuous perceptual functional. This geometry provides explicit limits on knowledge, conditions for identifiability, and guarantees for generalization from sparse evidence -- properties fundamental to both natural and artificial intelligence. Across electromechanical, electrochemical, and physiological domains, we show that real-world processes consistently generate compact perceptual manifolds with the same geometric characteristics. Their boundaries can be discovered in a fully self-supervised manner as the empirical radius saturates with increasing sampling, even when the governing equations are unknown. These results demonstrate that deterministic functional topology offers a unified mathematical foundation for perception, representation, and world-model construction. It provides a geometric explanation for why biological learners and self-supervised AI systems can generalize from few observations, and establishes compact perceptual manifolds as a fundamental building block for future AI architectures. Finally, this work unifies biological perception and modern self-supervised models under a single geometric principle: both derive their generalization ability from the compactness and invariants of real-world perceptual manifolds.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 6 figures.

Existing detection tools are hampered by low-coverage UI interaction, costly instrumentation, and a lack of scalable root-cause analysis. We present Okara, a framework that leverages foundation models to automate the detection and deep attribution of TLS MitM Vulnerabilities (TMVs). Okara's detection component, TMV-Hunter, employs foundation model-driven GUI agents to achieve high-coverage app interaction, enabling efficient vulnerability discovery at scale. Deploying TMV-Hunter on 37,349 apps from Google Play and a third-party store revealed 8,374 (22.42%) vulnerable apps. Our measurement shows these vulnerabilities are widespread across all popularity levels, affect critical functionalities like authentication and code delivery, and are highly persistent with a median vulnerable lifespan of over 1,300 days. Okara's attribution component, TMV-ORCA, combines dynamic instrumentation with a novel LLM-based classifier to locate and categorize vulnerable code according to a comprehensive new taxonomy. This analysis attributes 41% of vulnerabilities to third-party libraries and identifies recurring insecure patterns, such as empty trust managers and flawed hostname verification. We have initiated a large-scale responsible disclosure effort and will release our tools and datasets to support further research and mitigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACISP 2026</p></details> |

| **[Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Mixup Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22581v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) for hyper-spectral image (HSI) classification has attracted significant research interest, existing works often rely on an unrealistic data augmentation procedure in the form of external noise to enlarge the sample size, thus greatly simplifying the issue of data scarcity. They involve a large number of parameters for model updates, being prone to the overfitting problem. To the best of our knowledge, none has explored the strength of the foundation model, having strong generalization power to be quickly adapted to downstream tasks. This paper proposes the MIxup FOundation MOdel (MIFOMO) for CDFSL of HSI classifications. MIFOMO is built upon the concept of a remote sensing (RS) foundation model, pre-trained across a large scale of RS problems, thus featuring generalizable features. The notion of coalescent projection (CP) is introduced to quickly adapt the foundation model to downstream tasks while freezing the backbone network. The concept of mixup domain adaptation (MDM) is proposed to address the extreme domain discrepancy problem. Last but not least, the label smoothing concept is implemented to cope with noisy pseudo-label problems. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of MIFOMO, where it beats prior arts with up to 14% margin. The source code of MIFOMO is open-sourced in https://github.com/Naeem- Paeedeh/MIFOMO for reproducibility and convenient further study.</p></details> |  |

Although machine learning methods have shown encouraging results, progress is hindered by data scarcity and heterogeneity arising from diverse aging conditions. In other fields, foundation models (FMs) trained on diverse datasets have achieved broad generalization through transfer learning, but no FMs have been reported for battery cycle life prediction yet. Here we present the Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT), the first FM for battery life prediction, developed through domain-knowledge-encoded mixture-of-expert layers. Validated on the largest public battery life database, PBT learns transferable representations from 13 lithium-ion battery (LIB) datasets, outperforming existing models by an average of 19.8%. With transfer learning, PBT achieves state-of-the-art performance across 15 diverse datasets encompassing 995 batteries and 537 aging conditions of LIBs, sodium-ion batteries and Zinc-ion batteries. This work establishes a foundation model pathway for battery lifetime prediction, paving the way toward universal battery lifetime prediction systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 fig...</summary><p>5 figures in the main content</p></details> |
| **[Foundation Models for Logistics: Toward Certifiable, Conversational Planning Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11352v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logistics operators, from battlefield coordinators re-routing airlifts ahead of a storm to warehouse managers juggling late trucks, need to make mission-critical decisions. Prevailing methods for logistics planning such as integer programming yield plans that satisfy user-defined logical constraints, assuming an idealized mathematical model of the environment. On the other hand, foundation models lower the intermediate processing barrier by translating natural-language user utterances into executable plans, yet they remain prone to misinterpretations and hallucinations that jeopardize safety and cost. We introduce a Vision-Language Logistics (VLL) agent, built on a neurosymbolic framework that pairs the accessibility of natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on user-objective interpretation. The agent interprets user requests and converts them into structured planning specifications, quantifies the uncertainty of the interpretation, and invokes an interactive clarification loop when the uncertainty exceeds an adaptive threshold. Drawing on a lightweight airlift logistics planning use case as an illustrative case study, we highlight a practical path toward certifiable and user-aligned decision-making for complex logistics. Our lightweight model, fine-tuned on just 100 training samples, surpasses the zero-shot performance of 20x larger models in logistic planning tasks while cutting inference latency by nearly 50%.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAP: Two-Stage Adaptive Personalization of Multi-Task and Multi-Modal Foundation Models in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26524v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In federated learning (FL), local personalization of models has received significant attention, yet personalized fine-tuning of foundation models remains a significant challenge. In particular, there is a lack of understanding in the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize foundation models in settings that are heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and modalities. To address this gap, we propose TAP (Two-Stage Adaptive Personalization), which has two key features: (i) leveraging mismatched model architectures between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations when it benefits a client's local tasks; (ii) engaging in post-FL knowledge distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising personalization. In developing TAP, we introduce the first convergence analysis of federated foundation model training at the server under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to state-of-the-art federated personalization baselines.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[FIRE: Multi-fidelity Regression with Distribution-conditioned In-context Learning using Tabular Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22371v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-fidelity (MF) regression often operates in regimes of extreme data imbalance, where the commonly-used Gaussian-process (GP) surrogates struggle with cubic scaling costs and overfit to sparse high-fidelity observations, limiting efficiency and generalization in real-world applications. We introduce FIRE, a training-free MF framework that couples tabular foundation models (TFMs) to perform zero-shot in-context Bayesian inference via a high-fidelity correction model conditioned on the low-fidelity model's posterior predictive distributions. This cross-fidelity information transfer via distributional summaries captures heteroscedastic errors, enabling robust residual learning without model retraining. Across 31 benchmark problems spanning synthetic and real-world tasks (e.g., DrivAerNet, LCBench), FIRE delivers a stronger performance-time trade-off than seven state-of-the-art GP-based or deep learning MF regression methods, ranking highest in accuracy and uncertainty quantification with runtime advantages. Limitations include context window constraints and dependence on the quality of the pre-trained TFM's.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCALAR: Quantifying Structural Hallucination, Consistency, and Reasoning Gaps in Materials Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22312v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are increasingly applied to materials science reasoning, yet their behavior under physically structured distribution shifts remains poorly understood. We introduce SCALAR (Structural Consistency And Logic Across Regimes), a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination, consistency, and reasoning in materials foundation models. Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity. These results demonstrate that geometric scale generalization cannot be inferred from accuracy alone.

| **[Tabular Foundation Models Can Do Survival Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22259v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While tabular foundation models have achieved remarkable success in classification and regression, adapting them to model time-to-event outcomes for survival analysis is non-trivial due to right-censoring, where data observations may end before the event occurs. We develop a classification-based framework that reformulates both static and dynamic survival analysis as a series of binary classification problems by discretizing event times. Censored observations are naturally handled as examples with missing labels at certain time points. This classification formulation enables existing tabular foundation models to perform survival analysis through in-context learning without explicit training. We prove that under standard censoring assumptions, minimizing our binary classification loss recovers the true survival probabilities as the training set size increases. We demonstrate through evaluation across $53$ real-world datasets that off-the-shelf tabular foundation models with this classification formulation outperform classical and deep learning baselines on average over multiple survival metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[MORPH: PDE Foundation Models with Arbitrary Data Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21670v4)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MORPH, a modality-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data modality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, and multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorize full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters, MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from the heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning. The source code, datasets, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/lanl/MORPH.</p></details> |  |
| **[Making Foundation Models Probabilistic via Singular Value Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22068v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have become a dominant paradigm in machine learning, achieving remarkable performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining. However, these models often yield overconfident, uncalibrated predictions. The standard approach to quantifying epistemic uncertainty, training an ensemble of independent models, incurs prohibitive computational costs that scale linearly with ensemble size, making it impractical for large foundation models. We propose Singular Value Ensemble (SVE), a parameter-efficient implicit ensemble method that builds on a simple, but powerful core assumption: namely, that the singular vectors of the weight matrices constitute meaningful subspaces of the model's knowledge. Pretrained foundation models encode rich, transferable information in their weight matrices. If the singular vectors are indeed meaningful (orthogonal) "knowledge directions". To obtain a model ensemble, we modulate only how strongly each direction contributes to the output. Rather than learning entirely new parameters, we freeze the singular vectors and only train per-member singular values that rescale the contribution of each direction in that shared knowledge basis. Ensemble diversity emerges naturally as stochastic initialization and random sampling of mini-batches during joint training cause different members to converge to different combinations of the same underlying knowledge. SVE achieves uncertainty quantification comparable to explicit deep ensembles while increasing the parameter count of the base model by less than 1%, making principled uncertainty estimation accessible in resource-constrained settings. We validate SVE on NLP and vision tasks with various different backbones and show that it improves calibration while maintaining predictive accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Conditional Computation: Retrieval-Augmented Genomic Foundation Models with Gengram](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22203v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current genomic foundation models (GFMs) rely on extensive neural computation to implicitly approximate conserved biological motifs from single-nucleotide inputs. We propose Gengram, a conditional memory module that introduces an explicit and highly efficient lookup primitive for multi-base motifs via a genomic-specific hashing scheme, establishing genomic "syntax". Integrated into the backbone of state-of-the-art GFMs, Gengram achieves substantial gains (up to 14%) across several functional genomics tasks. The module demonstrates robust architectural generalization, while further inspection of Gengram's latent space reveals the emergence of meaningful representations that align closely with fundamental biological knowledge. By establishing structured motif memory as a modeling primitive, Gengram simultaneously boosts empirical performance and mechanistic interpretability, providing a scalable and biology-aligned pathway for the next generation of GFMs. The code is available at https://github.com/zhejianglab/Genos, and the model checkpoint is available at https://huggingface.co/ZhejiangLab/Gengram.</p></details> |  |
| **[Elign: Equivariant Diffusion Model Alignment from Foundational Machine Learning Force Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21985v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models for 3D molecular conformations must respect Euclidean symmetries and concentrate probability mass on thermodynamically favorable, mechanically stable structures. However, E(3)-equivariant diffusion models often reproduce biases from semi-empirical training data rather than capturing the equilibrium distribution of a high-fidelity Hamiltonian. While physics-based guidance can correct this, it faces two computational bottlenecks: expensive quantum-chemical evaluations (e.g., DFT) and the need to repeat such queries at every sampling step. We present Elign, a post-training framework that amortizes both costs. First, we replace expensive DFT evaluations with a faster, pretrained foundational machine-learning force field (MLFF) to provide physical signals. Second, we eliminate repeated run-time queries by shifting physical steering to the training phase. To achieve the second amortization, we formulate reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce Force--Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO) to fine-tune the denoising policy. FED-GRPO includes a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, which are optimized and group-normalized independently. Experiments show that Elign generates conformations with lower gold-standard DFT energies and forces, while improving stability. Crucially, inference remains as fast as unguided sampling, since no energy evaluations are required during generation.</p></details> |  |

Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive, cost-effective modality for capturing neural activity, though traditional methods often struggle with cross-subject variability and task-specific preprocessing. We propose leveraging Brain Foundation Models (BFMs), large pre-trained neural networks, to extract generalizable EEG features for cognitive load estimation. We adapt BFMs for long-term EEG monitoring and show that fine-tuning a small subset of layers yields improved accuracy over the state-of-the-art. Despite their scale, BFMs allow for real-time inference with a longer context window. To address often-overlooked interpretability challenges, we apply Partition SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify feature importance. Our findings reveal consistent emphasis on prefrontal regions linked to cognitive control, while longitudinal trends suggest learning progression. These results position BFMs as efficient and interpretable tools for continuous cognitive load monitoring in real-world BCIs.</p></details> |  |

Existing mitigation methods often rely on unavailable group labels or computationally expensive gradient-based adversarial optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Visual Disentangled Diffusion Autoencoders (DiDAE), a novel framework integrating frozen foundation models with disentangled dictionary learning for efficient, gradient-free counterfactual generation directly for the foundation model. DiDAE first edits foundation model embeddings in interpretable disentangled directions of the disentangled dictionary and then decodes them via a diffusion autoencoder. This allows the generation of multiple diverse, disentangled counterfactuals for each factual, much faster than existing baselines, which generate single entangled counterfactuals. When paired with Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation, DiDAE-CFKD achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating shortcut learning, improving downstream performance on unbalanced datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Looking Beyond Accuracy: A Holistic Benchmark of ECG Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21830v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a cost-effective, highly accessible and widely employed diagnostic tool. With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings. However, to responsibly employ FMs, it is crucial to rigorously assess to which extent the embeddings they produce are generalizable, particularly in error-sensitive domains such as healthcare. Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios. Experimental results show that our benchmarking protocol provides a rich insight of ECG-expert FMs' embedded patterns, enabling a deeper understanding of their representational structure and generalizability.</p></details> |  |

Using a literature review and thematic analysis, we curated exemplar folklore items (e.g., beliefs about where defects occur, the 10x developer legend, and technical debt). We analyzed their narrative form, symbolic meaning, occupational relevance, and links to knowledge areas in software engineering. To ground these concepts in practice, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 industrial practitioners in Sweden to explore how such narratives are recognized or transmitted within their daily work and how they affect it. Synthesizing these results, we propose a working definition of software engineering folklore as informally transmitted, traditional, and emergent narratives and heuristics enacted within occupational folk groups that shape identity, values, and collective knowledge. We argue that making the concept of software engineering folklore explicit provides a foundation for subsequent ethnography and folklore studies and for reflective practice that can preserve context-effective heuristics while challenging unhelpful folklore.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHASE 2026 (19th International Conference on Cooperative and Human Aspects of Software Engineering), co-located with ICSE 2026</p></details> |

However, their clinical applicability is often limited by performance gaps compared to task-specific models, even after pre-training on large ECG datasets and fine-tuning on target data. This limitation is likely due to the lack of an effective post-training strategy. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-training approach to enhance ECG foundation models. We evaluate it on a publicly available Transformer-based foundation model. Experiments across multiple ECG tasks show that our method consistently outperforms baseline fine-tuning. On the PTB-XL benchmarks, it improves macro AUROC by 0.7%-8.9% and macro AUPRC by 23.3%-77.9%, also outperforming several recent state-of-the-art approaches, including task-specific and advanced architectures. Further analyses demonstrate improved training dynamics and data efficiency, with only 30% of the training data outperforming the baseline trained on the full dataset. Ablation studies highlight the importance of stochastic depth and preview linear probing. These findings underscore the potential of post-training strategies to improve ECG foundation models, and we hope this work will contribute to the continued development of foundation models in the ECG domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>A Tra...</summary><p>A Transformer-based model is used as an example; the proposed post-training strategy may also be applicable to CNN-based models.
