| **[GripMap: An Efficient, Spatially Resolved Constraint Framework for Offline and Online Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Racing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12115v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional trajectory planning approaches for autonomous vehicles often assume a fixed vehicle model that remains constant regardless of the vehicle's location. This overlooks the critical fact that the tires and the surface are the two force-transmitting partners in vehicle dynamics; while the tires stay with the vehicle, surface conditions vary with location. Recognizing these challenges, this paper presents a novel framework for spatially resolving dynamic constraints in both offline and online planning algorithms applied to autonomous racing. We introduce the GripMap concept, which provides a spatial resolution of vehicle dynamic constraints in the Frenet frame, allowing adaptation to locally varying grip conditions. This enables compensation for location-specific effects, more efficient vehicle behavior, and increased safety, unattainable with spatially invariant vehicle models. The focus is on low storage demand and quick access through perfect hashing. This framework proved advantageous in real-world applications in the presented form. Experiments inspired by autonomous racing demonstrate its effectiveness. In future work, this framework can serve as a foundational layer for developing future interpretable learning algorithms that adjust to varying grip conditions in real-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-shot Star-convex Polygon-based Instance Segmentation for Spatially-correlated Biomedical Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12078v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical images often contain objects known to be spatially correlated or nested due to their inherent properties, leading to semantic relations. Examples include cell nuclei being nested within eukaryotic cells and colonies growing exclusively within their culture dishes. While these semantic relations bear key importance, detection tasks are often formulated independently, requiring multi-shot analysis pipelines. Importantly, spatial correlation could constitute a fundamental prior facilitating learning of more meaningful representations for tasks like instance segmentation. This knowledge has, thus far, not been utilised by the biomedical computer vision community. We argue that the instance segmentation of two or more categories of objects can be achieved in parallel. We achieve this via two architectures HydraStarDist (HSD) and the novel (HSD-WBR) based on the widely-used StarDist (SD), to take advantage of the star-convexity of our target objects. HSD and HSD-WBR are constructed to be capable of incorporating their interactions as constraints into account. HSD implicitly incorporates spatial correlation priors based on object interaction through a joint encoder. HSD-WBR further enforces the prior in a regularisation layer with the penalty we proposed named Within Boundary Regularisation Penalty (WBR). Both architectures achieve nested instance segmentation in a single shot. We demonstrate their competitiveness based on $IoU_R$ and AP and superiority in a new, task-relevant criteria, Joint TP rate (JTPR) compared to their baseline SD and Cellpose. Our approach can be further modified to capture partial-inclusion/-exclusion in multi-object interactions in fluorescent or brightfield microscopy or digital imaging. Finally, our strategy suggests gains by making this learning single-shot and computationally efficient.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Local Clustering and Global Spreading of Receptors for Optimal Spatial Gradient Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03395v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial information from cell-surface receptors is crucial for processes that require signal processing and sensing of the environment. Here, we investigate the optimal placement of such receptors through a theoretical model that minimizes uncertainty in gradient estimation. Without requiring a priori knowledge of the physical limits of sensing or biochemical processes, we reproduce the emergence of clusters that closely resemble those observed in real cells. On perfect spherical surfaces, optimally placed receptors spread uniformly. When perturbations break their symmetry, receptors cluster in regions of high curvature, massively reducing estimation uncertainty. This agrees with mechanistic models that minimize elastic preference discrepancies between receptors and cell membranes. We further extend our model to motile receptors responding to cell-shape changes and external fluid flow, demonstrating the relevance of our model in realistic scenarios. Our findings provide a simple and utilitarian explanation for receptor clustering at high-curvature regions when high sensing accuracy is paramount.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version has been accepted for publication in Physical Review Letters.

| **[A Spatial-Sign based Direct Approach for High Dimensional Sparse Quadratic Discriminant Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11187v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the problem of high-dimensional sparse quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). We propose a novel classification method, termed SSQDA, which is constructed via constrained convex optimization based on the sample spatial median and spatial sign covariance matrix under the assumption of an elliptically symmetric distribution. The proposed classifier is shown to achieve the optimal convergence rate over a broad class of parameter spaces, up to a logarithmic factor. Extensive simulation studies and real data applications demonstrate that SSQDA is both robust and efficient, particularly in the presence of heavy-tailed distributions, highlighting its practical advantages in high-dimensional classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ESTA: An Efficient Spatial-Temporal Range Aggregation Query Processing Algorithm for UAV Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11977v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks are increasingly deployed in military and civilian applications, serving as critical platforms for data collection. Users frequently require aggregated statistical information derived from historical sensory data within specific spatial and temporal boundaries. To address this, users submit aggregation query requests with spatial-temporal constraints to target UAVs that store the relevant data. These UAVs process and return the query results, which can be aggregated within the network during transmission to conserve energy and bandwidth-resources that are inherently limited in UAV networks. However,the dynamic topology caused by UAV mobility, coupled with these resource constraints, makes efficient in-network aggregation challenging without compromising user query delay. To the best of our knowledge, existing research has yet to adequately explore spatial-temporal range aggregation queries in the context of UAV networks. In this paper, we propose ESTA, an Efficient Spatial-Temporal range Aggregation query processing algorithm tailored for UAV networks. ESTA leverages pre-planned UAV trajectories to construct a topology change graph that models the network's evolving connectivity. It then employs an efficient shortest path algorithm to determine the minimum query response delay. Subsequently, while adhering to user-specified delay constraints, ESTA transforms the in-network aggregation process into a series of set cover problems, which are solved recursively to build a Spatial-Temporal Aggregation Tree (STAT). This tree enables the identification of an energy-efficient routing path for aggregating and delivering query results. Extensive simulations demonstrate that ESTA reduces energy consumption by more than 50% compared to a baseline algorithm, all while satisfying the required query delay.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |
| **[BrickSmart: Leveraging Generative AI to Support Children's Spatial Language Learning in Family Block Play](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11138v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Block-building activities are crucial for developing children's spatial reasoning and mathematical skills, yet parents often lack the expertise to guide these activities effectively. BrickSmart, a pioneering system, addresses this gap by providing spatial language guidance through a structured three-step process: Discovery & Design, Build & Learn, and Explore & Expand. This system uniquely supports parents in 1) generating personalized block-building instructions, 2) guiding parents to teach spatial language during building and interactive play, and 3) tracking children's learning progress, altogether enhancing children's engagement and cognitive development. In a comparative study involving 12 parent-child pairs children aged 6-8 years) for both experimental and control groups, BrickSmart demonstrated improvements in supportiveness, efficiency, and innovation, with a significant increase in children's use of spatial vocabularies during block play, thereby offering an effective framework for fostering spatial language skills in children.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Point Processes and spatial statistics in time-frequency analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19172v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A finite-energy signal is represented by a square-integrable, complex-valued function $t\mapsto s(t)$ of a real variable $t$, interpreted as time. Similarly, a noisy signal is represented by a random process. Time-frequency analysis, a subfield of signal processing, amounts to describing the temporal evolution of the frequency content of a signal. Loosely speaking, if $s$ is the audio recording of a musical piece, time-frequency analysis somehow consists in writing the musical score of the piece. Mathematically, the operation is performed through a transform $\mathcal{V}$, mapping $s \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ onto a complex-valued function $\mathcal{V}s \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ of time $t$ and angular frequency $\omega$. The squared modulus $(t, \omega) \mapsto \vert\mathcal{V}s(t,\omega)\vert^2$ of the time-frequency representation is known as the spectrogram of $s$; in the musical score analogy, a peaked spectrogram at $(t_0,\omega_0)$ corresponds to a musical note at angular frequency $\omega_0$ localized at time $t_0$. More generally, the intuition is that upper level sets of the spectrogram contain relevant information about in the original signal. Hence, many signal processing algorithms revolve around identifying maxima of the spectrogram. In contrast, zeros of the spectrogram indicate perfect silence, that is, a time at which a particular frequency is absent. Assimilating $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{C}$ through $z = \omega + \mathrm{i}t$, this chapter focuses on time-frequency transforms $\mathcal{V}$ that map signals to analytic functions. The zeros of the spectrogram of a noisy signal are then the zeros of a random analytic function, hence forming a Point Process in $\mathbb{C}$. This chapter is devoted to the study of these Point Processes, to their links with zeros of Gaussian Analytic Functions, and to designing signal detection and denoising algorithms using spatial statistics.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published as a chapter of the book "Stochastic Geometry: Percolation, Tesselations, Gaussian Fields and Point Processes"</p></details> |
| **[Towards Spatially-Aware and Optimally Faithful Concept-Based Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10833v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-hoc, unsupervised concept-based explanation methods (U-CBEMs) are a promising tool for generating semantic explanations of the decision-making processes in deep neural networks, having applications in both model improvement and understanding. It is vital that the explanation is accurate, or faithful, to the model, yet we identify several limitations of prior faithfulness metrics that inhibit an accurate evaluation; most notably, prior metrics involve only the set of concepts present, ignoring how they may be spatially distributed. We address these limitations with Surrogate Faithfulness (SF), an evaluation method that introduces a spatially-aware surrogate and two novel faithfulness metrics. Using SF, we produce Optimally Faithful (OF) explanations, where concepts are found that maximize faithfulness. Our experiments show that (1) adding spatial-awareness to prior U-CBEMs increases faithfulness in all cases; (2) OF produces significantly more faithful explanations than prior U-CBEMs (30% or higher improvement in error); (3) OF's learned concepts generalize well to out-of-domain data and are more robust to adversarial examples, where prior U-CBEMs struggle.</p></details> |  |
| **[GaSLight: Gaussian Splats for Spatially-Varying Lighting in HDR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10809v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GaSLight, a method that generates spatially-varying lighting from regular images. Our method proposes using HDR Gaussian Splats as light source representation, marking the first time regular images can serve as light sources in a 3D renderer. Our two-stage process first enhances the dynamic range of images plausibly and accurately by leveraging the priors embedded in diffusion models. Next, we employ Gaussian Splats to model 3D lighting, achieving spatially variant lighting. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results on HDR estimations and their applications in illuminating virtual objects and scenes. To facilitate the benchmarking of images as light sources, we introduce a novel dataset of calibrated and unsaturated HDR to evaluate images as light sources. We assess our method using a combination of this novel dataset and an existing dataset from the literature. The code to reproduce our method will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Visual-Spatial Reasoning via R1-Zero-Like Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00883v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasing attention has been placed on improving the reasoning capacities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). As the cornerstone for AI agents that function in the physical realm, video-based visual-spatial intelligence (VSI) emerges as one of the most pivotal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. This work conducts a first, in-depth study on improving the visual-spatial reasoning of MLLMs via R1-Zero-like training. Technically, we first identify that the visual-spatial reasoning capacities of small- to medium-sized Qwen2-VL models cannot be activated via Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts. We then incorporate GRPO training for improved visual-spatial reasoning, using the carefully curated VSI-100k dataset, following DeepSeek-R1-Zero. During the investigation, we identify the necessity to keep the KL penalty (even with a small value) in GRPO. With just 120 GPU hours, our vsGRPO-2B model, fine-tuned from Qwen2-VL-2B, can outperform the base model by 12.1% and surpass GPT-4o. Moreover, our vsGRPO-7B model, fine-tuned from Qwen2-VL-7B, achieves performance comparable to that of the best open-source model LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B. Additionally, we compare vsGRPO to supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization baselines and observe strong performance superiority. The code and dataset will be available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Skeleton-Based Intake Gesture Detection With Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10635v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Overweight and obesity have emerged as widespread societal challenges, frequently linked to unhealthy eating patterns. A promising approach to enhance dietary monitoring in everyday life involves automated detection of food intake gestures. This study introduces a skeleton based approach using a model that combines a dilated spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) with a bidirectional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM) framework, as called ST-GCN-BiLSTM, to detect intake gestures. The skeleton-based method provides key benefits, including environmental robustness, reduced data dependency, and enhanced privacy preservation. Two datasets were employed for model validation. The OREBA dataset, which consists of laboratory-recorded videos, achieved segmental F1-scores of 86.18% and 74.84% for identifying eating and drinking gestures. Additionally, a self-collected dataset using smartphone recordings in more adaptable experimental conditions was evaluated with the model trained on OREBA, yielding F1-scores of 85.40% and 67.80% for detecting eating and drinking gestures. The results not only confirm the feasibility of utilizing skeleton data for intake gesture detection but also highlight the robustness of the proposed approach in cross-dataset validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript has been accepted in 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (IEEE EMBC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[GeOT: A spatially explicit framework for evaluating spatio-temporal predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11709v3)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When predicting observations across space and time, the spatial layout of errors impacts a model's real-world utility. For instance, in bike sharing demand prediction, error patterns translate to relocation costs. However, commonly used error metrics in GeoAI evaluate predictions point-wise, neglecting effects such as spatial heterogeneity, autocorrelation, and the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem. We put forward Optimal Transport (OT) as a spatial evaluation metric and loss function. The proposed framework, called GeOT, assesses the performance of prediction models by quantifying the transport costs associated with their prediction errors. Through experiments on real and synthetic data, we demonstrate that 1) the spatial distribution of prediction errors relates to real-world costs in many applications, 2) OT captures these spatial costs more accurately than existing metrics, and 3) OT enhances comparability across spatial and temporal scales. Finally, we advocate for leveraging OT as a loss function in neural networks to improve the spatial accuracy of predictions. Experiments with bike sharing, charging station, and traffic datasets show that spatial costs are significantly reduced with only marginal changes to non-spatial error metrics. Thus, this approach not only offers a spatially explicit tool for model evaluation and selection, but also integrates spatial considerations into model training. All code is available at https://github.com/mie-lab/geospatialOT.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Large Language Model-Powered Spatial Intelligence Across Scales: Advances in Embodied Agents, Smart Cities, and Earth Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09848v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past year, the development of large language models (LLMs) has brought spatial intelligence into focus, with much attention on vision-based embodied intelligence. However, spatial intelligence spans a broader range of disciplines and scales, from navigation and urban planning to remote sensing and earth science. What are the differences and connections between spatial intelligence across these fields? In this paper, we first review human spatial cognition and its implications for spatial intelligence in LLMs. We then examine spatial memory, knowledge representations, and abstract reasoning in LLMs, highlighting their roles and connections. Finally, we analyze spatial intelligence across scales -- from embodied to urban and global levels -- following a framework that progresses from spatial memory and understanding to spatial reasoning and intelligence. Through this survey, we aim to provide insights into interdisciplinary spatial intelligence research and inspire future studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[FUSION: Frequency-guided Underwater Spatial Image recOnstructioN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01243v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater images suffer from severe degradations, including color distortions, reduced visibility, and loss of structural details due to wavelength-dependent attenuation and scattering. Existing enhancement methods primarily focus on spatial-domain processing, neglecting the frequency domain's potential to capture global color distributions and long-range dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose FUSION, a dual-domain deep learning framework that jointly leverages spatial and frequency domain information. FUSION independently processes each RGB channel through multi-scale convolutional kernels and adaptive attention mechanisms in the spatial domain, while simultaneously extracting global structural information via FFT-based frequency attention. A Frequency Guided Fusion module integrates complementary features from both domains, followed by inter-channel fusion and adaptive channel recalibration to ensure balanced color distributions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (UIEB, EUVP, SUIM-E) demonstrate that FUSION achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing methods in reconstruction fidelity (highest PSNR of 23.717 dB and SSIM of 0.883 on UIEB), perceptual quality (lowest LPIPS of 0.112 on UIEB), and visual enhancement metrics (best UIQM of 3.414 on UIEB), while requiring significantly fewer parameters (0.28M) and lower computational complexity, demonstrating its suitability for real-time underwater imaging applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrated Bayesian non-parametric spatial modeling for cross-sample identification of spatially variable genes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09654v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized tissue analysis by simultaneously mapping gene expression, spatial topography, and histological context across consecutive tissue sections, enabling systematic investigation of spatial heterogeneity. The detection of spatially variable (SV) genes-molecular signatures with position-dependent expression-provides critical insights into disease mechanisms spanning oncology, neurology, and cardiovascular research. Current methodologies, however, confront dual constraints: predominant reliance on predefined spatial pattern templates restricts detection of novel complex spatial architectures, and inconsistent sample selection strategies compromise analytical stability and biological interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical framework incorporating non-parametric spatial modeling and across-sample integration. It takes advantage of the non-parametric technique and develops an adaptive spatial process accommodating complex pattern discovery. A novel cross-sample bi-level shrinkage prior is further introduced for robust multi-sample SV gene detection, facilitating more effective information fusion. An efficient variational inference is developed for posterior inference ensuring computational scalability. This architecture synergistically addresses spatial complexity through adaptive pattern learning while maintaining biological interpretability. Comprehensive simulations and empirical analyzes confirm the improved performance of the proposed method in resolving complex spatial expression patterns compared to existing analytical frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially Directional Dual-Attention GAT for Spatial Fluoride Health Risk Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09416v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environmental exposure to fluoride is a major public health concern, particularly in regions with naturally elevated fluoride concentrations. Accurate modeling of fluoride-related health risks, such as dental fluorosis, requires spatially aware learning frameworks capable of capturing both geographic and semantic heterogeneity. In this work, we propose Spatially Directional Dual-Attention Graph Attention Network (SDD-GAT), a novel spatial graph neural network designed for fine-grained health risk prediction. SDD-GAT introduces a dual-graph architecture that disentangles geographic proximity and attribute similarity, and incorporates a directional attention mechanism that explicitly encodes spatial orientation and distance into the message passing process. To further enhance spatial coherence, we introduce a spatial smoothness regularization term that enforces consistency in predictions across neighboring locations. We evaluate SDD-GAT on a large-scale dataset covering over 50,000 fluoride monitoring samples and fluorosis records across Guizhou Province, China. Results show that SDD-GAT significantly outperforms traditional models and state-of-the-art GNNs in both regression and classification tasks, while also exhibiting improved spatial autocorrelation as measured by Moran's I. Our framework provides a generalizable foundation for spatial health risk modeling and geospatial learning under complex environmental settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIBES: Exploring Viewer Spatial Interactions as Direct Input for Livestreamed Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09016v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Livestreaming has rapidly become a popular online pastime, with real-time interaction between streamer and viewer being a key motivating feature. However, viewers have traditionally had limited opportunity to directly influence the streamed content; even when such interactions are possible, it has been reliant on text-based chat. We investigate the potential of spatial interaction on the livestreamed video content as a form of direct, real-time input for livestreamed applications. We developed VIBES, a flexible digital system that registers viewers' mouse interactions on the streamed video, i.e., clicks or movements, and transmits it directly into the streamed application. We used VIBES as a technology probe; first designing possible demonstrative interactions and using these interactions to explore streamers' perception of viewer influence and possible challenges and opportunities. We then deployed applications built using VIBES in two livestreams to explore its effects on audience engagement and investigate their relationships with the stream, the streamer, and fellow audience members. The use of spatial interactions enhances engagement and participation and opens up new avenues for both streamer-viewer and viewer-viewer participation. We contextualize our findings around a broader understanding of motivations and engagement in livestreaming, and we propose design guidelines and extensions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, to be published in the ACM International Conference on Interactive Media Experiences (IMX'25)</p></details> |
| **[Addressing Duplicated Data in Spatial Point Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15192v3)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial point process models are widely applied to point pattern data from various applications in the social and environmental sciences. However, a serious hurdle in fitting point process models is the presence of duplicated points, wherein multiple observations share identical spatial coordinates. This often occurs because of decisions made in the geo-coding process, such as assigning representative locations (e.g., aggregate-level centroids) to observations when data producers lack exact location information. Because spatial point process models like the Log-Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP) assume unique locations, researchers often employ ad hoc solutions (e.g., removing duplicates or jittering) to address duplicated data before analysis. As an alternative, this study proposes a Modified Minimum Contrast (MMC) method that adapts the inference procedure to account for the effect of duplicates in estimation, without needing to alter the data. The proposed MMC method is applied to LGCP models, focusing on the inference of second-order intensity parameters, which govern the clustering structure of point patterns. Under a variety of simulated conditions, our results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed MMC method compared to existing ad hoc solutions. We then apply the MMC methods to a real-data application of conflict events in Afghanistan (2008-2009).</p></details> |  |
| **[An Instrumental Variables Framework to Unite Spatial Confounding Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10381v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studies investigating the causal effects of spatially varying exposures on human health often rely on observational and spatially indexed data. A prevalent challenge is unmeasured spatial confounding, where an unobserved spatially varying variable affects both exposure and outcome, leading to biased estimates and invalid confidence intervals. There is a very large literature on spatial statistics that attempts to address unmeasured spatial confounding bias; most of this literature is not framed in the context of causal inference and relies on strict assumptions. In this paper, we introduce a foundational instrumental variables (IV) framework that unites many of the existing approaches designed to account for unmeasured spatial confounding bias. Using the newly introduced framework, we show that many existing approaches are in fact IV methods, where small-scale variation in exposure is the instrument. By mapping each approach to our framework, we explicitly derive its underlying assumptions and estimation strategy. We further provide theoretical arguments that enable the IV framework to identify a general class of causal effects, including the exposure response curve, without assuming a linear outcome model. We apply our methodology to a national data set of 33,255 zip codes to estimate the effect of enforcing air pollution exposure levels below 6-12 $\mu g/m^3$ on all-cause mortality while adjusting for unmeasured spatial confounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages with 13 figures and tables</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Audio Processing with Large Language Model on Wearable Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08907v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating spatial context into large language models (LLMs) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, particularly in wearable devices. In this work, we present a novel system architecture that incorporates spatial speech understanding into LLMs, enabling contextually aware and adaptive applications for wearable technologies. Our approach leverages microstructure-based spatial sensing to extract precise Direction of Arrival (DoA) information using a monaural microphone. To address the lack of existing dataset for microstructure-assisted speech recordings, we synthetically create a dataset called OmniTalk by using the LibriSpeech dataset. This spatial information is fused with linguistic embeddings from OpenAI's Whisper model, allowing each modality to learn complementary contextual representations. The fused embeddings are aligned with the input space of LLaMA-3.2 3B model and fine-tuned with lightweight adaptation technique LoRA to optimize for on-device processing. SING supports spatially-aware automatic speech recognition (ASR), achieving a mean error of $25.72^\circ$-a substantial improvement compared to the 88.52$^\circ$ median error in existing work-with a word error rate (WER) of 5.3. SING also supports soundscaping, for example, inference how many people were talking and their directions, with up to 5 people and a median DoA error of 16$^\circ$. Our system demonstrates superior performance in spatial speech understanding while addressing the challenges of power efficiency, privacy, and hardware constraints, paving the way for advanced applications in augmented reality, accessibility, and immersive experiences.</p></details> |  |

To ensure reliable support, these models require high technological, spatial, and temporal resolution, leading to large-scale linear programming problems that are often computationally intractable. To address this challenge, conventional approaches rely on simplifying abstractions that trade accuracy for computational efficiency. Benders decomposition has been widely explored to improve computational efficiency in electricity capacity expansion models. Specifically, state-of-the-art methods have primarily focused on improving performance through temporal decomposition. However, multi-sector models introduce additional complexity, requiring new decomposition strategies. In this work, we propose a budget-based formulation to extend decomposition to the sectoral and spatial domains. We test the developed sectoral and spatial Benders decomposition algorithms on case studies of the continental United States, considering different configurations in terms of spatial and temporal resolution. Results show that our algorithms achieve substantial performance improvement compared to existing decomposition algorithms, with runtime reductions within 15%-70%. The proposed methods leverage the generic structure of multi-sector capacity expansion models, and can thus be applied to most existing energy planning models, ensuring computational tractability without sacrificing resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Elsevier for possible publication</p></details> |

Recently, adopted event oriented multi-track methods affect the generality in polyphonic environments due to the limitation of the number of tracks. To enhance the generality in polyphonic environments, we propose Spatial Mapping and Regression Localization for SELD (SMRL-SELD). SMRL-SELD segments the 3D spatial space, mapping it to a 2D plane, and a new regression localization loss is proposed to help the results converge toward the location of the corresponding event. SMRL-SELD is location-oriented, allowing the model to learn event features based on orientation. Thus, the method enables the model to process polyphonic sounds regardless of the number of overlapping events. We conducted experiments on STARSS23 and STARSS22 datasets and our proposed SMRL-SELD outperforms the existing SELD methods in overall evaluation and polyphony environments.</p></details> |  |

These archetypes encapsulate the topological relationships between data entities and the execution flow in a structured manner, enabling more expressive and semantically rich computations over interconnected data structures or finite states. By formalizing the relationships between data elements in this topological space, our approach allows for more intuitive modeling of complex systems where a topology of connections is formed for the underlying computational model. This paradigm addresses limitations in traditional OOP when representing a wide range of problems in computer science such as agent-based systems, social networks, processing on relational data, neural networks, distributed systems, finite state machines, and other spatially-oriented computational problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 41 pages with appendix</p></details> |

While state-space networks, including Mamba, a revolutionary advancement in recurrent neural networks, typically scan input sequences from left to right, they face difficulties in designing effective scanning strategies, especially in the processing of image data. Our method demonstrates that integrating wavelet transformation into Mamba enhances the local structure awareness of visual inputs and better captures long-range relations of frequencies by disentangling them into wavelet subbands, representing both low- and high-frequency components. These wavelet-based outputs are then processed and seamlessly fused with the original Mamba outputs through a cross-attention fusion layer, combining both spatial and frequency information to optimize the order awareness of state-space models which is essential for the details and overall quality of image generation. Besides, we introduce a globally-shared transformer to supercharge the performance of Mamba, harnessing its exceptional power to capture global relationships. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, our method demonstrates superior results compared to DiT and DIFFUSSM, achieving faster training convergence and delivering high-quality outputs.

Most of models use either independent modules to separately extract temporal and spatial correlations or joint modules to synchronously extract them, without considering the spatial-temporal correlations. Moreover, models that consider joint spatial-temporal correlations (temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal correlations) often encounter significant challenges in accuracy and computational efficiency which prevent such models from demonstrating the expected advantages of a joint spatial-temporal correlations architecture. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient pure convolutional network for traffic prediction via spatial-temporal encoding and inferring (STEI-PCN). The model introduces and designs a dynamic adjacency matrix inferring module based on absolute spatial and temporal coordinates, as well as relative spatial and temporal distance encoding, using a graph convolutional network combined with gating mechanism to capture local synchronous joint spatial-temporal correlations. Additionally, three layers of temporal dilated causal convolutional network are used to capture long-range temporal correlations. Finally, through multi-view collaborative prediction module, the model integrates the gated-activated original, local synchronous joint spatial-temporal, and long-range temporal features to achieve comprehensive prediction. This study conducts extensive experiments on flow datasets (PeMS03/04/07/08) and speed dataset (PeMS-Bay), covering multiple prediction horizons. The results show that STEI-PCN demonstrates competitive computational efficiency in both training and inference speeds, and achieves superior or slightly inferior to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on most evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characteristic function-based tests for spatial randomness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07946v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new type of test for complete spatial randomness that applies to mapped point patterns in a rectangle or a cube of any dimension. This is the first test of its kind to be based on characteristic functions and utilizes a weighted L2-distance between the empirical and uniform characteristic functions. It is simple to calculate and does not require adjusting for edge effects. An efficient algorithm is developed to find the asymptotic null distribution of the test statistic under the Cauchy weight function. In a simulation, our test shows varying sensitivity to different levels of spatial interaction depending on the scale parameter of the Cauchy weight function. Tests with different parameter values can be combined to create a Bonferroni-corrected omnibus test, which is almost always more powerful than the popular L-test and the Clark-Evans test for detecting heterogeneous and aggregated alternatives, although less powerful than the L-test for detecting regular alternatives. The simplicity of empirical characteristic function makes it straightforward to extend our test to non-rectangular or sparsely sampled point patterns.</p></details> | 24 pages, 4 figures |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-stage Estimators for Spatial Confounding with Point-Referenced Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09358v3)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Public health data are often spatially dependent, but standard spatial regression methods can suffer from bias and invalid inference when the independent variable is associated with spatially-correlated residuals. This could occur if, for example, there is an unmeasured environmental contaminant associated with the independent and outcome variables in a spatial regression analysis. Geoadditive structural equation modeling (gSEM), in which an estimated spatial trend is removed from both the explanatory and response variables before estimating the parameters of interest, has previously been proposed as a solution, but there has been little investigation of gSEM's properties with point-referenced data. We link gSEM to results on double machine learning and semiparametric regression based on two-stage procedures. We propose using these semiparametric estimators for spatial regression using Gaussian processes with Mat\`ern covariance to estimate the spatial trends, and term this class of estimators Double Spatial Regression (DSR). We derive regularity conditions for root-$n$ asymptotic normality and consistency and closed-form variance estimation, and show that in simulations where standard spatial regression estimators are highly biased and have poor coverage, DSR can mitigate bias more effectively than competitors and obtain nominal coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[A spatial hypergraph model to smoothly interpolate between pairwise graphs and hypergraphs to study higher-order structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12688v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a spatial graph and hypergraph model that smoothly interpolates between a graph with purely pairwise edges and a graph where all connections are in large hyperedges. The key component is a spatial clustering resolution parameter that varies between assigning all the vertices in a spatial region to individual clusters, resulting in the pairwise case, to assigning all the vertices in a spatial region to a single cluster, which results in the large hyperedge case. An important outcome of this model is that the spatial structure is invariant to the choice of hyperedges. Consequently, this model enables us to study clustering coefficients, graph diffusion, and epidemic spread and how their behavior changes as a function of the higher-order structure in the network with a fixed spatial substrate. We hope that our model will find future uses to distill or explain other behaviors in higher-order networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 17 figures, preprint for PloS One Submission.

| **[SVG-IR: Spatially-Varying Gaussian Splatting for Inverse Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06815v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing 3D assets from images, known as inverse rendering (IR), remains a challenging task due to its ill-posed nature. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities for novel view synthesis (NVS) tasks. Methods apply it to relighting by separating radiance into BRDF parameters and lighting, yet produce inferior relighting quality with artifacts and unnatural indirect illumination due to the limited capability of each Gaussian, which has constant material parameters and normal, alongside the absence of physical constraints for indirect lighting. In this paper, we present a novel framework called Spatially-vayring Gaussian Inverse Rendering (SVG-IR), aimed at enhancing both NVS and relighting quality. To this end, we propose a new representation-Spatially-varying Gaussian (SVG)-that allows per-Gaussian spatially varying parameters. This enhanced representation is complemented by a SVG splatting scheme akin to vertex/fragment shading in traditional graphics pipelines. Furthermore, we integrate a physically-based indirect lighting model, enabling more realistic relighting. The proposed SVG-IR framework significantly improves rendering quality, outperforming state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods by 2.5 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and surpassing existing Gaussian-based techniques by 3.5 dB in relighting tasks, all while maintaining a real-time rendering speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Show and Tell: Visually Explainable Deep Neural Nets via Spatially-Aware Concept Bottleneck Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20134v3)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern deep neural networks have now reached human-level performance across a variety of tasks. However, unlike humans they lack the ability to explain their decisions by showing where and telling what concepts guided them. In this work, we present a unified framework for transforming any vision neural network into a spatially and conceptually interpretable model. We introduce a spatially-aware concept bottleneck layer that projects "black-box" features of pre-trained backbone models into interpretable concept maps, without requiring human labels. By training a classification layer over this bottleneck, we obtain a self-explaining model that articulates which concepts most influenced its prediction, along with heatmaps that ground them in the input image. Accordingly, we name this method "Spatially-Aware and Label-Free Concept Bottleneck Model" (SALF-CBM). Our results show that the proposed SALF-CBM: (1) Outperforms non-spatial CBM methods, as well as the original backbone, on a variety of classification tasks; (2) Produces high-quality spatial explanations, outperforming widely used heatmap-based methods on a zero-shot segmentation task; (3) Facilitates model exploration and debugging, enabling users to query specific image regions and refine the model's decisions by locally editing its concept maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Endowing Embodied Agents with Spatial Reasoning Capabilities for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08806v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the spatial perception capabilities of mobile robots is crucial for achieving embodied Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). Although significant progress has been made in simulated environments, directly transferring these capabilities to real-world scenarios often results in severe hallucination phenomena, causing robots to lose effective spatial awareness. To address this issue, we propose BrainNav, a bio-inspired spatial cognitive navigation framework inspired by biological spatial cognition theories and cognitive map theory. BrainNav integrates dual-map (coordinate map and topological map) and dual-orientation (relative orientation and absolute orientation) strategies, enabling real-time navigation through dynamic scene capture and path planning. Its five core modules-Hippocampal Memory Hub, Visual Cortex Perception Engine, Parietal Spatial Constructor, Prefrontal Decision Center, and Cerebellar Motion Execution Unit-mimic biological cognitive functions to reduce spatial hallucinations and enhance adaptability. Validated in a zero-shot real-world lab environment using the Limo Pro robot, BrainNav, compatible with GPT-4, outperforms existing State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) methods without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[STaR: Seamless Spatial-Temporal Aware Motion Retargeting with Penetration and Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06504v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion retargeting seeks to faithfully replicate the spatio-temporal motion characteristics of a source character onto a target character with a different body shape. Apart from motion semantics preservation, ensuring geometric plausibility and maintaining temporal consistency are also crucial for effective motion retargeting. However, many existing methods prioritize either geometric plausibility or temporal consistency. Neglecting geometric plausibility results in interpenetration while neglecting temporal consistency leads to motion jitter. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model for seamless Spatial-Temporal aware motion Retargeting (STaR), with penetration and consistency constraints. STaR consists of two modules: (1) a spatial module that incorporates dense shape representation and a novel limb penetration constraint to ensure geometric plausibility while preserving motion semantics, and (2) a temporal module that utilizes a temporal transformer and a novel temporal consistency constraint to predict the entire motion sequence at once while enforcing multi-level trajectory smoothness. The seamless combination of the two modules helps us achieve a good balance between the semantic, geometric, and temporal targets. Extensive experiments on the Mixamo and ScanRet datasets demonstrate that our method produces plausible and coherent motions while significantly reducing interpenetration rates compared with other approaches.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures; |

A majority of these methods are characterised by an unknown distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis of isotropy. Parametric approaches to approximating the distribution involve simulation of patterns from a user-specified isotropic model. Alternatively, nonparametric replicates of the test statistic under isotropy can be used to waive the need for specifying a model. In this paper, we first present a general framework which allows for the integration of a selected nonparametric replication method into isotropy testing. We then conduct a large simulation study comprising application-like scenarios to assess the performance of tests with different parametric and nonparametric replication methods. In particular, we explore distortions in test size and power caused by model misspecification, and demonstrate the advantages of nonparametric replication in such scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Traditional methods often focus only on the overall passenger volume, neglecting the interdependence between different modes within the hub. To address this limitation, we propose MM-STFlowNet, a comprehensive multi-mode prediction framework grounded in dynamic spatial-temporal graph modeling. Initially, an integrated temporal feature processing strategy is implemented using signal decomposition and convolution techniques to address data spikes and high volatility. Subsequently, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (STDGCRN) to capture detailed spatial-temporal dependencies across multiple traffic modes, enhanced by an adaptive channel attention mechanism. Finally, the self-attention mechanism is applied to incorporate various external factors, further enhancing prediction accuracy. Experiments on a real-world dataset from Guangzhounan Railway Station in China demonstrate that MM-STFlowNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly during peak periods, providing valuable insight for transportation hub management.</p></details> |  |

A Survey of Spatial Reasoning in LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05786v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D spatial understanding is essential in real-world applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, and medical imaging. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs), having demonstrated remarkable success across various domains, have been leveraged to enhance 3D understanding tasks, showing potential to surpass traditional computer vision methods. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of methods integrating LLMs with 3D spatial understanding. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into three branches: image-based methods deriving 3D understanding from 2D visual data, point cloud-based methods working directly with 3D representations, and hybrid modality-based methods combining multiple data streams. We systematically review representative methods along these categories, covering data representations, architectural modifications, and training strategies that bridge textual and 3D modalities. Finally, we discuss current limitations, including dataset scarcity and computational challenges, while highlighting promising research directions in spatial perception, multi-modal fusion, and real-world applications.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Security Risks in Vision-Based Beam Prediction: From Spatial Proxy Attacks to Feature Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05222v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution towards the sixth-generation (6G) networks demands advanced beamforming techniques to address challenges in dynamic, high-mobility scenarios, such as vehicular communications. Vision-based beam prediction utilizing RGB camera images emerges as a promising solution for accurate and responsive beam selection. However, reliance on visual data introduces unique vulnerabilities, particularly susceptibility to adversarial attacks, thus potentially compromising beam accuracy and overall network reliability. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic exploration of adversarial threats specifically targeting vision-based mmWave beam selection systems. Traditional white-box attacks are impractical in this context because ground-truth beam indices are inaccessible and spatial dynamics are complex. To address this, we propose a novel black-box adversarial attack strategy, termed Spatial Proxy Attack (SPA), which leverages spatial correlations between user positions and beam indices to craft effective perturbations without requiring access to model parameters or labels. To counteract these adversarial vulnerabilities, we formulate an optimization framework aimed at simultaneously enhancing beam selection accuracy under clean conditions and robustness against adversarial perturbations. We introduce a hybrid deep learning architecture integrated with a dedicated Feature Refinement Module (FRM), designed to systematically filter irrelevant, noisy and adversarially perturbed visual features. Evaluations using standard backbone models such as ResNet-50 and MobileNetV2 demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves performance, achieving up to an +21.07\% gain in Top-K accuracy under clean conditions and a 41.31\% increase in Top-1 adversarial robustness compared to different baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ABCDWaveNet: Advancing Robust Road Ponding Detection in Fog through Dynamic Frequency-Spatial Synergy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05112v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road ponding presents a significant threat to vehicle safety, particularly in adverse fog conditions, where reliable detection remains a persistent challenge for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). To address this, we propose ABCDWaveNet, a novel deep learning framework leveraging Dynamic Frequency-Spatial Synergy for robust ponding detection in fog. The core of ABCDWaveNet achieves this synergy by integrating dynamic convolution for adaptive feature extraction across varying visibilities with a wavelet-based module for synergistic frequency-spatial feature enhancement, significantly improving robustness against fog interference. Building on this foundation, ABCDWaveNet captures multi-scale structural and contextual information, subsequently employing an Adaptive Attention Coupling Gate (AACG) to adaptively fuse global and local features for enhanced accuracy. To facilitate realistic evaluations under combined adverse conditions, we introduce the Foggy Low-Light Puddle dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ABCDWaveNet establishes new state-of-the-art performance, achieving significant Intersection over Union (IoU) gains of 3.51%, 1.75%, and 1.03% on the Foggy-Puddle, Puddle-1000, and our Foggy Low-Light Puddle datasets, respectively. Furthermore, its processing speed of 25.48 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin confirms its suitability for ADAS deployment. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed Dynamic Frequency-Spatial Synergy within ABCDWaveNet, offering valuable insights for developing proactive road safety solutions capable of operating reliably in challenging weather conditions.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches primarily rely on RGB images for environmental representation, underutilizing latent textual semantic and spatial cues and leaving the modality gap between instructions and scarce environmental representations unresolved. Intuitively, humans inherently ground semantic knowledge within spatial layouts during indoor navigation. Inspired by this, we propose a versatile Semantic Understanding and Spatial Awareness (SUSA) architecture to encourage agents to ground environment from diverse perspectives. SUSA includes a Textual Semantic Understanding (TSU) module, which narrows the modality gap between instructions and environments by generating and associating the descriptions of environmental landmarks in agent's immediate surroundings. Additionally, a Depth-enhanced Spatial Perception (DSP) module incrementally constructs a depth exploration map, enabling a more nuanced comprehension of environmental layouts. Experiments demonstrate that SUSA's hybrid semantic-spatial representations effectively enhance navigation performance, setting new state-of-the-art performance across three VLN benchmarks (REVERIE, R2R, and SOON).

In this paper, we propose a robust video object segmentation framework that learns spatial-semantic features and discriminative object queries to address the above issues. Specifically, we construct a spatial-semantic block comprising a semantic embedding component and a spatial dependency modeling part for associating global semantic features and local spatial features, providing a comprehensive target representation. In addition, we develop a masked cross-attention module to generate object queries that focus on the most discriminative parts of target objects during query propagation, alleviating noise accumulation to ensure effective long-term query propagation. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark data sets, including the DAVIS2017 test (\textbf{87.8\%}), YoutubeVOS 2019 (\textbf{88.1\%}), MOSE val (\textbf{74.0\%}), and LVOS test (\textbf{73.0\%}), and demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capacity of our model.

However, their spatial understanding and reasoning-key capabilities for autonomous driving-still exhibit significant limitations. Notably, none of the existing benchmarks systematically evaluate VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities in driving scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose NuScenes-SpatialQA, the first large-scale ground-truth-based Question-Answer (QA) benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities of VLMs in autonomous driving. Built upon the NuScenes dataset, the benchmark is constructed through an automated 3D scene graph generation pipeline and a QA generation pipeline. The benchmark systematically evaluates VLMs' performance in both spatial understanding and reasoning across multiple dimensions. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse VLMs, including both general and spatial-enhanced models, providing the first comprehensive evaluation of their spatial capabilities in autonomous driving. Surprisingly, the experimental results show that the spatial-enhanced VLM outperforms in qualitative QA but does not demonstrate competitiveness in quantitative QA. In general, VLMs still face considerable challenges in spatial understanding and reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Early and accurate diagnosis of ADHD is critical for effective intervention and management. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have emerged as a non-invasive and efficient tool for ADHD detection due to their high temporal resolution and ability to capture neural dynamics. In this study, we propose a method for classifying ADHD and healthy children using EEG data from the benchmark dataset. There were 61 children with ADHD and 60 healthy children, both boys and girls, aged 7 to 12. The EEG signals, recorded from 19 channels, were processed to extract Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Spectral Entropy (SE) features across five frequency bands, resulting in a comprehensive 190-dimensional feature set. To evaluate the classification performance, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the RBF kernel demonstrated the best performance with a mean cross-validation accuracy of 99.2\% and a standard deviation of 0.0079, indicating high robustness and precision. These results highlight the potential of spatial features in conjunction with machine learning for accurately classifying ADHD using EEG data. This work contributes to developing non-invasive, data-driven tools for early diagnosis and assessment of ADHD in children.</p></details> |  |

These models excel not only in creating fixed-size images but also in producing panoramic images. However, existing methods often struggle with spatial layout consistency when producing high-resolution panoramas due to the lack of guidance on the global image layout. This paper introduces the Multi-Scale Diffusion (MSD), an optimized framework that extends the panoramic image generation framework to multiple resolution levels. Our method leverages gradient descent techniques to incorporate structural information from low-resolution images into high-resolution outputs. Through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations against prior work, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the coherence of high-resolution panorama generation.</p></details> |  |

Despite some promising results, the role of point clouds in 3D spatial reasoning remains under-explored. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate and analyze these models to answer the research question: \textit{Does point cloud truly boost the spatial reasoning capacities of 3D LLMs?} We first evaluate the spatial reasoning capacity of LLMs with different input modalities by replacing the point cloud with the visual and text counterparts. We then propose a novel 3D QA (Question-answering) benchmark, ScanReQA, that comprehensively evaluates models' understanding of binary spatial relationships. Our findings reveal several critical insights: 1) LLMs without point input could even achieve competitive performance even in a zero-shot manner; 2) existing 3D LLMs struggle to comprehend the binary spatial relationships; 3) 3D LLMs exhibit limitations in exploiting the structural coordinates in point clouds for fine-grained spatial reasoning. We think these conclusions can help the next step of 3D LLMs and also offer insights for foundation models in other modalities. We release datasets and reproducible codes in the anonymous project page: https://3d-llm.xyz.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Geometry Enhanced 3D Dynamic Snake Convolutional Neural Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04463v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image classification, including complex and sparse ground object distributions, small clustered structures, and elongated multi-branch features that often lead to missing detections. To better adapt to ground object distributions and achieve adaptive dynamic feature responses while skipping redundant information, this paper proposes a Spatial-Geometry Enhanced 3D Dynamic Snake Network (SG-DSCNet) based on an improved 3D-DenseNet model. The network employs Dynamic Snake Convolution (DSCConv), which introduces deformable offsets to enhance kernel flexibility through constrained self-learning, thereby improving regional perception of ground objects. Additionally, we propose a multi-view feature fusion strategy that generates multiple morphological kernel templates from DSCConv to observe target structures from different perspectives and achieve efficient feature fusion through summarizing key characteristics. This dynamic approach enables the model to focus more flexibly on critical spatial structures when processing different regions, rather than relying on fixed receptive fields of single static kernels. The DSC module enhances model representation capability through dynamic kernel aggregation without increasing network depth or width. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance on the IN, UP, and KSC datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral classification methods.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |

In modern robotics, these capabilities are increasingly provided by vision-language models. However, these models face significant challenges in spatial reasoning tasks, as their training data are based on general-purpose image datasets that often lack sophisticated spatial understanding. For example, datasets frequently do not capture reference frame comprehension, yet effective spatial reasoning requires understanding whether to reason from ego-, world-, or object-centric perspectives. To address this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale dataset for spatial understanding in robotics. It consists of real indoor and tabletop scenes, captured as 3D scans and egocentric images, and annotated with rich spatial information relevant to robotics. The dataset includes 1M images, 5k 3D scans, and 3M annotated spatial relationships, and the pairing of 2D egocentric images with 3D scans makes it both 2D- and 3D- ready. Our experiments show that models trained with RoboSpatial outperform baselines on downstream tasks such as spatial affordance prediction, spatial relationship prediction, and robot manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (Oral); Project Website: https://chanh.ee/RoboSpatial</p></details> |

Traditional models employ fixed parameters regardless of geographical context, misrepresenting how seismic effects vary across diverse landscapes, while remote sensing technologies struggle to distinguish between co-located hazards. We address these challenges with a spatially-aware causal Bayesian network that decouples co-located hazards by modeling their causal relationships with location-specific parameters. Our framework integrates sensing observations, latent variables, and spatial heterogeneity through a novel combination of Gaussian Processes with normalizing flows, enabling us to capture how same earthquake produces different effects across varied geological and topographical features. Evaluations across three earthquakes demonstrate Spatial-VCBN achieves Area Under the Curve (AUC) improvements of up to 35.2% over existing methods. These results highlight the critical importance of modeling spatial heterogeneity in causal mechanisms for accurate disaster assessment, with direct implications for improving emergency response resource allocation.</p></details> |  |

By incorporating both public and corporate environmental initiatives, the analysis highlights the direct and spatial spillover effects of sustainability measures on tourism demand. The findings indicate that corporate-led initiatives, such as ecocertifications and green investments, exert a stronger direct influence on tourism flows compared to public measures, underscoring the visibility and immediate impact of private sector actions. However, both types of initiatives generate significant positive spatial spillovers, suggesting that sustainability efforts extend beyond local boundaries. These results demonstrate the interconnected nature of regional tourism systems and emphasize the critical role of coordinated sustainability policies in fostering tourism growth while promoting environmental protection. By addressing the spatial interdependencies of tourism flows and sustainability practices, this research provides valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders seeking to improve sustainable tourism development at regional and national levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[DropMAE: Learning Representations via Masked Autoencoders with Spatial-Attention Dropout for Temporal Matching Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00571v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies masked autoencoder (MAE) video pre-training for various temporal matching-based downstream tasks, i.e., object-level tracking tasks including video object tracking (VOT) and video object segmentation (VOS), self-supervised visual correspondence learning, dense tracking tasks including optical flow estimation and long-term point tracking, and 3D point cloud tracking. Specifically, our work explores to provide a general representation to boost the temporal matching ability in various downstream tracking tasks. To achieve this, we firstly find that a simple extension of MAE, which randomly masks out frame patches in videos and reconstruct the frame pixels, heavily relies on spatial cues while ignoring temporal relations for frame reconstruction, thus leading to sub-optimal temporal matching representations. To alleviate this, we propose DropMAE, which adaptively performs spatial-attention dropout in the frame reconstruction to facilitate temporal correspondence learning in videos. We obtain several important findings with DropMAE: 1) DropMAE is a strong and efficient temporal matching learner, which achieves better fine-tuning results on matching-based tasks than the ImageNet-based MAE with 2x faster pre-training speed. 2) DropMAE is effective for different tracking tasks, i.e., object-level matching tasks including VOT and VOS, dense tracking tasks including optical flow estimation and tracking any point (TAP), and even 3D tracking in the different modality of point cloud data. Since none exists, we build ViT-based trackers for different downstream tracking tasks, and our pre-trained DropMAE model can be directly loaded in these ViT-based trackers for fine-tuning without further modifications. Experiments on 6 downstream tracking tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of DropMAE as a general pre-trained representation for diverse tracking tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extension of DropMAE for 6 temporal matching-based downstream tasks</p></details> |

Compared to previous work, our Flow MAtching Postprocessing (FMAP) better represents the correlation structures of the observations distribution, while also improving marginal performance at the stations. FMAP generates forecasts that are not bound to what is already modeled by the underlying gridded prediction and can infer new correlation structures from data. The resulting model can generate an arbitrary number of forecasts from a limited number of numerical simulations, allowing for low-cost forecasting systems. A single training is sufficient to perform postprocessing at multiple lead times, in contrast with other methods which use multiple trained networks at generation time. This work details our methodology, including a spatial attention transformer backbone trained within a flow matching generative modeling framework. FMAP shows promising performance in experiments on the EUPPBench dataset, forecasting surface temperature and wind gust values at station locations in western Europe up to five-day lead times.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Coherent Disaggregation and Uncertainty Quantification for Spatially Misaligned Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10584v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial misalignment problems arise from both data aggregation and attempts to align misaligned data, leading to information loss. We propose a Bayesian disaggregation framework that links misaligned data to a continuous domain model using an iteratively linearised integration method via integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA). The framework supports point pattern and aggregated count models under four covariate field scenarios: \textit{Raster at Full Resolution (RastFull), Raster Aggregation (RastAgg), Polygon Aggregation (PolyAgg), and Point Values (PointVal)}. The first three involve aggregation, while the latter two have incomplete fields. For PolyAgg and PointVal, we estimate the full covariate field using \textit{Value Plugin, Joint Uncertainty, and Uncertainty Plugin} methods, with the latter two accounting for uncertainty propagation. These methods demonstrate superior performance, and remain more robust even under model misspecification (i.e.\ modelling a nonlinear field as linear). In landslide studies, landslide occurrences are often aggregated into counts based on slope units, reducing spatial detail. The results indicate that point pattern observations and full-resolution covariate fields should be prioritized. For incomplete fields, methods incorporating uncertainty propagation are preferred. This framework supports landslide susceptibility and other spatial mapping, integrating seamlessly with INLA-extension packages.</p></details> | 103 pages |
| **[Electromyography-Based Gesture Recognition: Hierarchical Feature Extraction for Enhanced Spatial-Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03221v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand gesture recognition using multichannel surface electromyography (sEMG) is challenging due to unstable predictions and inefficient time-varying feature enhancement. To overcome the lack of signal based time-varying feature problems, we propose a lightweight squeeze-excitation deep learning-based multi stream spatial temporal dynamics time-varying feature extraction approach to build an effective sEMG-based hand gesture recognition system. Each branch of the proposed model was designed to extract hierarchical features, capturing both global and detailed spatial-temporal relationships to ensure feature effectiveness. The first branch, utilizing a Bidirectional-TCN (Bi-TCN), focuses on capturing long-term temporal dependencies by modelling past and future temporal contexts, providing a holistic view of gesture dynamics. The second branch, incorporating a 1D Convolutional layer, separable CNN, and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block, efficiently extracts spatial-temporal features while emphasizing critical feature channels, enhancing feature relevance. The third branch, combining a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), captures bidirectional temporal relationships and time-varying patterns. Outputs from all branches are fused using concatenation to capture subtle variations in the data and then refined with a channel attention module, selectively focusing on the most informative features while improving computational efficiency. The proposed model was tested on the Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB5 datasets, achieving accuracy rates of 96.41%, 92.40%, and 93.34%, respectively. These results demonstrate the capability of the system to handle complex sEMG dynamics, offering advancements in prosthetic limb control and human-machine interface technologies with significant implications for assistive technologies.</p></details> |  |

However, while these models can generate realistic captions, they often struggle with providing precise instructions, particularly when it comes to localizing and disambiguating objects in complex 3D environments. This capability is critical as MLLMs become more integrated with collaborative robotic systems. In scenarios where a target object is surrounded by similar objects (distractors), robots must deliver clear, spatially-aware instructions to guide humans effectively. We refer to this challenge as contextual object localization and disambiguation, which imposes stricter constraints than conventional 3D dense captioning, especially regarding ensuring target exclusivity. In response, we propose simple yet effective techniques to enhance the model's ability to localize and disambiguate target objects. Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on conventional metrics that evaluate sentence similarity, but also demonstrates improved 3D spatial understanding through 3D visual grounding model.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |
| **[Extending Data Spatial Semantics for Scale Agnostic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03109v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce extensions to Data Spatial Programming (DSP) that enable scale-agnostic programming for application development. Building on DSP's paradigm shift from data-to-compute to compute-to-data, we formalize additional intrinsic language constructs that abstract persistent state, multi-user contexts, multiple entry points, and cross-machine distribution for applications. By introducing a globally accessible root node and treating walkers as potential entry points, we demonstrate how programs can be written once and executed across scales, from single-user to multi-user, from local to distributed, without modification. These extensions allow developers to focus on domain logic while delegating runtime concerns of persistence, multi-user support, distribution, and API interfacing to the execution environment. Our approach makes scale-agnostic programming a natural extension of the topological semantics of DSP, allowing applications to seamlessly transition from single-user to multi-user scenarios, from ephemeral to persistent execution contexts, and from local to distributed execution environments.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[An Anytime Valid Test for Complete Spatial Randomness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02960v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A relevant question when analyzing spatial point patterns is that of spatial randomness. More specifically, before any model can be fit to a point pattern a first step is to test the data for departures from complete spatial randomness (CSR). Traditional techniques employ distance or quadrat counts based methods to test for CSR based on batched data. In this paper, we consider the practical scenario of testing for CSR when the data are available sequentially (i.e., online). We present a sequential testing methodology called as {\em PRe-process} that is based on e-values and is a fast, efficient and nonparametric method. Simulation experiments with the truth departing from CSR in two different scenarios show that the method is effective in capturing inhomogeneity over time. Two real data illustrations considering lung cancer cases in the Chorley-Ribble area, England from 1974 - 1983 and locations of earthquakes in the state of Oklahoma, USA from 2000 - 2011 demonstrate the utility of the PRe-process in sequential testing of CSR.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAT: Dynamic Spatial Aptitude Training for Multimodal Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07755v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning about motion and space is a fundamental cognitive capability that is required by multiple real-world applications. While many studies highlight that large multimodal language models (MLMs) struggle to reason about space, they only focus on static spatial relationships, and not dynamic awareness of motion and space, i.e., reasoning about the effect of egocentric and object motions on spatial relationships. Manually annotating such object and camera movements is expensive. Hence, we introduce SAT, a simulated spatial aptitude training dataset comprising both static and dynamic spatial reasoning across 175K question-answer (QA) pairs and 20K scenes. Complementing this, we also construct a small (150 image-QAs) yet challenging dynamic spatial test set using real-world images. Leveraging our SAT datasets and 6 existing static spatial benchmarks, we systematically investigate what improves both static and dynamic spatial awareness. Our results reveal that simulations are surprisingly effective at imparting spatial aptitude to MLMs that translate to real images. We show that perfect annotations in simulation are more effective than existing approaches of pseudo-annotating real images. For instance, SAT training improves a LLaVA-13B model by an average 11% and a LLaVA-Video-7B model by an average 8% on multiple spatial benchmarks, including our real-image dynamic test set and spatial reasoning on long videos -- even outperforming some large proprietary models. While reasoning over static relationships improves with synthetic training data, there is still considerable room for improvement for dynamic reasoning questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://arijitray.com/SAT/</p></details> |

Multiplexed imaging technologies enable high-resolution spatial characterization of the TME, yet statistical methods for analyzing multi-subject spatial tissue data remain limited. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for inferring spatial dependencies in multiplexed imaging datasets across multiple subjects. Our model represents the TME as a multivariate log-Gaussian Cox process, where spatial intensity functions of different cell types are governed by a latent multivariate Gaussian process. By pooling information across subjects, we estimate spatial correlation functions that capture within-type and cross-type dependencies, enabling interpretable inference about disease-specific cellular organization. We validate our method using simulations, demonstrating robustness to latent factor specification and spatial resolution. We apply our approach to two multiplexed imaging datasets: pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer, revealing distinct spatial organization patterns across disease subtypes and highlighting tumor-immune interactions that differentiate immune-permissive and immune-exclusive microenvironments. These findings provide insight into mechanisms of immune evasion and may inform novel therapeutic strategies. Our approach offers a principled framework for modeling spatial dependencies in multi-subject data, with broader applicability to spatially resolved omics and imaging studies. An R package, available online, implements our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Noise Calibration and Spatial-Frequency Interactive Network for STEM Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02555v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) enables the observation of atomic arrangements at sub-angstrom resolution, allowing for atomically resolved analysis of the physical and chemical properties of materials. However, due to the effects of noise, electron beam damage, sample thickness, etc, obtaining satisfactory atomic-level images is often challenging. Enhancing STEM images can reveal clearer structural details of materials. Nonetheless, existing STEM image enhancement methods usually overlook unique features in the frequency domain, and existing datasets lack realism and generality. To resolve these issues, in this paper, we develop noise calibration, data synthesis, and enhancement methods for STEM images. We first present a STEM noise calibration method, which is used to synthesize more realistic STEM images. The parameters of background noise, scan noise, and pointwise noise are obtained by statistical analysis and fitting of real STEM images containing atoms. Then we use these parameters to develop a more general dataset that considers both regular and random atomic arrangements and includes both HAADF and BF mode images. Finally, we design a spatial-frequency interactive network for STEM image enhancement, which can explore the information in the frequency domain formed by the periodicity of atomic arrangement. Experimental results show that our data is closer to real STEM images and achieves better enhancement performances together with our network.

Early studies always encounter trade-offs related to sampling rate, bandwidth, field of view, and the simplicity of the optical path. Recent advances in event camera hardware show good potential for its application in visual sound recovery, because of its superior ability in capturing high-frequency signals. However, existing event-based vibration recovery methods are still sub-optimal for sound recovery. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline for non-contact sound recovery, fully utilizing spatial-temporal information from the event stream. We first generate a large training set using a novel simulation pipeline. Then we designed a network that leverages the sparsity of events to capture spatial information and uses Mamba to model long-term temporal information. Lastly, we train a spatial aggregation block to aggregate information from different locations to further improve signal quality. To capture event signals caused by sound waves, we also designed an imaging system using a laser matrix to enhance the gradient and collected multiple data sequences for testing. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project page: https://yyzq1.github.io/EvMic/</p></details> |

Recent approaches have introduced Region-Language Alignment (RLA) to enhance CLIP's performance in dense multimodal tasks by aligning regional visual representations with corresponding text inputs. However, we find that CLIP ViTs fine-tuned with RLA suffer from notable loss in spatial awareness, which is crucial for dense prediction tasks. To address this, we propose the Spatial Correlation Distillation (SCD) framework, which preserves CLIP's inherent spatial structure and mitigates the above degradation. To further enhance spatial correlations, we introduce a lightweight Refiner that extracts refined correlations directly from CLIP before feeding them into SCD, based on an intriguing finding that CLIP naturally captures high-quality dense features. Together, these components form a robust distillation framework that enables CLIP ViTs to integrate both visual-language and visual-centric improvements, achieving state-of-the-art results across various open-vocabulary dense prediction benchmarks.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Using this finding, we derive a discrete stochastic maximal \(L^p\)-regularity estimate for a spatial semidiscretization. Furthermore, we provide a nearly optimal pathwise uniform convergence estimate for this spatial semidiscretization under a wide range of spatial \(L^q\)-norms.</p></details> |  |

We describe toric codes as quantum counterparts of classical two-dimensional spatially-coupled (2D-SC) codes, and introduce spatially-coupled quantum LDPC (SC-QLDPC) codes as a generalization. We use the convolutional structure to represent the parity check matrix of a 2D-SC code as a polynomial in two indeterminates, and derive an algebraic condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a 2D-SC code to be a stabilizer code. This algebraic framework facilitates the construction of new code families. While not the focus of this paper, we note that small memory facilitates physical connectivity of qubits, and it enables local encoding and low-latency windowed decoding. In this paper, we use the algebraic framework to optimize short cycles in the Tanner graph of 2D-SC hypergraph product (HGP) codes that arise from short cycles in either component code. While prior work focuses on QLDPC codes with rate less than 1/10, we construct 2D-SC HGP codes with small memories, higher rates (about 1/3), and superior thresholds.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 10 figures.

The proposed approach explicitly accounts for additive manufacturing uncertainties by modeling material porosity as a spatially correlated stochastic field within a multiphase finite element formulation. A risk-averse objective function, incorporating statistical moments of the design objective, is employed in conjunction with chance constraints that enforce mechanical stability by restricting the probability of exceeding critical stress thresholds. To mitigate the prohibitively high computational cost associated with the large-dimensional uncertainty space and Monte Carlo estimations of the objective function's statistical moments, a second-order Taylor expansion is utilized as a control variate. Furthermore, a continuation-based smoothing strategy is introduced to address the non-differentiability of the chance constraints, ensuring compatibility with gradient-based optimization. The resulting framework achieves computational scalability, remaining agnostic to the dimensionality of the stochastic design space. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on two- and three-dimensional thermal break systems for building insulation. The results highlight the framework's capability to solve large-scale, chance-constrained optimal design problems governed by finite element models with uncertain design parameter spaces reaching dimensions in the hundreds of thousands.</p></details> |  |

While previous studies have evaluated the robustness of semantic segmentation (SS) models under whole-image natural or adversarial corruptions, a comprehensive investigation into the spatial robustness of dense vision models under localized corruptions remained underexplored. This paper fills this gap by introducing specialized metrics for benchmarking the spatial robustness of segmentation models, alongside with an evaluation framework to assess the impact of localized corruptions. Furthermore, we uncover the inherent complexity of characterizing worst-case robustness using a single localized adversarial perturbation. To address this, we propose region-aware multi-attack adversarial analysis, a method that enables a deeper understanding of model robustness against adversarial perturbations applied to specific regions. The proposed metrics and analysis were evaluated on 15 segmentation models in driving scenarios, uncovering key insights into the effects of localized corruption in both natural and adversarial forms. The results reveal that models respond to these two types of threats differently; for instance, transformer-based segmentation models demonstrate notable robustness to localized natural corruptions but are highly vulnerable to adversarial ones and vice-versa for CNN-based models. Consequently, we also address the challenge of balancing robustness to both natural and adversarial localized corruptions by means of ensemble models, thereby achieving a broader threat coverage and improved reliability for dense vision tasks.</p></details> | Under review |

However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, similar to most RGBT fusion tasks, it still mainly relies on manually aligned multimodal image pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Multimodal Spatio-temporal Graph learning Network (MSGNet) for alignment-free RGBT VOD problem by leveraging the robust graph representation learning model. Specifically, we first design an Adaptive Partitioning Layer (APL) to estimate the corresponding regions of the Thermal image within the RGB image (high-resolution), achieving a preliminary inexact alignment. Then, we introduce the Spatial Sparse Graph Learning Module (S-SGLM) which employs a sparse information passing mechanism on the estimated inexact alignment to achieve reliable information interaction between different modalities. Moreover, to fully exploit the temporal cues for RGBT VOD problem, we introduce Hybrid Structured Temporal Modeling (HSTM), which involves a Temporal Sparse Graph Learning Module (T-SGLM) and Temporal Star Block (TSB). T-SGLM aims to filter out some redundant information between adjacent frames by employing the sparse aggregation mechanism on the temporal graph. Meanwhile, TSB is dedicated to achieving the complementary learning of local spatial relationships. Extensive comparative experiments conducted on both the aligned dataset VT-VOD50 and the unaligned dataset UVT-VOD2024 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

An effective load consolidation plan relies on carefully chosen consolidation points to ensure alignment with existing transportation management processes, such as driver scheduling, personnel planning, and terminal operations. This complexity represents a significant challenge when searching for optimal consolidation strategies. Traditional optimization-based methods provide exact solutions, but their computational complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances and they fail to leverage historical data. Machine learning-based approaches address these issues but often ignore operational constraints, leading to infeasible consolidation plans. This work proposes SPOT, an end-to-end approach that integrates the benefits of machine learning (ML) and optimization for load consolidation. The ML component plays a key role in the planning phase by identifying the consolidation points through spatio-temporal clustering and constrained frequent itemset mining, while the optimization selects the most cost-effective feasible consolidation routes for a given operational day. Extensive experiments conducted on industrial load data demonstrate that SPOT significantly reduces travel distance and transportation costs (by about 50% on large terminals) compared to the existing industry-standard load planning strategy and a neighborhood-based heuristic.

However, existing 3D segmentation models solely focus on spatial information. To address this gap, we propose OmniMamba4D, a novel segmentation model designed for 4D medical images (3D images over time). OmniMamba4D utilizes a spatio-temporal tetra-orientated Mamba block to effectively capture both spatial and temporal features. Unlike traditional 3D models, which analyze single-time points, OmniMamba4D processes 4D CT data, providing comprehensive spatio-temporal information on lesion progression. Evaluated on an internal dataset comprising of 3,252 CT scans, OmniMamba4D achieves a competitive Dice score of 0.682, comparable to state-of-the-arts (SOTA) models, while maintaining computational efficiency and better detecting disappeared lesions. This work demonstrates a new framework to leverage spatio-temporal information for longitudinal CT lesion segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2025</p></details> |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Joint Conference on Neural Networks(IJCNN), 2015</p></details> |

The key challenge of accurate prediction is how to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and adapt to the inherent dynamics in data. Traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) often struggle with static adjacency matrices that introduce domain bias or learnable matrices that may be overfitting to specific patterns. This challenge becomes more complex when considering Multi-Task Learning (MTL). While MTL has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy through task synergies, it can also face significant hurdles due to task interference. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a novel MTL framework, Dynamic Group-wise Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task Learning (DG-STMTL). DG-STMTL proposes a hybrid adjacency matrix generation module that combines static matrices with dynamic ones through a task-specific gating mechanism. We also introduce a group-wise GCN module to enhance the modelling capability of spatio-temporal dependencies. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate our method. Results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-arts, indicating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and model will be released at https://github.com/Jayce1kk/SpaceVLLM.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> |  |

Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |

Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.</p></details> | 6 pages |

We would like to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. Thus, we propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address these challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance (in terms of an f-divergence) between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.09482</p></details> |
| **[Towards Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control through Spatio-temporal Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11014v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are integral to intelligent traffic management, fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatio-temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent urban traffic management solutions.

Decoding covert speech from electroencephalogram (EEG) is challenging due to a limited understanding of neural pronunciation mapping and the low signal-to-noise ratio of the signal. In this study, we developed a large-scale multi-utterance speech EEG dataset from 57 right-handed native English-speaking subjects, each performing covert and overt speech tasks by repeating the same word in five utterances within a ten-second duration. Given the spatio-temporal nature of the neural activation process during speech pronunciation, we developed a Functional Areas Spatio-temporal Transformer (FAST), an effective framework for converting EEG signals into tokens and utilizing transformer architecture for sequence encoding. Our results reveal distinct and interpretable speech neural features by the visualization of FAST-generated activation maps across frontal and temporal brain regions with each word being covertly spoken, providing new insights into the discriminative features of the neural representation of covert speech. This is the first report of such a study, which provides interpretable evidence for speech decoding from EEG.

| **[DRAN: A Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network for Spatio-temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01531v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems' states are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. To address non-stationarity frameworks, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, we develop a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module that enables the normalization and de-normalization process in spatio-temporal systems. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state of the art methods in weather prediction and traffic flows forecasting tasks. Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes. Moreover, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

However, the inherently sparse and non-deterministic nature of radar data limits the effectiveness of traditional single-frame BEV paradigms. In this paper, we addresses this limitation by introducing AttentiveGRU, a novel attention-based recurrent approach tailored for radar constraints, which extracts individualized spatio-temporal context for objects by dynamically identifying and fusing temporally correlated structures across present and memory states. By leveraging the consistency of object's latent representation over time, our approach exploits temporal relations to enrich feature representations for both stationary and moving objects, thereby enhancing detection performance and eliminating the need for externally providing or estimating any information about ego vehicle motion. Our experimental results on the public nuScenes dataset show a significant increase in mAP for the car category by 21% over the best radar-only submission. Further evaluations on an additional dataset demonstrate notable improvements in object detection capabilities, underscoring the applicability and effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, SNN possess a crucial characteristic, namely the ability to process spatio-temporal information. However, this ability is constrained by both internal and external factors in practical applications, thereby affecting the performance of SNN. Firstly, the internal issue of SNN lies in the inherent limitations of their network structure and neuronal model, which result in the network adopting a unified processing approach for information of different temporal dimensions when processing input data containing complex temporal information. Secondly, the external issue of SNN stems from the direct encoding method commonly adopted by directly trained SNN, which uses the same feature map for input at each time step, failing to fully exploit the spatio-temporal characteristics of SNN. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Unconstrained Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ULIF) neuronal model that allows for learning different membrane potential parameters at different time steps, thereby enhancing SNN' ability to process information of different temporal dimensions. Additionally, this paper presents a hybrid encoding scheme aimed at solving the problem of direct encoding lacking temporal dimension information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively improve the overall performance of SNN in object detection and object recognition tasks. related code is available at https://github.com/hhx0320/ASNN.</p></details> |  |

Despite its success, existing Mamba-based vision models have overlooked the nuances of event-driven tasks, especially in video reconstruction. Event-based video reconstruction (EBVR) demands spatial translation invariance and close attention to local event relationships in the spatio-temporal domain. Unfortunately, conventional Mamba algorithms apply static window partitions and standard reshape scanning methods, leading to significant losses in local connectivity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EventMamba--a specialized model designed for EBVR tasks. EventMamba innovates by incorporating random window offset (RWO) in the spatial domain, moving away from the restrictive fixed partitioning. Additionally, it features a new consistent traversal serialization approach in the spatio-temporal domain, which maintains the proximity of adjacent events both spatially and temporally. These enhancements enable EventMamba to retain Mamba's robust modeling capabilities while significantly preserving the spatio-temporal locality of event data. Comprehensive testing on multiple datasets shows that EventMamba markedly enhances video reconstruction, drastically improving computation speed while delivering superior visual quality compared to Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability.

The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.</p></details> |  |

To ensure optimal synchronization, we introduce a fine-grained spatio-temporal alignment mechanism through a Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Synchronized Prior (HiST-Sypo) Estimator.

However, existing multi-sensor fusion research predominantly integrates complementary context from multiple images rather than videos. This primarily stems from two factors: 1) the scarcity of large-scale multi-sensor video datasets, limiting research in video fusion, and 2) the inherent difficulty of jointly modeling spatial and temporal dependencies in a unified framework. This paper proactively compensates for the dilemmas. First, we construct M3SVD, a benchmark dataset with $220$ temporally synchronized and spatially registered infrared-visible video pairs comprising 153,797 frames, filling the data gap for the video fusion community. Secondly, we propose VideoFusion, a multi-modal video fusion model that fully exploits cross-modal complementarity and temporal dynamics to generate spatio-temporally coherent videos from (potentially degraded) multi-modal inputs. Specifically, 1) a differential reinforcement module is developed for cross-modal information interaction and enhancement, 2) a complete modality-guided fusion strategy is employed to adaptively integrate multi-modal features, and 3) a bi-temporal co-attention mechanism is devised to dynamically aggregate forward-backward temporal contexts to reinforce cross-frame feature representations. Extensive experiments reveal that VideoFusion outperforms existing image-oriented fusion paradigms in sequential scenarios, effectively mitigating temporal inconsistency and interference.</p></details> |  |

VT migration is an effective way that migrates the VT when the locations of physical entities keep changing to maintain seamless immersive VT services. However, an efficient VT migration is challenging due to the rapid movement of vehicles, dynamic workloads of Roadside Units (RSUs), and heterogeneous resources of the RSUs. To achieve efficient migration decisions and a minimum latency for the VT migration, we propose a multi-agent split Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework combined with spatio-temporal trajectory generation. In this framework, multiple split DRL agents utilize split architecture to efficiently determine VT migration decisions. Furthermore, we propose a spatio-temporal trajectory generation algorithm based on trajectory datasets and road network data to simulate vehicle trajectories, enhancing the generalization of the proposed scheme for managing VT migration in dynamic network environments. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only enhances the Quality of Experience (QoE) by 29% but also reduces the computational parameter count by approximately 25% while maintaining similar performances, enhancing users' immersive experiences in vehicular metaverses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Crop Yields Forecasts With Spatio-Temporal Conditional Copula Using Extreme Weather Covariates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22807v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel forecasting model for crop yields that explicitly accounts for spatio-temporal dependence and the influence of extreme weather and climatic events. Our approach combines Bayesian Structural Time Series for modeling marginal crop yields, ensuring a more robust quantification of uncertainty given the typically short historical records. To capture dynamic dependencies between regions, we develop a time-varying conditional copula model, where the copula parameter evolves over time as a function of its previous lag and extreme weather covariates. Unlike traditional approaches that treat climatic factors as fixed inputs, we incorporate dynamic Generalized Extreme Value models to characterize extreme weather events, enabling a more accurate reflection of their impact on crop yields. Furthermore, to ensure scalability for large-scale applications, we build on the existing Partitioning Around Medoids clustering algorithm and introduce a novel dissimilarity measure that integrates both spatial and copula-based dependence, enabling an effective reduction of the dimensionality in the dependence structure.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches face a trilemma: diffusion-based methods achieve high visual fidelity but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while GAN-based solutions sacrifice lip-sync accuracy or dental details for real-time performance. We present MuseTalk, a novel two-stage training framework that resolves this trade-off through latent space optimization and spatio-temporal data sampling strategy. Our key innovations include: (1) During the Facial Abstract Pretraining stage, we propose Informative Frame Sampling to temporally align reference-source pose pairs, eliminating redundant feature interference while preserving identity cues. (2) In the Lip-Sync Adversarial Finetuning stage, we employ Dynamic Margin Sampling to spatially select the most suitable lip-movement-promoting regions, balancing audio-visual synchronization and dental clarity. (3) MuseTalk establishes an effective audio-visual feature fusion framework in the latent space, delivering 30 FPS output at 256*256 resolution on an NVIDIA V100 GPU. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MuseTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity while achieving comparable lip-sync accuracy. %The codes and models will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Recent advances have improved the spatial reasoning ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing large-scale data, but these models still struggle to analyze kinematic elements like traveled distance and speed of moving objects. To bridge this gap, we construct a spatio-temporal reasoning dataset and benchmark involving kinematic instruction tuning, referred to as STKit and STKit-Bench. They consist of real-world videos with 3D annotations, detailing object motion dynamics: traveled distance, speed, movement direction, inter-object distance comparisons, and relative movement direction. To further scale such data construction to videos without 3D labels, we propose an automatic pipeline to generate pseudo-labels using 4D reconstruction in real-world scale. With our kinematic instruction tuning data for spatio-temporal reasoning, we present ST-VLM, a VLM enhanced for spatio-temporal reasoning, which exhibits outstanding performance on STKit-Bench. Furthermore, we show that ST-VLM generalizes robustly across diverse domains and tasks, outperforming baselines on other spatio-temporal benchmarks (eg, ActivityNet, TVQA+). Finally, by integrating learned spatio-temporal reasoning with existing abilities, ST-VLM enables complex multi-step reasoning. Project page: https://ikodoh.github.io/ST-VLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unbiased and Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Anticipation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13059v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Scene Graphs (STSGs) provide a concise and expressive representation of dynamic scenes by modeling objects and their evolving relationships over time. However, real-world visual relationships often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, causing existing methods for tasks like Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) and Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) to produce biased scene graphs. To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages loss masking and curriculum learning to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Unlike prior methods that add extra architectural components to learn unbiased estimators, we propose an impartial training objective that reduces the dominance of head classes during learning and focuses on underrepresented tail relationships. Our curriculum-driven mask generation strategy further empowers the model to adaptively adjust its bias mitigation strategy over time, enabling more balanced and robust estimations. To thoroughly assess performance under various distribution shifts, we also introduce two new tasks Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation offering a challenging benchmark for evaluating the resilience of STSG models. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate the superior unbiased performance and robustness of our method compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Compared to its predecessor SV4D, SV4D 2.0 is more robust to occlusions and large motion, generalizes better to real-world videos, and produces higher-quality outputs in terms of detail sharpness and spatio-temporal consistency. We achieve this by introducing key improvements in multiple aspects: 1) network architecture: eliminating the dependency of reference multi-views and designing blending mechanism for 3D and frame attention, 2) data: enhancing quality and quantity of training data, 3) training strategy: adopting progressive 3D-4D training for better generalization, and 4) 4D optimization: handling 3D inconsistency and large motion via 2-stage refinement and progressive frame sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance gain by SV4D 2.0 both visually and quantitatively, achieving better detail (-14\% LPIPS) and 4D consistency (-44\% FV4D) in novel-view video synthesis and 4D optimization (-12\% LPIPS and -24\% FV4D) compared to SV4D.

However, relation modeling between different image patches exhibits significant variations. For instance, background regions dominated by target-irrelevant information require reduced attention allocation, while foreground, particularly boundary areas, need to be be emphasized. A single model may not effectively handle all kinds of relation modeling simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel tracker called SPMTrack based on mixture-of-experts tailored for visual tracking task (TMoE), combining the capability of multiple experts to handle diverse relation modeling more flexibly. Benefiting from TMoE, we extend relation modeling from image pairs to spatio-temporal context, further improving tracking accuracy with minimal increase in model parameters. Moreover, we employ TMoE as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, substantially reducing trainable parameters, which enables us to train SPMTrack of varying scales efficiently and preserve the generalization ability of pretrained models to achieve superior performance. We conduct experiments on seven datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers.

Despite its importance, conventional LVEF estimation remains time-consuming and operator-dependent. Recent deep learning advancements have enhanced automation, yet many existing models are computationally demanding, hindering their feasibility for real-time clinical applications. Additionally, the interplay between spatial and temporal features is crucial for accurate estimation but is often overlooked. In this work, we propose Echo-E$^3$Net, an efficient Endo-Epi spatio-temporal network tailored for LVEF estimation. Our method introduces the Endo-Epi Cardial Border Detector (E$^2$CBD) module, which enhances feature extraction by leveraging spatial and temporal landmark cues. Complementing this, the Endo-Epi Feature Aggregator (E$^2$FA) distills statistical descriptors from backbone feature maps, refining the final EF prediction. These modules, along with a multi-component loss function tailored to align with the clinical definition of EF, collectively enhance spatial-temporal representation learning, ensuring robust and efficient EF estimation. We evaluate Echo-E$^3$Net on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, achieving a RMSE of 5.15 and an R$^2$ score of 0.82, setting a new benchmark in efficiency with 6.8 million parameters and only 8.49G Flops. Our model operates without pre-training, data augmentation, or ensemble methods, making it well-suited for real-time point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) applications.

| **[Whenever, Wherever: Towards Orchestrating Crowd Simulations with Spatio-Temporal Spawn Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16639v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic crowd simulations are essential for immersive virtual environments, relying on both individual behaviors (microscopic dynamics) and overall crowd patterns (macroscopic characteristics). While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Predictors in the Presence of Missing and Heterogeneous Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01701v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning approaches achieve outstanding predictive performance in modeling modern data, despite the increasing complexity and scale. However, evaluating the quality of predictive models becomes more challenging, as traditional statistical assumptions often no longer hold. In particular, spatio-temporal data exhibit dependencies across both time and space, often involving nonlinear dynamics, non-stationarities, and missing observations. As a result, advanced predictors such as spatio-temporal graph neural networks require novel evaluation methodologies. This paper introduces a residual correlation analysis framework designed to assess the optimality of spatio-temporal predictive neural models, particularly in scenarios with incomplete and heterogeneous data. By leveraging the principle that residual correlation indicates information not captured by the model, this framework serves as a powerful tool to identify and localize regions in space and time where model performance can be improved. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to operate under minimal assumptions, enabling robust evaluation of deep learning models applied to multivariate time series, even in the presence of missing and heterogeneous data. The methodology employs tailored spatio-temporal graphs to encode sparse spatial and temporal dependencies within the data and utilizes asymptotically distribution-free summary statistics to pinpoint time intervals and spatial regions where the model underperforms. The effectiveness of the proposed residual analysis is demonstrated through validation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios involving state-of-the-art predictive models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Copula-based spatio-temporal modeling of air pollutant data incorporating covariate dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15935v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elevated levels of PM10 are known to cause severe respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and, in extreme cases, cancer and mortality. Despite various reduction policies implemented across different sectors, PM10 concentrations in South Korea continue to exceed the annual recommended limits set by the World Health Organization. Spatio-temporal PM10 concentrations may exhibit both spatial and temporal dependencies. Additionally, interactions between PM10 and environmental factors can further influence the variability in PM10. Therefore, this study proposes a method that incorporates the spatio-temporal neighbors of covariates alongside those of PM10 by adopting an approach that explains spatio-temporal interactions through spatio-temporal neighbors. Vine copulas are used to integrate the pairwise dependence structures between a given location and its surrounding spatio-temporal neighbors. We applied the model to weekly average PM10 data from South Korea in 2019, using PM2.5 and CO as covariates. Given that all three variables exhibited skewness, we assumed the Gumbel and Generalized Extreme Value distributions as marginal distributions. The proposed model outperformed a traditional Bayesian spatio-temporal model, a kriging method, and an alternative copula-based approach, particularly in predicting the top 5% of extreme values, by effectively capturing tail dependencies crucial for extreme value analysis. This study highlights the importance of utilizing vine copulas to effectively model diverse dependency structures in spatio-temporal data while simultaneously accommodating spatial and temporal dimensions, including spatio-temporal dependencies among covariates. The results underscore the broader applicability of the proposed approach to other fields where complex dependency structures are present.</p></details> |  |
| **[BlockDance: Reuse Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal Features to Accelerate Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15927v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generation capabilities, particularly with recent advancements leveraging transformer architectures to improve both visual and artistic quality. However, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) continue to encounter challenges related to low inference speed, primarily due to the iterative denoising process. To address this issue, we propose BlockDance, a training-free approach that explores feature similarities at adjacent time steps to accelerate DiTs. Unlike previous feature-reuse methods that lack tailored reuse strategies for features at different scales, BlockDance prioritizes the identification of the most structurally similar features, referred to as Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal (STSS) features. These features are primarily located within the structure-focused blocks of the transformer during the later stages of denoising. BlockDance caches and reuses these highly similar features to mitigate redundant computation, thereby accelerating DiTs while maximizing consistency with the generated results of the original model. Furthermore, considering the diversity of generated content and the varying distributions of redundant features, we introduce BlockDance-Ada, a lightweight decision-making network tailored for instance-specific acceleration. BlockDance-Ada dynamically allocates resources and provides superior content quality. Both BlockDance and BlockDance-Ada have proven effective across various generation tasks and models, achieving accelerations between 25% and 50% while maintaining generation quality.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

However, these models do not fully capture the complexity of the language learning process of an infant when used in isolation. In this paper, we examine how a model of language acquisition for infants and young children can be constructed and adapted for use in a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN), taking into account the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during child language learning. We introduce a novel approach for predicting child vocabulary acquisition, and evaluate the efficacy of such a model with respect to the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during language acquisition, resulting in insightful observations on model calibration and norm selection. An evaluation of this model found that the mean accuracy of models for predicting new words when using sensorimotor relationships (0.733) and semantic relationships (0.729) were found to be superior to that observed with a 2-layer Feed-forward neural network. Furthermore, the high recall for some relationships suggested that some relationships (e.g. visual) were superior in identifying a larger proportion of relevant words that a child should subsequently learn than others (such as auditory).</p></details> |  |

In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain.</p></details> |  |

However, restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to low-resolution ODVs. Video super-resolution (SR) is proposed to enhance resolution, but practical ODV spatial projection distortions and temporal flickering are not well addressed directly applying existing methods. To achieve better ODV-SR reconstruction, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatially continuous distortion modulation module is introduced to improve discrete projection distortions. Next, we design an interlaced multi-frame reconstruction mechanism to refine temporal consistency across frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive weights during training to concentrate on regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. In general, we explore inference-free and real-world viewing matched strategies to provide an application-friendly method on a novel ODV-SR dataset with practical scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed STDAN over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce SPARTA, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. SPARTA introduces an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion over time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism captures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than focusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further emphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's core, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches, including spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs), often face high memory demands and struggle to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies, limiting their efficiency in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce DynSTG-Mamba (Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Mamba), a novel framework that combines DF-STGNN and STG-Mamba to enhance motion sequence modeling. The DF-STGNN incorporates a dynamic spatio-temporal filter that adaptively adjusts spatial connections between skeletal joints and temporal interactions across different movement phases. This approach ensures better feature propagation through dynamic graph structures by considering the hierarchical nature and dynamics of skeletal gait data. Meanwhile, STG-Mamba, an extension of Mamba adapted for skeletal motion data, ensures a continuous propagation of states, facilitating the capture of long-term dependencies while reducing computational complexity. To reduce the number of model parameters and computational costs while maintaining consistency, we propose Cross-Graph Relational Knowledge Distillation, a novel knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns relational information between teacher (large architecture) and student models (small architecture) while using shared memory. This ensures that the interactions and movement patterns of the joints are accurately preserved in the motion sequences. We validate our DynSTG-Mamba on KOA-NM, PD-WALK, and ATAXIA datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and Recall. Our results highlight the efficiency and robustness of our approach, offering a lightweight yet highly accurate solution for automated gait analysis and movement disorder assessment.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the Query Matching Module (QMM), which uses metric learning to bring queries for the same person closer together across frames compared to queries for different people. Action classes are predicted using the sequence of queries obtained from QMM matching, allowing for variable-length inputs from videos longer than a single clip. Experimental results on JHMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets demonstrate that our method performs well for large position changes of people while offering superior computational efficiency and lower resource requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended version of VISAPP2025</p></details> |

Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |

The complexity arises from the intricate interactions between scales and the interplay of diverse physical processes. Neural operators have emerged as promising models for predicting such dynamics due to their flexibility and computational efficiency. However, they often fail to effectively capture multi-scale interactions or quantify the uncertainties inherent in the predictions. These limitations lead to rapid error accumulation, particularly in long-term forecasting of systems characterized by complex and coupled dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a spatio-temporal Fourier transformer (StFT), in which each transformer block is designed to learn dynamics at a specific scale. By leveraging a structured hierarchy of StFT blocks, the model explicitly captures dynamics across both macro- and micro- spatial scales. Furthermore, a generative residual correction mechanism is integrated to estimate and mitigate predictive uncertainties, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of long-term forecasts. Evaluations conducted on three benchmark datasets (plasma, fluid, and atmospheric dynamics) demonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art ML methods.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

However, can Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) also "reason through a sequential spatio-temporal logic" in videos? Existing Video-LLM benchmarks primarily focus on assessing object presence, neglecting relational reasoning. Consequently, it is difficult to measure whether a model truly comprehends object interactions (actions/events) in videos or merely relies on pre-trained "memory" of co-occurrences as biases in generating answers. In this work, we introduce a Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (V-STaR) benchmark to address these shortcomings. The key idea is to decompose video understanding into a Reverse Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (RSTR) task that simultaneously evaluates what objects are present, when events occur, and where they are located while capturing the underlying Chain-of-thought (CoT) logic.

Nevertheless, conventional Mamba-based models encounter significant challenges in accurately predicting stock time series, as they fail to adequately capture both the overarching market dynamics and the intricate interdependencies among individual stocks. To overcome these constraints, we introduce the Hierarchical Information-Guided Spatio-Temporal Mamba (HIGSTM) framework. HIGSTM introduces Index-Guided Frequency Filtering Decomposition to extract commonality and specificity from time series. The model architecture features a meticulously designed hierarchical framework that systematically captures both temporal dynamic patterns and global static relationships within the stock market. Furthermore, we propose an Information-Guided Mamba that integrates macro informations into the sequence selection process, thereby facilitating more market-conscious decision-making. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on the CSI500, CSI800 and CSI1000 datasets demonstrate that HIGSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Prior work primarily focuses on single-frame cooperative perception, which fuses agents' information across different spatial locations but ignores temporal cues and temporal tasks (e.g., temporal perception and prediction). In this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal fusion in V2X scenarios and design one-step and multi-step communication strategies (when to transmit) as well as examine their integration with three fusion strategies - early, late, and intermediate (what to transmit), providing comprehensive benchmarks with 11 fusion models (how to fuse). Furthermore, we propose V2XPnP, a novel intermediate fusion framework within one-step communication for end-to-end perception and prediction. Our framework employs a unified Transformer-based architecture to effectively model complex spatio-temporal relationships across multiple agents, frames, and high-definition map. Moreover, we introduce the V2XPnP Sequential Dataset that supports all V2X collaboration modes and addresses the limitations of existing real-world datasets, which are restricted to single-frame or single-mode cooperation. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perception and prediction tasks. The codebase and dataset will be released to facilitate future V2X research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website link: https://mobility-lab.seas.ucla.edu/v2xpnp/</p></details> |

Compared to classic STVG locating only a single target, OmniSTVG enables localization of not only an arbitrary number of text-referred targets but also their interacting counterparts in the query from the video, making it more flexible and practical in real scenarios for comprehensive understanding. In order to facilitate exploration of OmniSTVG, we introduce BOSTVG, a large-scale benchmark dedicated to OmniSTVG. Specifically, our BOSTVG consists of 10,018 videos with 10.2M frames and covers a wide selection of 287 classes from diverse scenarios. Each sequence in BOSTVG, paired with a free-form textual query, encompasses a varying number of targets ranging from 1 to 10. To ensure high quality, each video is manually annotated with meticulous inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, BOSTVG is to date the first and the largest benchmark for OmniSTVG. To encourage future research, we introduce a simple yet effective approach, named OmniTube, which, drawing inspiration from Transformer-based STVG methods, is specially designed for OmniSTVG and demonstrates promising results. By releasing BOSTVG, we hope to go beyond classic STVG by locating every object appearing in the query for more comprehensive understanding, opening up a new direction for STVG. Our benchmark, model, and results will be released at https://github.com/JellyYao3000/OmniSTVG.</p></details> |  |

Traditional deep learning approaches have significantly advanced this field, particularly in the stage of ST data mining. However, these models remain task-specific and often require extensive labeled data. Inspired by the success of Foundation Models (FM), especially large language models, researchers have begun exploring the concept of Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models (STFMs) to enhance adaptability and generalization across diverse ST tasks. Unlike prior architectures, STFMs empower the entire workflow of ST data science, ranging from data sensing, management, to mining, thereby offering a more holistic and scalable approach. Despite rapid progress, a systematic study of STFMs for ST data science remains lacking. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of STFMs, categorizing existing methodologies and identifying key research directions to advance ST general intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging with Physics-Guided Increment Training Strategy for Air Quality Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09646v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of sensors for air quality monitoring is constrained by high costs, leading to inadequate network coverage and data deficits in some areas. Utilizing existing observations, spatio-temporal kriging is a method for estimating air quality at unobserved locations during a specific period. Inductive spatio-temporal kriging with increment training strategy has demonstrated its effectiveness using virtual nodes to simulate unobserved nodes. However, a disparity between virtual and real nodes persists, complicating the application of learning patterns derived from virtual nodes to actual unobserved ones. To address these limitations, this paper presents a Physics-Guided Increment Training Strategy (PGITS). Specifically, we design a dynamic graph generation module to incorporate the advection and diffusion processes of airborne particles as physical knowledge into the graph structure, dynamically adjusting the adjacency matrix to reflect physical interactions between nodes. By using physics principles as a bridge between virtual and real nodes, this strategy ensures the features of virtual nodes and their pseudo labels are closer to actual nodes. Consequently, the learned patterns of virtual nodes can be applied to actual unobserved nodes for effective kriging.</p></details> |  |

Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been ACCEPTED as a FULL PAPER at DASFAA 2025</p></details> |

As systems like autonomous driving become increasingly popular, ensuring their safety has become more important than ever. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to quickly and effectively detect various anomalies in the aforementioned systems, with the goal of making them safer and more effective. Many detection systems have been developed with great success under spatial contexts; however, there is still significant room for improvement when it comes to temporal context. While there is substantial work regarding this task, there is minimal work done regarding the efficiency of models and their ability to be applied to scenarios that require real-time inference, i.e., autonomous driving where anomalies need to be detected the moment they are within view. To address this gap, we propose STEAD (Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection), whose backbone is developed using (2+1)D Convolutions and Performer Linear Attention, which ensures computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. When tested on the UCF-Crime benchmark, our base model achieves an AUC of 91.34%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art, and our fast version achieves an AUC of 88.87%, while having 99.70% less parameters and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art as well.

Deep Learning (DL), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), have revolutionized this field by enhancing the accuracy of classification tasks. In this work, a novel approach combining a transformer-based Swin-Unet architecture with seasonal synthesized spatio-temporal images has been employed to classify LC types using spatio-temporal features extracted from Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, organized into seasonal clusters. The study focuses on three distinct regions - Amazonia, Africa, and Siberia - and evaluates the model performance across diverse ecoregions within these areas. By utilizing seasonal feature sequences instead of dense temporal sequences, notable performance improvements have been achieved, especially in regions with temporal data gaps like Siberia, where S1 data distribution is uneven and non-uniform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalization capabilities of the proposed methodology in achieving high overall accuracy (O.A.) values, even in regions with limited training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Reversal Regularization for Spiking Neural Networks: Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Invariance for Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low power computing paradigm. Recent studies have shown that SNNs suffer from severe overfitting, which limits their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Temporal Reversal Regularization (TRR) to mitigate overfitting during training and facilitate generalization of SNNs. We exploit the inherent temporal properties of SNNs to perform input/feature temporal reversal perturbations, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and learn perturbation-invariant representations. To further enhance generalization, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (Hadamard product) for feature hybridization of original and temporally reversed spike firing rates, which expands the implicit dimensionality and acts as a spatio-temporal regularizer. We show theoretically that our method is able to tighten the upper bound of the generalization error, and extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic recognition as well as 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate its effectiveness, versatility, and adversarial robustness. In particular, our regularization significantly improves the recognition accuracy of low-latency SNN for neuromorphic objects, contributing to the real-world deployment of neuromorphic computational software-hardware integration.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Leveraging Consistent Spatio-Temporal Correspondence for Robust Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16923v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to VO have significantly improved performance by using deep networks to predict optical flow between video frames. However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DropletVideo: A Dataset and Approach to Explore Integral Spatio-Temporal Consistent Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06053v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal consistency is a critical research topic in video generation. A qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence while maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying viewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily focuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination, such as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without constraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may introduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby overlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with numerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes increasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral spatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression and camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent generation. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the development of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset, which comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object actions. Each video is annotated with an average caption of 206 words, detailing various camera movements and plot developments. Following this, we developed and trained the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving spatio-temporal coherence during video generation. The DropletVideo dataset and model are accessible at https://dropletx.github.io.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding the predictions from a model is crucial to ensure reliability and trustworthiness, particularly for high-risk applications, such as healthcare and transport. Few existing methods are able to generate explanations for models trained on continuous-time dynamic graph data and, of these, the computational complexity and lack of suitable explanation objectives pose challenges. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{S}$patio-$\textbf{T}$emporal E$\textbf{X}$planation $\textbf{Search}$ (STX-Search), a novel method for generating instance-level explanations that is applicable to static and dynamic temporal graph structures. We introduce a novel search strategy and objective function, to find explanations that are highly faithful and interpretable. When compared with existing methods, STX-Search produces explanations of higher fidelity whilst optimising explanation size to maintain interpretability.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we apply these spatio-temporal compressors to standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed prime-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the versatility of the proposed spatio-temporal compressors and verify the convergence of algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |

State-of-the-art association methods in agriculture are dedicated towards matching larger crops using either high-resolution point clouds or temporally stable features, which are both difficult to obtain for smaller fruit in the field. To address these challenges, we propose a transformer-based architecture that encodes the shape and position of each fruitlet, and propagates and refines these features through a series of transformer encoder layers with alternating self and cross-attention. We demonstrate that our method is able to achieve an F1-score of 92.4% on data collected in a commercial apple orchard and outperforms all baselines and ablations.</p></details> |  |

The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. A computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism has recently been shown to exhibit superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. Our investigation reveals significant challenges related to stability and parameterization when employing the conventional Euler-Forward discretization for this class of models. We report a rigorous theoretical and empirical demonstration that these challenges can be effectively addressed by adopting an alternative discretization approach - the Symplectic Euler method, allowing to improve over state-of-the-art performances on common event-based benchmark datasets. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences without any normalization techniques.</p></details> |  |

Here we present new generally applicable methodology to perform this task. We introduce a parsimonious representation of seasonality and a biologically informed specification of the outbreak component to avoid parameter identifiability issues. We develop a computationally efficient Bayesian inference methodology for the proposed models, including techniques to detect outbreaks by computing marginal posterior probabilities at each spatial location and time point. We show that it is possible to efficiently integrate out the discrete parameters associated with outbreak states, enabling the use of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) as a complementary alternative to a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce a robust Bayesian model comparison framework based on importance sampling to approximate model evidence in high-dimensional space. The performance of our methodology is validated through systematic simulation studies, where simulated outbreaks were successfully detected, and our model comparison strategy demonstrates strong reliability. We also apply our new methodology to monthly incidence data on invasive meningococcal disease from 28 European countries. The results highlight outbreaks across multiple countries and months, with model comparison analysis showing that the new specification outperforms previous approaches.

STMA is built upon three critical components: (1) a spatio-temporal memory module that captures historical and environmental changes in real time, (2) a dynamic knowledge graph that facilitates adaptive spatial reasoning, and (3) a planner-critic mechanism that iteratively refines task strategies. We evaluate STMA in the TextWorld environment on 32 tasks, involving multi-step planning and exploration under varying levels of complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that STMA achieves a 31.25% improvement in success rate and a 24.7% increase in average score compared to the state-of-the-art model.

To address these limitations, this paper presents the Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer framework (STGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation in videos. First, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal criss-cross Graph (STG) attention mechanism, designed to more effectively leverage the inherent graph priors of the human body within continuous sequence distributions while capturing spatiotemporal long-range dependencies. Next, we present a dual-path Modulated Hop-wise Regular GCN (MHR-GCN) to independently process temporal and spatial dimensions in parallel, preserving features rich in temporal dynamics and the original or high-dimensional representations of spatial structures. Furthermore, the module leverages modulation to optimize parameter efficiency and incorporates spatiotemporal hop-wise skip connections to capture higher-order information. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPIINF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the Hierarchical Federated Learning Transformer Network (H-FLTN) framework to address these challenges. H-FLTN employs a three-tier hierarchical architecture comprising EVs, community Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS), and the Energy Provider Data Centre (EPDC) to enable accurate spatio-temporal predictions of EV charging needs while preserving privacy. Temporal prediction is enhanced using Transformer-based learning, capturing complex dependencies in charging behavior. Privacy is ensured through Secure Aggregation, Additive Secret Sharing, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Sharing with Augmentation, which allow only secret shares of model weights to be exchanged while securing all transmissions. To improve training efficiency and resource management, H-FLTN integrates Dynamic Client Capping Mechanism (DCCM) and Client Rotation Management (CRM), ensuring that training remains both computationally and temporally efficient as the number of participating EVs increases. DCCM optimises client participation by limiting excessive computational loads, while CRM balances training contributions across epochs, preventing imbalanced participation. Our simulation results based on large-scale empirical vehicle mobility data reveal that DCCM and CRM reduce the training time complexity with increasing EVs from linear to constant. Its integration into real-world smart city infrastructure enhances energy demand forecasting, resource allocation, and grid stability, ensuring reliability and sustainability in future mobility ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 tables, 2 figures, Journal Paper</p></details> |

Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against 11 baselines.</p></details> |  |

The objective is to provide a quality score to ensure correct performance and achieve desired results. To achieve this goal, a new graph-based model, the Dense Spatio-Temporal Graph Conv-GRU Network with Transformer, is introduced. This model combines a modified version of STGCN and transformer architectures for efficient handling of spatio-temporal data. The key idea is to consider skeleton data respecting its non-linear structure as a graph and detecting joints playing the main role in each rehabilitation exercise. Dense connections and GRU mechanisms are used to rapidly process large 3D skeleton inputs and effectively model temporal dynamics. The transformer encoder's attention mechanism focuses on relevant parts of the input sequence, making it useful for evaluating rehabilitation exercises. The evaluation of our proposed approach on the KIMORE and UI-PRMD datasets highlighted its potential, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational time. This resulted in faster and more accurate learning and assessment of rehabilitation exercises.

However, traditional approaches to assess patient actions often rely on manual observation and scoring, which are subjective and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for patient action assessment using a Multi-Residual Spatio Temporal Graph Network (MR-STGN) that incorporates both angular and positional 3D skeletons. The MR-STGN is specifically designed to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of patient actions. It achieves this by integrating information from multiple residual layers, with each layer extracting features at distinct levels of abstraction. Furthermore, we integrate an attention fusion mechanism into the network, which facilitates the adaptive weighting of various features. This empowers the model to concentrate on the most pertinent aspects of the patient's movements, offering precise instructions regarding specific body parts or movements that require attention. Ablation studies are conducted to analyze the impact of individual components within the proposed model. We evaluate our model on the UI-PRMD dataset demonstrating its performance in accurately predicting real-time patient action scores, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, maintaining its adaptability under diverse object properties and complex working conditions remains challenging. This article highlights the importance of completely representing spatio-temporal features of slip, and proposes a novel approach for incipient slip modeling and detection. Based on the analysis of localized displacement phenomenon, we establish the relationship between the characteristic strain rate extreme events and the local slip state. This approach enables the detection of both the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of stick-slip regions. Also, the proposed method can be applied to strain distribution sensing devices, such as vision-based tactile sensors. Simulations and prototype experiments validated the effectiveness of this approach under varying contact conditions, including different contact geometries, friction coefficients, and combined loads. Experiments demonstrated that this method not only accurately and reliably delineates incipient slip, but also facilitates friction parameter estimation and adaptive grasping control.</p></details> | 21 pages, 19 figures |

However, most approaches are based on the assumption of the availability of and accessibility to a sufficiently dense data source, which is rather the rare case in reality. Traffic sensors in road networks are generally highly sparse in their distribution: fleet-based traffic sensing is sparse in space but also sparse in time. There are also other traffic application, besides road traffic, like moving objects in the marine space, where observations are sparsely and arbitrarily distributed in space. In this paper, we tackle the problem of traffic prediction on sparse and spatially irregular and non-deterministic traffic observations. We draw a border between imputations and this work as we consider high sparsity rates and no fixed sensor locations. We advance correlation mining methods with a Sparse Unstructured Spatio Temporal Reconstruction (SUSTeR) framework that reconstructs traffic states from sparse non-stationary observations. For the prediction the framework creates a hidden context traffic state which is enriched in a residual fashion with each observation. Such an assimilated hidden traffic state can be used by existing traffic prediction methods to predict future traffic states. We query these states with query locations from the spatial domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted and presented at ACM SIGSPATIAL '23</p></details> |

However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos. Our method demonstrates significant superiority in extensive experiments compared to current baselines.

| **[Generative AI Enables EEG Super-Resolution via Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089v5)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which are then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

With around 2000 ball events per game, their precise and exhaustive annotation based on a monocular video stream remains a tedious and costly manual task. While state-of-the-art spatio-temporal action detection methods show promise for automating this task, they lack contextual understanding of the game. Assuming professional players' behaviors are interdependent, we hypothesize that incorporating surrounding players' information such as positions, velocity and team membership can enhance purely visual predictions. We propose a spatio-temporal action detection approach that combines visual and game state information via Graph Neural Networks trained end-to-end with state-of-the-art 3D CNNs, demonstrating improved metrics through game state integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Fixed Variables: Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatio-temporal Focal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15296v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research focus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |

Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part I of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as the gold standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow and reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore, precise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between their main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately quantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences remains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and ambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we introduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level semantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a spatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing DSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet introduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel details across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and improve vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture global context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CA segmentation, achieving a Dice of 0.9033.</p></details> | Published by TMI |
| **[Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Uncertainty Quantification for Distributed Energy Adoption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12193v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) has introduced significant spatio-temporal uncertainties in power grid management, necessitating accurate multilevel forecasting methods. However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</p></details> |  |

They primarily emphasize temporal sharing while overlooking spatial and spectral dimensions. We propose an adaptive, AI-driven spectrum-sharing framework within the O-RAN architecture, integrating discriminative and generative AI (GenAI) to forecast spectrum needs across multiple timescales and spatial granularities. A marketplace model, managed by an authorized spectrum broker, enables operators to trade spectrum dynamically, balancing static assignments with real-time trading. GenAI enhances traffic prediction, spectrum estimation, and allocation, optimizing utilization while reducing costs. This modular, flexible approach fosters operator collaboration, maximizing efficiency and revenue. A key research challenge is refining allocation granularity and spatio-temporal dynamics beyond existing models.</p></details> |  |

Discretization in space is based on the theory of geometric quantization, which yields a spatially discretized analogue of the MHD equations as a finite-dimensional Lie--Poisson system on the dual of the magnetic extension Lie algebra $\mathfrak{f}=\mathfrak{su}(N)\ltimes\mathfrak{su}(N)^{*}$. We also give accompanying structure preserving time discretizations for Lie--Poisson systems on the dual of semi-direct product Lie algebras of the form $\mathfrak{f}=\mathfrak{g}\ltimes\mathfrak{g^{*}}$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is a $J$-quadratic Lie algebra. The time integration method is free of computationally costly matrix exponentials. We prove that the full method preserves a modified Lie--Poisson structure and corresponding Casimir functions, and that the modified structure and Casimirs converge to the continuous ones. The method is demonstrated for two models of magnetic fluids: incompressible magnetohydrodynamics and Hazeltine's model.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, convergence results for Casimirs added in sect. 3, typos corrected</p></details> |

We propose AQ-Net, a spatiotemporal reanalysis model for both observed and unobserved stations in the near future. AQ-Net utilizes the LSTM and multi-head attention for the temporal regression. We also propose a cyclic encoding technique to ensure continuous time representation. To learn fine-grained spatial air quality estimation, we incorporate AQ-Net with the neural kNN to explore feature-based interpolation, such that we can fill the spatial gaps given coarse observation stations. To demonstrate the efficiency of our model for spatiotemporal reanalysis, we use data from 2013-2017 collected in northern China for PM2.5 analysis. Extensive experiments show that AQ-Net excels in air quality reanalysis, highlighting the potential of hybrid spatio-temporal models to better capture environmental dynamics, especially in urban areas where both spatial and temporal variability are critical.</p></details> |  |

Existing spatio-temporal data secure retrieval schemes have significant shortcomings regarding dynamic updates, either compromising privacy through leakage during updates (forward insecurity) or incurring excessively high update costs that hinder practical application. Under these circumstances, we first propose a basic filter-based spatio-temporal range query scheme \TrinityI that supports low-cost dynamic updates and automatic expansion. Furthermore, to improve security, reduce storage cost, and false positives, we propose a forward secure and verifiable scheme \TrinityII that simultaneously minimizes storage overhead. A formal security analysis proves that \TrinityI and \TrinityII are Indistinguishable under Selective Chosen-Plaintext Attack (IND-SCPA). Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our design \TrinityII significantly reduces storage requirements by 80\%, enables data retrieval at the 1 million-record level in just 0.01 seconds, and achieves 10 $\times$ update efficiency than state-of-art.</p></details> | 14pages,6 figures |

Naturally, automated detection of forged Deepfake videos is attracting a proportional amount of interest of researchers. Current methods for detecting forged videos mainly rely on global frame features and under-utilize the spatio-temporal inconsistencies found in the manipulated videos. Moreover, they fail to attend to manipulation-specific subtle and well-localized pattern variations along both spatial and temporal dimensions. Addressing these gaps, we propose a neural Deepfake detector that focuses on the localized manipulative signatures of the forged videos at individual frame level as well as frame sequence level. Using a ResNet backbone, it strengthens the shallow frame-level feature learning with a spatial attention mechanism. The spatial stream of the model is further helped by fusing texture enhanced shallow features with the deeper features. Simultaneously, the model processes frame sequences with a distance attention mechanism that further allows fusion of temporal attention maps with the learned features at the deeper layers. The overall model is trained to detect forged content as a classifier. We evaluate our method on two popular large data sets and achieve significant performance over the state-of-the-art methods.Moreover, our technique also provides memory and computational advantages over the competitive techniques.</p></details> |  |

Full-scale resolving simulations for systems such as highly turbulent flows are not feasible in the foreseeable future, and reduced-order models must capture dynamics that involve interactions across scales. In the present work, we propose a novel framework, Graph-based Learning of Effective Dynamics (Graph-LED), that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs), as well as an attention-based autoregressive model, to extract the effective dynamics from a small amount of simulation data. GNNs represent flow fields on unstructured meshes as graphs and effectively handle complex geometries and non-uniform grids. The proposed method combines a GNN based, dimensionality reduction for variable-size unstructured meshes with an autoregressive temporal attention model that can learn temporal dependencies automatically. We evaluated the proposed approach on a suite of fluid dynamics problems, including flow past a cylinder and flow over a backward-facing step over a range of Reynolds numbers. The results demonstrate robust and effective forecasting of spatio-temporal physics; in the case of the flow past a cylinder, both small-scale effects that occur close to the cylinder as well as its wake are accurately captured.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Parsimony and Learning (CPAL)</p></details> |

Real-world measurements of such processes are often collected at irregularly distributed points in space, which can be effectively represented as graphs; however, there are currently only a few existing datasets. Our work aims to make advancements in the field of PDE-modeling accessible to the temporal graph machine learning community, while addressing the data scarcity problem, by creating and utilizing datasets based on PDEs. In this work, we create and use synthetic datasets based on PDEs to support spatio-temporal graph modeling in machine learning for different applications.

In particular, ride-hailing vehicles can effectively facilitate flexible data collection and contribute towards urban intelligence, despite resource limitations. Therefore, this work explores a promising scenario, where edge-assisted vehicles perform joint tasks of order serving and the emerging foundation model fine-tuning using various urban data. However, integrating the VCS AI task with the conventional order serving task is challenging, due to their inconsistent spatio-temporal characteristics: (i) The distributions of ride orders and data point-of-interests (PoIs) may not coincide in geography, both following a priori unknown patterns; (ii) they have distinct forms of temporal effects, i.e., prolonged waiting makes orders become instantly invalid while data with increased staleness gradually reduces its utility for model fine-tuning.To overcome these obstacles, we propose an online framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with careful augmentation. A new quality-of-service (QoS) metric is designed to characterize and balance the utility of the two joint tasks, under the effects of varying data volumes and staleness. We also integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) with MARL to enhance state representations, capturing graph-structured, time-varying dependencies among vehicles and across locations. Extensive experiments on our testbed simulator, utilizing various real-world foundation model fine-tuning tasks and the New York City Taxi ride order dataset, demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

This progress enables applications such as match outcome prediction, player scouting, and tactical analysis. In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data, primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab, an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab's effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization.

A continuous-time model incorporating universal series-parallel stator winding connection and radial permanent magnet fluxes is developed in the stator variables and transformed into the rotor reference frame, including also the electromagnetic torque. The transformed model undergoes discretization using the matrix exponential-based technique, wherein the electrical angular velocity and angle are considered time-varying parameters. The resulting model is subsequently expanded to consider the motor connection resistance via perturbation techniques. In the laboratory experiments, we validate the dynamical properties of the derived model by comparing its outputs with the experimental data and waveforms generated by the forward Euler-based discrete-time approximation.</p></details> |  |

Most works in this area use a discrete-time formulation, which is prone to induced errors, and often not applicable to models with higher-order/black-box solvers. The objective of this study is to develop a disciplined approach to fine-tune diffusion models using continuous-time RL, formulated as a stochastic control problem with a reward function that aligns the end result (terminal state) with input prompt. The key idea is to treat score matching as controls or actions, and thereby making connections to policy optimization and regularization in continuous-time RL. To carry out this idea, we lay out a new policy optimization framework for continuous-time RL, and illustrate its potential in enhancing the value networks design space via leveraging the structural property of diffusion models. We validate the advantages of our method by experiments in downstream tasks of fine-tuning large-scale Text2Image models of Stable Diffusion v1.5.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.08400</p></details> |

Data-driven models offer a promising solution, but acquiring the requisite data remains expensive and is potentially unsafe. Safe active learning techniques prove essential, enabling the learning of high-quality models with minimal expensive data points and high safety. This paper introduces a safe active learning framework tailored for time-varying systems, addressing drift, seasonal changes, and complexities due to dynamic behavior. The proposed Time-aware Integrated Mean Squared Prediction Error (T-IMSPE) method minimizes posterior variance over current and future states, optimizing information gathering also in the time domain. Empirical results highlight T-IMSPE's advantages in model quality through toy and real-world examples. State of the art Gaussian processes are compatible with T-IMSPE. Our theoretical contributions include a clear delineation which Gaussian process kernels, domains, and weighting measures are suitable for T-IMSPE and even beyond for its non-time aware predecessor IMSPE.</p></details> |  |

Test-time adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting models during inference without requiring labeled test data or access to the original training set. While research has explored TTA from various perspectives like algorithmic complexity, data and class distribution shifts, model architectures, and offline versus continuous learning, constraints specific to mobile and edge devices remain underexplored. We propose BoTTA, a benchmark designed to evaluate TTA methods under practical constraints on mobile and edge devices. Our evaluation targets four key challenges caused by limited resources and usage conditions: (i) limited test samples, (ii) limited exposure to categories, (iii) diverse distribution shifts, and (iv) overlapping shifts within a sample. We assess state-of-the-art TTA methods under these scenarios using benchmark datasets and report system-level metrics on a real testbed. Furthermore, unlike prior work, we align with on-device requirements by advocating periodic adaptation instead of continuous inference-time adaptation. Experiments reveal key insights: many recent TTA algorithms struggle with small datasets, fail to generalize to unseen categories, and depend on the diversity and complexity of distribution shifts. BoTTA also reports device-specific resource use. For example, while SHOT improves accuracy by $2.25\times$ with $512$ adaptation samples, it uses $1.08\times$ peak memory on Raspberry Pi versus the base model. BoTTA offers actionable guidance for TTA in real-world, resource-constrained deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the calibration of Just-in-time Defect Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12051v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Just in time defect prediction (JIT DP) leverages ML to identify defect-prone code commits, enabling quality assurance (QA) teams to allocate resources more efficiently by focusing on commits that are most likely to contain defects. Although JIT DP techniques have introduced improvements in terms of predictive accuracy, they are still susceptible to misclassification errors such as false positives and negatives. This can lead to wasted resources or undetected defects, a particularly critical concern when QA resources are limited. To mitigate these challenges and preserve the practical utility of JIT DP tools, it becomes essential to estimate the reliability of the predictions, i.e., computing confidence scores. Such scores can help practitioners determine the trustworthiness of predictions and thus prioritize them efficiently. A simple approach to computing confidence scores is to extract, alongside each prediction, the corresponding prediction probabilities and use them as indicators of confidence. However, for these probabilities to reliably serve as confidence scores, the predictive model must be well-calibrated. This means that the prediction probabilities must accurately represent the true likelihood of each prediction being correct. Miscalibration, common in modern ML models, distorts probability scores such that they do not align with the actual correctness probability. In this study, we evaluate the calibration of three JIT DP techniques to determine whether and to what extent they exhibit poor calibration. Furthermore, we assess whether post-calibration methods can improve the calibration of existing JIT defect prediction models. Our results reveal that all evaluated JIT DP models exhibit some level of miscalibration, with ECE ranging from 2-35%. Furthermore, post-calibration methods do not consistently improve the calibration.</p></details> |  |

However, time series class-incremental learning (TSCIL) faces two major challenges: catastrophic forgetting and intra-class variations. Catastrophic forgetting occurs because gradient-based parameter update strategies inevitably erase past knowledge. And unlike images, time series data exhibits subject-specific patterns, also known as intra-class variations, which refer to differences in patterns observed within the same class. While exemplar-based methods fail to cover diverse variation with limited samples, existing exemplar-free methods lack explicit mechanisms to handle intra-class variations. To address these two challenges, we propose TS-ACL, which leverages a gradient-free closed-form solution to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem inherent in gradient-based optimization methods while simultaneously learning global distributions to resolve intra-class variations. Additionally, it provides privacy protection and efficiency. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets covering various sensor modalities and tasks demonstrate that TS-ACL achieves performance close to joint training on four datasets, outperforming existing methods and establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for TSCIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

The main property to ensure the convergence thereof is the regularity of the approximation (in the vocabulary of discrete approximation schemes). In a previous work the existence of discrete operators $T_n$ which converge to $T$ in a discrete norm was shown to be sufficient to obtain regularity. Although this framework proved useful for many applications for some instances the former assumption is too strong. Thus in the present article we report a weaker criterion for which the discrete operators $T_n$ only have to converge point-wise, but in addition a weak T-coercivity condition has to be satisfied on the discrete level. We apply the new framework to prove the convergence of certain $H^1$-conforming finite element discretizations of the damped time-harmonic Galbrun's equation, which is used to model the oscillations of stars. A main ingredient in the latter analysis is the uniformly stable invertibility of the divergence operator on certain spaces, which is related to the topic of divergence free elements for the Stokes equation.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |

| **[Hardware-Friendly Delayed-Feedback Reservoir for Multivariate Time-Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11981v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir computing (RC) is attracting attention as a machine-learning technique for edge computing. In time-series classification tasks, the number of features obtained using a reservoir depends on the length of the input series. Therefore, the features must be converted to a constant-length intermediate representation (IR), such that they can be processed by an output layer. Existing conversion methods involve computationally expensive matrix inversion that significantly increases the circuit size and requires processing power when implemented in hardware. In this article, we propose a simple but effective IR, namely, dot-product-based reservoir representation (DPRR), for RC based on the dot product of data features. Additionally, we propose a hardware-friendly delayed-feedback reservoir (DFR) consisting of a nonlinear element and delayed feedback loop with DPRR. The proposed DFR successfully classified multivariate time series data that has been considered particularly difficult to implement efficiently in hardware. In contrast to conventional DFR models that require analog circuits, the proposed model can be implemented in a fully digital manner suitable for high-level syntheses. A comparison with existing machine-learning methods via field-programmable gate array implementation using 12 multivariate time-series classification tasks confirmed the superior accuracy and small circuit size of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADAT: Time-Series-Aware Adaptive Transformer Architecture for Sign Language Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11942v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current sign language machine translation systems rely on recognizing hand movements, facial expressions and body postures, and natural language processing, to convert signs into text. Recent approaches use Transformer architectures to model long-range dependencies via positional encoding. However, they lack accuracy in recognizing fine-grained, short-range temporal dependencies between gestures captured at high frame rates. Moreover, their high computational complexity leads to inefficient training. To mitigate these issues, we propose an Adaptive Transformer (ADAT), which incorporates components for enhanced feature extraction and adaptive feature weighting through a gating mechanism to emphasize contextually relevant features while reducing training overhead and maintaining translation accuracy. To evaluate ADAT, we introduce MedASL, the first public medical American Sign Language dataset. In sign-to-gloss-to-text experiments, ADAT outperforms the encoder-decoder transformer, improving BLEU-4 accuracy by 0.1% while reducing training time by 14.33% on PHOENIX14T and 3.24% on MedASL. In sign-to-text experiments, it improves accuracy by 8.7% and reduces training time by 2.8% on PHOENIX14T and achieves 4.7% higher accuracy and 7.17% faster training on MedASL. Compared to encoder-only and decoder-only baselines in sign-to-text, ADAT is at least 6.8% more accurate despite being up to 12.1% slower due to its dual-stream structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChatTS: Aligning Time Series with LLMs via Synthetic Data for Enhanced Understanding and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03104v3)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding time series is crucial for its application in real-world scenarios. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to time series tasks, leveraging their strong language capabilities to enhance various applications. However, research on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for time series understanding and reasoning remains limited, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align time series with textual information. This paper introduces ChatTS, a novel MLLM designed for time series analysis. ChatTS treats time series as a modality, similar to how vision MLLMs process images, enabling it to perform both understanding and reasoning with time series. To address the scarcity of training data, we propose an attribute-based method for generating synthetic time series with detailed attribute descriptions. We further introduce Time Series Evol-Instruct, a novel approach that generates diverse time series Q&As, enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, ChatTS is the first TS-MLLM that takes multivariate time series as input for understanding and reasoning, which is fine-tuned exclusively on synthetic datasets. We evaluate its performance using benchmark datasets with real-world data, including six alignment tasks and four reasoning tasks. Our results show that ChatTS significantly outperforms existing vision-based MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and text/agent-based LLMs, achieving a 46.0% improvement in alignment tasks and a 25.8% improvement in reasoning tasks. We have open-sourced the source code, model checkpoint and datasets at https://github.com/NetManAIOps/ChatTS.</p></details> | accepted by VLDB' 25 |
| **[A Real-time Anomaly Detection Method for Robots based on a Flexible and Sparse Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11170v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for robots to operate effectively in diverse environments necessitates the need for robust real-time anomaly detection techniques during robotic operations. However, deep learning-based models in robotics face significant challenges due to limited training data and highly noisy signal features. In this paper, we present Sparse Masked Autoregressive Flow-based Adversarial AutoEncoders model to address these problems. This approach integrates Masked Autoregressive Flow model into Adversarial AutoEncoders to construct a flexible latent space and utilize Sparse autoencoder to efficiently focus on important features, even in scenarios with limited feature space. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a 4.96% to 9.75% higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for pick-and-place robotic operations with randomly placed cans, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it showed up to 19.67% better performance in scenarios involving collisions with lightweight objects. Additionally, unlike the existing state-of-the-art model, our model performs inferences within 1 millisecond, ensuring real-time anomaly detection. These capabilities make our model highly applicable to machine learning-based robotic safety systems in dynamic environments. The code will be made publicly available after acceptance.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Real-Time Shape Estimation of Tensegrity Structures Using Strut Inclination Angles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11868v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensegrity structures are becoming widely used in robotics, such as continuously bending soft manipulators and mobile robots to explore unknown and uneven environments dynamically. Estimating their shape, which is the foundation of their state, is essential for establishing control. However, on-board sensor-based shape estimation remains difficult despite its importance, because tensegrity structures lack well-defined joints, which makes it challenging to use conventional angle sensors such as potentiometers or encoders for shape estimation. To our knowledge, no existing work has successfully achieved shape estimation using only onboard sensors such as Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). This study addresses this issue by proposing a novel approach that uses energy minimization to estimate the shape. We validated our method through experiments on a simple Class 1 tensegrity structure, and the results show that the proposed algorithm can estimate the real-time shape of the structure using onboard sensors, even in the presence of external disturbances.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior work, we identify a new time-exciting threat model against IVN. These attacks inject malicious messages that exhibit a time-exciting effect, gradually manipulating network traffic to disrupt vehicle operations and compromise safety-critical functions. We systematically analyze the characteristics of the threat: dynamism, time-exciting impact, and low prior knowledge dependency. To validate its practicality, we replicate the attack on a real Advanced Driver Assistance System via Controller Area Network (CAN), exploiting Unified Diagnostic Service vulnerabilities and proposing four attack strategies. While CAN's integrity checks mitigate attacks, Ethernet migration (e.g., DoIP/SOME/IP) introduces new surfaces. We further investigate the feasibility of time-exciting threat under SOME/IP. To detect time-exciting threat, we introduce MDHP-Net, leveraging Multi-Dimentional Hawkes Process (MDHP) and temporal and message-wise feature extracting structures. Meanwhile, to estimate MDHP parameters, we developed the first GPU-optimized gradient descent solver for MDHP (MDHP-GDS). These modules significantly improves the detection rate under time-exciting attacks in multi-ECU IVN system. To address data scarcity, we release STEIA9, the first open-source dataset for time-exciting attacks, covering 9 Ethernet-based attack scenarios. Extensive experiments on STEIA9 (9 attack scenarios) show MDHP-Net outperforms 3 baselines, confirming attack feasibility and detection efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.10258</p></details> |

Although these approaches show the potential of Transformers in capturing long-range graph topology information, issues concerning the quadratic complexity and high computing energy consumption severely limit the scalability of GTs on large-scale graphs. Recently, as brain-inspired neural networks, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), facilitate the development of graph representation learning methods with lower computational and storage overhead through the unique event-driven spiking neurons. Inspired by these characteristics, we propose a linear-time Graph Transformer using Spiking Vector Quantization (GT-SVQ) for node classification. GT-SVQ reconstructs codebooks based on rate coding outputs from spiking neurons, and injects the codebooks into self-attention blocks to aggregate global information in linear complexity. Besides, spiking vector quantization effectively alleviates codebook collapse and the reliance on complex machinery (distance measure, auxiliary loss, etc.) present in previous vector quantization-based graph learning methods. In experiments, we compare GT-SVQ with other state-of-the-art baselines on node classification datasets ranging from small to large. Experimental results show that GT-SVQ has achieved competitive performances on most datasets while maintaining up to 130x faster inference speed compared to other GTs.</p></details> | work in progress |

We present DECONET, a first-of-its-kind decoding system that scales to thousands of logical qubits and supports logical operations implemented through lattice surgery. DECONET organizes compute resources in a network-integrated hybrid tree-grid structure, which results in minimal latency increase and no throughput degradation as the system grows. Specifically, DECONET can be scaled to any arbitrary number of $l$ logical qubits by increasing the compute resources by $O(l \times log(l))$, which provides the required $O(l)$ growth in I/O resources while incurring only an $O(log(l))$ increase in latency-a modest growth that is sufficient for thousands of logical qubits. Moreover, we analytically show that the scaling approach preserves throughput, keeping DECONET backlog-free for any number of logical qubits. We report an exploratory prototype of DECONET, called DECONET/HELIOS, built with five VMK-180 FPGAs, that successfully decodes 100 logical qubits of distance five. For 100 logical qubits, under a phenomenological noise rate of 0.1%, the DECONET/HELIOS has an average latency of 2.40 {\mu}s and an inverse throughput of 0.84 {\mu}s per measurement round.</p></details> |  |

A Survey on Test-Time Scaling in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24235v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As enthusiasm for scaling computation (data and parameters) in the pretraining era gradually diminished, test-time scaling (TTS), also referred to as ``test-time computing'' has emerged as a prominent research focus. Recent studies demonstrate that TTS can further elicit the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling significant breakthroughs not only in specialized reasoning tasks, such as mathematics and coding, but also in general tasks like open-ended Q&A. However, despite the explosion of recent efforts in this area, there remains an urgent need for a comprehensive survey offering a systemic understanding. To fill this gap, we propose a unified, multidimensional framework structured along four core dimensions of TTS research: what to scale, how to scale, where to scale, and how well to scale. Building upon this taxonomy, we conduct an extensive review of methods, application scenarios, and assessment aspects, and present an organized decomposition that highlights the unique functional roles of individual techniques within the broader TTS landscape. From this analysis, we distill the major developmental trajectories of TTS to date and offer hands-on guidelines for practical deployment. Furthermore, we identify several open challenges and offer insights into promising future directions, including further scaling, clarifying the functional essence of techniques, generalizing to more tasks, and more attributions.

We use the forest proximities in connection with Multi-Dimensional Scaling to obtain vector embeddings of univariate time series, comparing the embeddings to those obtained using various time series distance measures. We also use the forest proximities alongside Local Outlier Factors to investigate the connection between misclassified points and outliers, comparing with nearest neighbor classifiers which use time series distance measures. We show that the forest proximities seem to exhibit a stronger connection between misclassified points and outliers than nearest neighbor classifiers.</p></details> |  |

| **[Linearity, Time Invariance, and Passivity of a Novice Person in Human Teleoperation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11653v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-cost teleguidance of medical procedures is becoming essential to provide healthcare to remote and underserved communities. Human teleoperation is a promising new method for guiding a novice person with relatively high precision and efficiency through a mixed reality (MR) interface. Prior work has shown that the novice, or "follower", can reliably track the MR input with performance not unlike a telerobotic system. As a consequence, it is of interest to understand and control the follower's dynamics to optimize the system performance and permit stable and transparent bilateral teleoperation. To this end, linearity, time-invariance, inter-axis coupling, and passivity are important in teleoperation and controller design. This paper therefore explores these effects with regard to the follower person in human teleoperation. It is demonstrated through modeling and experiments that the follower can indeed be treated as approximately linear and time invariant, with little coupling and a large excess of passivity at practical frequencies. Furthermore, a stochastic model of the follower dynamics is derived. These results will permit controller design and analysis to improve the performance of human teleoperation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Achieving Tighter Finite-Time Rates for Heterogeneous Federated Stochastic Approximation under Markovian Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11645v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by collaborative reinforcement learning (RL) and optimization with time-correlated data, we study a generic federated stochastic approximation problem involving $M$ agents, where each agent is characterized by an agent-specific (potentially nonlinear) local operator. The goal is for the agents to communicate intermittently via a server to find the root of the average of the agents' local operators. The generality of our setting stems from allowing for (i) Markovian data at each agent and (ii) heterogeneity in the roots of the agents' local operators. The limited recent work that has accounted for both these features in a federated setting fails to guarantee convergence to the desired point or to show any benefit of collaboration; furthermore, they rely on projection steps in their algorithms to guarantee bounded iterates. Our work overcomes each of these limitations. We develop a novel algorithm titled \texttt{FedHSA}, and prove that it guarantees convergence to the correct point, while enjoying an $M$-fold linear speedup in sample-complexity due to collaboration. To our knowledge, \emph{this is the first finite-time result of its kind}, and establishing it (without relying on a projection step) entails a fairly intricate argument that accounts for the interplay between complex temporal correlations due to Markovian sampling, multiple local steps to save communication, and the drift-effects induced by heterogeneous local operators. Our results have implications for a broad class of heterogeneous federated RL problems (e.g., policy evaluation and control) with function approximation, where the agents' Markov decision processes can differ in their probability transition kernels and reward functions.</p></details> |  |

In this research, we explore the application of Double DQN (DDQN) and Dueling Network Architectures, to financial trading tasks using historical SP500 index data. Our focus is training agents capable of optimizing trading strategies while accounting for practical constraints such as transaction costs. The study evaluates the model performance across scenarios with and without commissions, highlighting the impact of cost-sensitive environments on reward dynamics. Despite computational limitations and the inherent complexity of financial time series data, the agent successfully learned meaningful trading policies. The findings confirm that RL agents, even when trained on limited datasets, can outperform random strategies by leveraging advanced architectures such as DDQN and Dueling Networks. However, significant challenges persist, particularly with a sub-optimal policy due to the complexity of data source.</p></details> |  |
| **[MULTI-LF: A Unified Continuous Learning Framework for Real-Time DDoS Detection in Multi-Environment Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11575v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in Multi-Environment (M-En) networks presents significant challenges due to diverse malicious traffic patterns and the evolving nature of cyber threats. Existing AI-based detection systems struggle to adapt to new attack strategies and lack real-time attack detection capabilities with high accuracy and efficiency. This study proposes an online, continuous learning methodology for DDoS detection in M-En networks, enabling continuous model updates and real-time adaptation to emerging threats, including zero-day attacks. First, we develop a unique M-En network dataset by setting up a realistic, real-time simulation using the NS-3 tool, incorporating both victim and bot devices. DDoS attacks with varying packet sizes are simulated using the DDoSim application across IoT and traditional IP-based environments under M-En network criteria. Our approach employs a multi-level framework (MULTI-LF) featuring two machine learning models: a lightweight Model 1 (M1) trained on a selective, critical packet dataset for fast and efficient initial detection, and a more complex, highly accurate Model 2 (M2) trained on extensive data. When M1 exhibits low confidence in its predictions, the decision is escalated to M2 for verification and potential fine-tuning of M1 using insights from M2. If both models demonstrate low confidence, the system flags the incident for human intervention, facilitating model updates with human-verified categories to enhance adaptability to unseen attack patterns. We validate the MULTI-LF through real-world simulations, demonstrating superior classification accuracy of 0.999 and low prediction latency of 0.866 seconds compared to established baselines. Furthermore, we evaluate performance in terms of memory usage (3.632 MB) and CPU utilization (10.05%) in real-time scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic Adaptive Moving-window Service Patrolling for Real-time Incident Management during High-impact Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11570v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the Traffic Adaptive Moving-window Patrolling Algorithm (TAMPA), designed to improve real-time incident management during major events like sports tournaments and concerts. Such events significantly stress transportation networks, requiring efficient and adaptive patrol solutions. TAMPA integrates predictive traffic modeling and real-time complaint estimation, dynamically optimizing patrol deployment. Using dynamic programming, the algorithm continuously adjusts patrol strategies within short planning windows, effectively balancing immediate response and efficient routing. Leveraging the Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality, TAMPA detects significant shifts in complaint patterns, triggering proactive adjustments in patrol routes. Theoretical analyses ensure performance remains closely aligned with optimal solutions. Simulation results from an urban traffic network demonstrate TAMPA's superior performance, showing improvements of approximately 87.5\% over stationary methods and 114.2\% over random strategies.

We introduce three main contributions: The first is that we explicitly handle the interpolation time in our model, which we also re-estimate during the training process, to cope with the particularly large variations observed in the animation domain, compared to natural videos; The second is that we adapt and generalize a diffusion scheme called ResShift recently proposed in the super-resolution community to VFI, which allows us to perform a very low number of diffusion steps (in the order of 10) to produce our estimates; The third is that we leverage the stochastic nature of the diffusion process to provide a pixel-wise estimate of the uncertainty on the interpolated frame, which could be useful to anticipate where the model may be wrong. We provide extensive comparisons with respect to state-of-the-art models and show that our model outperforms these models on animation videos.

Existing time-series captioning methods typically offer generic, domain-agnostic descriptions of time-series shapes and struggle to adapt to new domains without substantial retraining. To address these limitations, we introduce TADACap, a retrieval-based framework to generate domain-aware captions for time-series images, capable of adapting to new domains without retraining. Building on TADACap, we propose a novel retrieval strategy that retrieves diverse image-caption pairs from a target domain database, namely TADACap-diverse. We benchmarked TADACap-diverse against state-of-the-art methods and ablation variants. TADACap-diverse demonstrates comparable semantic accuracy while requiring significantly less annotation effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICAIF 2024</p></details> |
| **[InternVL3: Exploring Advanced Training and Test-Time Recipes for Open-Source Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10479v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce InternVL3, a significant advancement in the InternVL series featuring a native multimodal pre-training paradigm. Rather than adapting a text-only large language model (LLM) into a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that supports visual inputs, InternVL3 jointly acquires multimodal and linguistic capabilities from both diverse multimodal data and pure-text corpora during a single pre-training stage. This unified training paradigm effectively addresses the complexities and alignment challenges commonly encountered in conventional post-hoc training pipelines for MLLMs. To further improve performance and scalability, InternVL3 incorporates variable visual position encoding (V2PE) to support extended multimodal contexts, employs advanced post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed preference optimization (MPO), and adopts test-time scaling strategies alongside an optimized training infrastructure. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that InternVL3 delivers superior performance across a wide range of multi-modal tasks. In particular, InternVL3-78B achieves a score of 72.2 on the MMMU benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs. Its capabilities remain highly competitive with leading proprietary models, including ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also maintaining strong pure-language proficiency. In pursuit of open-science principles, we will publicly release both the training data and model weights to foster further research and development in next-generation MLLMs.</p></details> | Technical Report |

The time derivative terms are discretized by using the first- and second-order implicit backward difference formulas (BDF1 and BDF2) that are well suited for solving steady-state and time-dependent viscous flows at high Reynolds numbers, respectively. The nonlinear system of discrete equations at each physical timestep is solved by using a dual time-stepping technique. The proposed scheme is provably entropy-stable and positivity-preserving and provides unconditional stability properties in the physical time. Numerical results demonstrating accuracy and positivity-preserving properties of the new dual time-stepping scheme are presented for supersonic viscous flows with strong shock waves and contact discontinuities.</p></details> |  |

This they did by describing an unambiguous non-deterministic algorithm to solve Directed Graph Reachability that requires O(log^2 n) space and simultaneously runs in polynomial time. Savitch's 1970 algorithm that solves the same problem deterministically also requires O(log^2 n) space but doesn't guarantee polynomial running time and hence the trade off. We describe a new problem for which we can show a similar trade off between determinism and time. We consider a collection P of f directed paths. We show that the problem of finding reachability from one vertex to another in the union G of these path graphs via a path that switches amongst the paths in P at most k times can be solved in O(klog f+log n) space but the algorithm doesn't guarantee polynomial runtime. On the other hand, we also show that the same problem can be solved by an unambiguous non-deterministic algorithm that simultaneously runs in O(klog f+log n) space and polynomial time. Since these two algorithms are not dependent on Savitch, therefore this example sheds new light on how such a trade off between determinism and time happens in space-bounded computations and makes the phenomenon less elusive.</p></details> |  |

The model first applies STL and FFT to extract trend, seasonal, and denoised residual components, effectively filtering out high-frequency noise. The filtered residuals are then fed into a stacked LSTM to capture long-term dependencies, followed by a multi-head attention mechanism that dynamically focuses on key time steps. Experiments conducted on real-world urban air quality datasets demonstrate that FALNet consistently outperforms conventional models across standard metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$. The model shows strong adaptability in capturing sharp fluctuations during pollution peaks and non-stationary conditions. These results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of FALNet for real-time air pollution prediction, environmental risk assessment, and decision-making support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nondeterministic Polynomial-time Problem Challenge: An Ever-Scaling Reasoning Benchmark for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11239v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning is the fundamental capability of large language models (LLMs). Due to the rapid progress of LLMs, there are two main issues of current benchmarks: i) these benchmarks can be crushed in a short time (less than 1 year), and ii) these benchmarks may be easily hacked. To handle these issues, we propose the ever-scalingness for building the benchmarks which are uncrushable, unhackable, auto-verifiable and general. This paper presents Nondeterministic Polynomial-time Problem Challenge (NPPC), an ever-scaling reasoning benchmark for LLMs. Specifically, the NPPC has three main modules: i) npgym, which provides a unified interface of 25 well-known NP-complete problems and can generate any number of instances with any levels of complexities, ii) npsolver: which provides a unified interface to evaluate the problem instances with both online and offline models via APIs and local deployments, respectively, and iii) npeval: which provides the comprehensive and ready-to-use tools to analyze the performances of LLMs over different problems, the number of tokens, the aha moments, the reasoning errors and the solution errors. Extensive experiments over widely-used LLMs demonstrate: i) NPPC can successfully decrease the performances of advanced LLMs' performances to below 10%, demonstrating that NPPC is uncrushable, ii) DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and o1/o3-mini are the most powerful LLMs, where DeepSeek-R1 outperforms Claude-3.7-Sonnet and o1/o3-mini in most NP-complete problems considered, and iii) the numbers of tokens, aha moments in the advanced LLMs, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet and DeepSeek-R1, are observed first to increase and then decrease when the problem instances become more and more difficult. We believe that NPPC is the first ever-scaling reasoning benchmark, serving as the uncrushable and unhackable testbed for LLMs toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary work, 10 pages for main text</p></details> |
| **[Breaking the Pre-Planning Barrier: Adaptive Real-Time Coordination of Heterogeneous UAVs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14488v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer significant potential in dynamic, perception-intensive tasks such as search and rescue and environmental monitoring; however, their effectiveness is severely restricted by conventional pre-planned routing methods, which lack the flexibility to respond in real-time to evolving task demands, unexpected disturbances, and localized view limitations in real-world scenarios. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework named \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{G}raph \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{M}ulti-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (HGAM), uniquely designed to enable adaptive real-time coordination between mission UAVs (MUAVs) and charging UAVs (CUAVs). HGAM specifically addresses the previously unsolved challenge of enabling precise, decentralized continuous-action coordination solely based on local, heterogeneous graph-based observations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that HGAM substantially surpasses existing methods, achieving, for example, a 30\% improvement in data collection coverage and a 20\% increase in charging efficiency, providing crucial insights and foundations for the future deployment of intelligent, flexible UAV networks in complex, dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-TPT: Improving Adversarial Robustness of Vision-Language Models through Test-Time Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11195v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have gained significant popularity as foundation models, with numerous fine-tuning methods developed to enhance performance on downstream tasks. However, due to their inherent vulnerability and the common practice of selecting from a limited set of open-source models, VLMs suffer from a higher risk of adversarial attacks than traditional vision models. Existing defense techniques typically rely on adversarial fine-tuning during training, which requires labeled data and lacks of flexibility for downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose robust test-time prompt tuning (R-TPT), which mitigates the impact of adversarial attacks during the inference stage. We first reformulate the classic marginal entropy objective by eliminating the term that introduces conflicts under adversarial conditions, retaining only the pointwise entropy minimization. Furthermore, we introduce a plug-and-play reliability-based weighted ensembling strategy, which aggregates useful information from reliable augmented views to strengthen the defense. R-TPT enhances defense against adversarial attacks without requiring labeled training data while offering high flexibility for inference tasks. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks with various attacks demonstrate the effectiveness of R-TPT. The code is available in https://github.com/TomSheng21/R-TPT.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

They treat forecasting as a time-shift operation, using univariate time series for total bookings and a Bayesian Dirichlet Auto-Regressive Moving Average (B-DARMA) model to allocate bookings across trip dates based on lead time. Analysis of Airbnb data shows that this approach is interpretable, flexible, and potentially more accurate for forecasting demand across multiple time axes.</p></details> |  |
| **[C-SHAP for time series: An approach to high-level temporal explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11159v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series are ubiquitous in domains such as energy forecasting, healthcare, and industry. Using AI systems, some tasks within these domains can be efficiently handled. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to increase the reliability of AI solutions by explaining model reasoning. For time series, many XAI methods provide point- or sequence-based attribution maps. These methods explain model reasoning in terms of low-level patterns. However, they do not capture high-level patterns that may also influence model reasoning. We propose a concept-based method to provide explanations in terms of these high-level patterns. In this paper, we present C-SHAP for time series, an approach which determines the contribution of concepts to a model outcome. We provide a general definition of C-SHAP and present an example implementation using time series decomposition. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology through a use case from the energy domain.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Despite the popularity of PFs, the study of the time evolution of their estimates has received barely attention in the literature. Denoting by $(\hat{\eta}_t^N)_{t\geq 1}$ the PF estimate of $(\hat{\eta}_t)_{t\geq 1}$ and letting $\kappa\in (0,1)$, in this work we first show that for any number of particles $N$ it holds that, with probability one, we have $\|\hat{\eta}_t^N- \hat{\eta}_t\|\geq \kappa$ for infinitely many $t\geq 1$, with $\|\cdot\|$ a measure of distance between probability distributions. Considering a simple filtering problem we then provide reassuring results concerning the ability of PFs to estimate jointly a finite set $\{\hat{\eta}_t\}_{t=1}^T$ of filtering distributions by studying $\mathbb{P}(\sup_{t\in\{1,\dots,T\}}\|\hat{\eta}_t^{N}-\hat{\eta}_t\|\geq \kappa)$. Finally, on the same toy filtering problem, we prove that sequential quasi-Monte Carlo, a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo version of PF algorithms, offers greater safety guarantees than PFs in the sense that, for this algorithm, it holds that $\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\sup_{t\geq 1}\|\hat{\eta}_t^N-\hat{\eta}_t\|=0$ with probability one.</p></details> | 27 pages |

Yet, both autonomous animal-reactive flight control beyond visual line of sight and/or mission-specific individual and behaviour recognition tasks rely to some degree on this capability. In response, we introduce WildLive -- a near real-time animal detection and tracking framework for high-resolution imagery running directly onboard uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). The system performs multi-animal detection and tracking at 17fps+ for HD and 7fps+ on 4K video streams suitable for operation during higher altitude flights to minimise animal disturbance. Our system is optimised for Jetson Orin AGX onboard hardware. It integrates the efficiency of sparse optical flow tracking and mission-specific sampling with device-optimised and proven YOLO-driven object detection and segmentation techniques. Essentially, computational resource is focused onto spatio-temporal regions of high uncertainty to significantly improve UAV processing speeds without domain-specific loss of accuracy. Alongside, we introduce our WildLive dataset, which comprises 200k+ annotated animal instances across 19k+ frames from 4K UAV videos collected at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. All frames contain ground truth bounding boxes, segmentation masks, as well as individual tracklets and tracking point trajectories. We compare our system against current object tracking approaches including OC-SORT, ByteTrack, and SORT. Our materials are available at: https://dat-nguyenvn.github.io/WildLive/</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Time Structure to Estimate Causal Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11076v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There exist several approaches for estimating causal effects in time series when latent confounding is present. Many of these approaches rely on additional auxiliary observed variables or time series such as instruments, negative controls or time series that satisfy the front- or backdoor criterion in certain graphs. In this paper, we present a novel approach for estimating direct (and via Wright's path rule total) causal effects in a time series setup which does not rely on additional auxiliary observed variables or time series. This approach assumes that the underlying time series is a Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) process and estimates direct causal effects by solving certain linear equation systems made up of different covariances and model parameters. We state sufficient graphical criteria in terms of the so-called full time graph under which these linear equations systems are uniquely solvable and under which their solutions contain the to-be-identified direct causal effects as components. We also state sufficient lag-based criteria under which the previously mentioned graphical conditions are satisfied and, thus, under which direct causal effects are identifiable. Several numerical experiments underline the correctness and applicability of our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages main paper, 25 pages Appendix, 50 pages in total, 3 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[DeNOTS: Stable Deep Neural ODEs for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08055v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural ODEs are a prominent branch of methods designed to capture the temporal evolution of complex time-stamped data. Their idea is to solve an ODE with Neural Network-defined dynamics, which take the immediate parameters of the observed system into account. However, larger integration intervals cause instability, which forces most modern methods to normalize time to $[0, 1]$. We provably stabilize these models by introducing an adaptive negative feedback mechanism. This modification allows for longer integration, which in turn implies higher expressiveness, mirroring the behaviour of increasing depth in conventional Neural Networks.Additionally, it provides intriguing theoretical properties: forgetfulness and missing-value robustness. For three open datasets, our method obtains up to 20\% improvements in downstream quality if compared to existing baselines, including State Space Models and Neural~CDEs.</p></details> |  |

Algorithms aiming at transferring knowledge from data-rich to data-scarce tasks have thus surged in popularity. However, despite their effectiveness in previous evaluations, their performance in challenging real-world applications is unclear and needs to be evaluated. This study benchmarks transfer learning and several meta-learning algorithms, including (First-Order) Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning ((FO)-MAML), Almost No Inner Loop (ANIL), and Task-Informed Meta-Learning (TIML), on the real-world EuroCropsML time series dataset, which combines farmer-reported crop data with Sentinel-2 satellite observations from Estonia, Latvia, and Portugal. Our findings indicate that MAML-based meta-learning algorithms achieve slightly higher accuracy compared to simpler transfer learning methods when applied to crop type classification tasks in Estonia after pre-training on data from Latvia. However, this improvement comes at the cost of increased computational demands and training time. Moreover, we find that the transfer of knowledge between geographically disparate regions, such as Estonia and Portugal, poses significant challenges to all investigated algorithms. These insights underscore the trade-offs between accuracy and computational resource requirements in selecting machine learning methods for real-world crop type classification tasks and highlight the difficulties of transferring knowledge between different regions of the Earth. To facilitate future research in this domain, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating transfer and meta-learning methods for crop type classification under real-world conditions.

Similarly, a noisy signal is represented by a random process. Time-frequency analysis, a subfield of signal processing, amounts to describing the temporal evolution of the frequency content of a signal. Loosely speaking, if $s$ is the audio recording of a musical piece, time-frequency analysis somehow consists in writing the musical score of the piece. Mathematically, the operation is performed through a transform $\mathcal{V}$, mapping $s \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ onto a complex-valued function $\mathcal{V}s \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ of time $t$ and angular frequency $\omega$. The squared modulus $(t, \omega) \mapsto \vert\mathcal{V}s(t,\omega)\vert^2$ of the time-frequency representation is known as the spectrogram of $s$; in the musical score analogy, a peaked spectrogram at $(t_0,\omega_0)$ corresponds to a musical note at angular frequency $\omega_0$ localized at time $t_0$. More generally, the intuition is that upper level sets of the spectrogram contain relevant information about in the original signal. Hence, many signal processing algorithms revolve around identifying maxima of the spectrogram. In contrast, zeros of the spectrogram indicate perfect silence, that is, a time at which a particular frequency is absent. Assimilating $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{C}$ through $z = \omega + \mathrm{i}t$, this chapter focuses on time-frequency transforms $\mathcal{V}$ that map signals to analytic functions. The zeros of the spectrogram of a noisy signal are then the zeros of a random analytic function, hence forming a Point Process in $\mathbb{C}$. This chapter is devoted to the study of these Point Processes, to their links with zeros of Gaussian Analytic Functions, and to designing signal detection and denoising algorithms using spatial statistics.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published as a chapter of the book "Stochastic Geometry: Percolation, Tesselations, Gaussian Fields and Point Processes"</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Multi-Scale Decomposition Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03751v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based and MLP-based methods have emerged as leading approaches in time series forecasting (TSF). While Transformer-based methods excel in capturing long-range dependencies, they suffer from high computational complexities and tend to overfit. Conversely, MLP-based methods offer computational efficiency and adeptness in modeling temporal dynamics, but they struggle with capturing complex temporal patterns effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a novel MLP-based Adaptive Multi-Scale Decomposition (AMD) framework for TSF. Our framework decomposes time series into distinct temporal patterns at multiple scales, leveraging the Multi-Scale Decomposable Mixing (MDM) block to dissect and aggregate these patterns in a residual manner. Complemented by the Dual Dependency Interaction (DDI) block and the Adaptive Multi-predictor Synthesis (AMS) block, our approach effectively models both temporal and channel dependencies and utilizes autocorrelation to refine multi-scale data integration. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our AMD framework not only overcomes the limitations of existing methods but also consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks across various datasets, showcasing superior efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/TROUBADOUR000/AMD</p></details> |  |

While current one-stage methods, which follow a DETR-style pipeline, achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with high-resolution inputs, we observe that this particularly benefits the estimation of individuals in smaller scales of the image (e.g., those far from the camera), but at the cost of significantly increased computation overhead. To address this, we introduce scale-adaptive tokens that are dynamically adjusted based on the relative scale of each individual in the image within the DETR framework. Specifically, individuals in smaller scales are processed at higher resolutions, larger ones at lower resolutions, and background regions are further distilled. These scale-adaptive tokens more efficiently encode the image features, facilitating subsequent decoding to regress the human mesh, while allowing the model to allocate computational resources more effectively and focus on more challenging cases. Experiments show that our method preserves the accuracy benefits of high-resolution processing while substantially reducing computational cost, achieving real-time inference with performance comparable to SOTA methods.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

Multi-LLM Repeated Sampling Efficiently Scales Test-Time Compute](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00762v3)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a simple, effective, and cost-efficient strategy to improve LLM performance by scaling test-time compute. Our strategy builds upon the repeated-sampling-then-voting framework, with a novel twist: incorporating multiple models, even weaker ones, to leverage their complementary strengths that potentially arise from diverse training data and paradigms. By using consistency as a signal, our strategy dynamically switches between models. Theoretical analysis highlights the efficiency and performance advantages of our strategy. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our strategy not only outperforms self-consistency and state-of-the-art multi-agent debate approaches, but also significantly reduces inference costs. Additionally, ModelSwitch requires only a few comparable LLMs to achieve optimal performance and can be extended with verification methods, demonstrating the potential of leveraging multiple LLMs in the generation-verification paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Distribution Gaps in Time Series Foundation Model Pretraining with Prototype-Guided Normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10900v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across diverse machine-learning domains through large-scale pretraining on large, diverse datasets. However, pretraining on such datasets introduces significant challenges due to substantial mismatches in data distributions, a problem particularly pronounced with time series data. In this paper, we tackle this issue by proposing a domain-aware adaptive normalization strategy within the Transformer architecture. Specifically, we replace the traditional LayerNorm with a prototype-guided dynamic normalization mechanism (ProtoNorm), where learned prototypes encapsulate distinct data distributions, and sample-to-prototype affinity determines the appropriate normalization layer. This mechanism effectively captures the heterogeneity of time series characteristics, aligning pretrained representations with downstream tasks. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional pretraining techniques across both classification and forecasting tasks, while effectively mitigating the adverse effects of distribution shifts during pretraining. Incorporating ProtoNorm is as simple as replacing a single line of code. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world time series benchmarks validate the robustness and generalizability of our approach, advancing the development of more versatile time series foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Despite its widespread use, it has only been recently that researchers have begun to actively study its finite time behavior, including the finite time bound on mean squared error and sample complexity. On the empirical side, experience replay has been a key ingredient in the success of deep RL algorithms, but its theoretical effects on RL have yet to be fully understood. In this paper, we present a simple decomposition of the Markovian noise terms and provide finite-time error bounds for TD-learning with experience replay. Specifically, under the Markovian observation model, we demonstrate that for both the averaged iterate and final iterate cases, the error term induced by a constant step-size can be effectively controlled by the size of the replay buffer and the mini-batch sampled from the experience replay buffer.</p></details> |  |

Generalizing the idea of virtual contraction analysis to time-delayed systems, we demonstrate that nonlinear time-delayed networks can be stabilized by diagonal high-gains if the input matrices possess certain generalized (column/row) diagonally dominant properties. To achieve stabilization of unknown networks, we further propose a distributed adaptive tuning rule for each individual gain function, ensuring that all closed-loop trajectories converge to the origin. The effectiveness of the proposed decentralized adaptive control is verified in a case study on epidemic spreading control in SIS networks with transmission delays.</p></details> |  |

They also preserve nuances when converting speech to text, enhancing the realism of presentation scripts and conversation or speech logs. However, current real-time captioning systems lack the capability to alter text attributes (ex. capitalization, sizes, and fonts) at the word level, hindering the accurate conveyance of speaker intent that is expressed in the tones or intonations of the speech. For example, ''YOU should do this'' tends to be considered as indicating ''You'' as the focus of the sentence, whereas ''You should do THIS'' tends to be ''This'' as the focus. This paper proposes a solution that changes the text decorations at the word level in real time. As a prototype, we developed an application that adjusts word size based on the loudness of each spoken word. Feedback from users implies that this system helped to convey the speaker's intent, offering a more engaging and accessible captioning experience.</p></details> | 3 pages, 1 figures |

Recently, as the technology advance relentlessly, smaller metal pitches and the increasing number of devices have led to greater challenges and longer turn-around-time for experienced human designers to debug timing issues from the Multi-Corner Multi-Mode (MCMM) timing reports. As a result, an efficient and intelligent methodology is highly necessary and essential for debugging timing issues and reduce the turnaround times. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise across various tasks in language understanding and interactive decision-making, incorporating reasoning and actions. In this work, we propose a timing analysis agent, that is empowered by multi-LLMs task solving, and incorporates a novel hierarchical planning and solving flow to automate the analysis of timing reports from commercial tool. In addition, we build a Timing Debug Relation Graph (TDRG) that connects the reports with the relationships of debug traces from experienced timing engineers. The timing analysis agent employs the novel Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, that includes agent and coding to retrieve data accurately, on the developed TDRG. In our studies, the proposed timing analysis agent achieves an average 98% pass-rate on a single-report benchmark and a 90% pass-rate for multi-report benchmark from industrial designs, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

While short-to-long generations have received considerable attention, generating long texts from extremely long resources remains relatively underexplored. The primary challenge in long-to-long generation lies in effectively integrating and analyzing relevant information from extensive inputs, which remains difficult for current large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we propose LLM$\times$MapReduce-V2, a novel test-time scaling strategy designed to enhance the ability of LLMs to process extremely long inputs. Drawing inspiration from convolutional neural networks, which iteratively integrate local features into higher-level global representations, LLM$\times$MapReduce-V2 utilizes stacked convolutional scaling layers to progressively expand the understanding of input materials. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances the ability of LLMs to process long inputs and generate coherent, informative long-form articles, outperforming several representative baselines. Both LLM$\times$MapReduce-V2 and SurveyEval are publicly available at https://github.com/thunlp/LLMxMapReduce .</p></details> |  |

This raises a critical question: how should model training be modified to optimize performance under a subsequent test-time compute strategy and budget? To explore this, we focus on pass@N, a simple test-time strategy that searches for a correct answer in $N$ independent samples. We show, surprisingly, that training with cross-entropy (CE) loss can be ${\it misaligned}$ with pass@N in that pass@N accuracy ${\it decreases}$ with longer training. We explain the origins of this misalignment in terms of model overconfidence induced by CE, and experimentally verify our prediction of overconfidence as an impediment to scaling test-time compute via pass@N. Furthermore we suggest a principled, modified training loss that is better aligned to pass@N by limiting model confidence and rescuing pass@N test performance. Our algorithm demonstrates improved mathematical reasoning on MATH and MiniF2F benchmarks under several scenarios: (1) providing answers to math questions; and (2) proving theorems by searching over proof trees of varying shapes. Overall our work underscores the importance of co-designing two traditionally separate phases of LLM development: training-time protocols and test-time search and reasoning strategies.</p></details> |  |

Beyond timbre transfer, achieving controllability on para-linguistic parameters such as pitch and Speed is critical in deploying VC systems in many application scenarios. Existing studies, however, either only provide utterance-level global control or lack interpretability on the controls. In this paper, we propose ControlVC, the first neural voice conversion system that achieves time-varying controls on pitch and speed. ControlVC uses pre-trained encoders to compute pitch and linguistic embeddings from the source utterance and speaker embeddings from the target utterance. These embeddings are then concatenated and converted to speech using a vocoder. It achieves speed control through TD-PSOLA pre-processing on the source utterance, and achieves pitch control by manipulating the pitch contour before feeding it to the pitch encoder. Systematic subjective and objective evaluations are conducted to assess the speech quality and controllability. Results show that, on non-parallel and zero-shot conversion tasks, ControlVC significantly outperforms two other self-constructed baselines on speech quality, and it can successfully achieve time-varying pitch and speed control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Audio...</summary><p>Audio samples: https://bit.ly/3PsrKLJ; Code: https://github.com/MelissaChen15/control-vc</p></details> |
| **[SS4Rec: Continuous-Time Sequential Recommendation with State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08132v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation is a key area in the field of recommendation systems aiming to model user interest based on historical interaction sequences with irregular intervals. While previous recurrent neural network-based and attention-based approaches have achieved significant results, they have limitations in capturing system continuity due to the discrete characteristics. In the context of continuous-time modeling, state space model (SSM) offers a potential solution, as it can effectively capture the dynamic evolution of user interest over time. However, existing SSM-based approaches ignore the impact of irregular time intervals within historical user interactions, making it difficult to model complexed user-item transitions in sequences. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid SSM-based model called SS4Rec for continuous-time sequential recommendation. SS4Rec integrates a time-aware SSM to handle irregular time intervals and a relation-aware SSM to model contextual dependencies, enabling it to infer user interest from both temporal and sequential perspectives. In the training process, the time-aware SSM and the relation-aware SSM are discretized by variable stepsizes according to user interaction time intervals and input data, respectively. This helps capture the continuous dependency from irregular time intervals and provides time-specific personalized recommendations. Experimental studies on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of SS4Rec.</p></details> |  |

The method is fully based on the DETR paradigm and achieves end-to-end inference through iterative and progressive mechanisms to optimize contours. To improve efficiency and accuracy, we develop two novel techniques: sub-contour decoupling mechanisms and contour fine-grained distribution refinement. In the sub-contour decoupling mechanism, we propose a deformable attention-based module that adaptively selects sampling regions based on the current predicted contour, enabling more effective capturing of object boundary information. Additionally, we design a multi-stage optimization process to enhance segmentation precision by progressively refining sub-contours. The contour fine-grained distribution refinement technique aims to further improve the ability to express fine details of contours. These innovations enable Contourformer to achieve stable and precise segmentation for each instance while maintaining real-time performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Contourformer on multiple benchmark datasets, including SBD, COCO, and KINS. We conduct comprehensive evaluations and comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, showing significant improvements in both accuracy and inference speed. This work provides a new solution for contour-based instance segmentation tasks and lays a foundation for future research, with the potential to become a strong baseline method in this field.</p></details> |  |

The de facto standard for evaluating new AutoML frameworks for tabular data is the AutoML Benchmark (AMLB). AMLB proposed to evaluate AutoML frameworks using 1- and 4-hour time budgets across 104 tasks. We argue that shorter time constraints should be considered for the benchmark because of their practical value, such as when models need to be retrained with high frequency, and to make AMLB more accessible. This work considers two ways in which to reduce the overall computation used in the benchmark: smaller time constraints and the use of early stopping. We conduct evaluations of 11 AutoML frameworks on 104 tasks with different time constraints and find the relative ranking of AutoML frameworks is fairly consistent across time constraints, but that using early-stopping leads to a greater variety in model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on the Future of Machine Learning Data Practices and Repositories, ICLR 2025</p></details> |

It remains unclear, however, to what degree these two imaging modalities capture shared information about neural activity. Here, we investigate whether it is possible to predict both task-evoked and spontaneous fMRI signals of motor brain networks from EEG time-varying spectral power using interpretable models trained for individual subjects with Sparse Group Lasso regularization. Critically, we test the trained models on data acquired from each subject on a different day and obtain statistical validation by comparison with appropriate null models as well as the conventional EEG sensorimotor rhythm. We find significant prediction results in most subjects, although less frequently for resting-state compared to task-based conditions. Furthermore, we interpret the model learned parameters to understand representations of EEG-fMRI coupling in terms of predictive EEG channels, frequencies, and haemodynamic delays. In conclusion, our work provides evidence of the ability to predict fMRI motor brain activity from EEG recordings alone across different days, in both task-evoked and spontaneous conditions, with statistical significance in individual subjects. These results present great potential for translation to EEG neurofeedback applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communication-aware Hierarchical Map Compression of Time-Varying Environments for Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10751v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we develop a systematic framework for the time-sequential compression of dynamic probabilistic occupancy grids. Our approach leverages ideas from signal compression theory to formulate an optimization problem that searches for a multi-resolution hierarchical encoder that balances the quality of the compressed map (distortion) with its description size, the latter of which relates to the bandwidth required to reliably transmit the map to other agents or to store map estimates in on-board memory. The resulting optimization problem allows for multi-resolution map compressions to be obtained that satisfy available communication or memory resources, and does not require knowledge of the occupancy map dynamics. We develop an algorithm to solve our problem, and demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework in simulation on both static (i.e., non-time varying) and dynamic (time-varying) occupancy maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Real-Time, Auto-Regression Method for In-Situ Feature Extraction in Hydrodynamics Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10632v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hydrodynamics simulations are powerful tools for studying fluid behavior under physical forces, enabling extraction of features that reveal key flow characteristics. Traditional post-analysis methods offer high accuracy but incur significant computational and I/O costs. In contrast, in-situ methods reduce data movement by analyzing data during the simulation, yet often compromise either accuracy or performance. We propose a lightweight auto-regression algorithm for real-time in-situ feature extraction. It applies curve-fitting to temporal and spatial data, reducing data volume and minimizing simulation overhead. The model is trained incrementally using mini-batches, ensuring responsiveness and low computational cost. To facilitate adoption, we provide a flexible library with simple APIs for easy integration into existing workflows. We evaluate the method on simulations of material deformation and white dwarf (WD) mergers, extracting features such as shock propagation and delay-time distribution. Results show high accuracy (94.44%-99.60%) and low performance impact (0.11%-4.95%) demonstrating the method's effectiveness for accurate and efficient in-situ analysis.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce SHIELD: a metric acquisition framework leveraging low-level filesystem monitoring and Network Block Device (NBD) technology to provide off-host, tamper-proof measurements for continuous observation of disk activity exhibited by software executing on a target device. We employ Shield within a detection architecture leveraging deep filesystem features along with simplified metrics aggregated based on frequency of disk actions, making the metrics impervious to obfuscation while avoiding reliance on vulnerable host-based logs. We evaluate the efficacy of these metrics through extensive experiments with both binary (benign vs. malicious behavior) and multiclass (ransomware strain identification) classifiers and confirm that our metrics yield high accuracy across diverse threat profiles, including intermittent or partial encryption. In a proof-of-concept deployment, we demonstrate real-time mitigation using models trained on these metrics by halting malicious disk operations after ransomware detection with minimum file loss and memory corruption. We also show that hardware-only features collected independently of OS or network stack retain high detection effectiveness, verifying feasibility of embedding the proposed pipeline in a SATA controller ASIC or FPGA for next-generation, disk-centric defenses that combine filesystem insight with inherent off-host isolation.</p></details> |  |

Previous works utilize neural fields together with physically based rendering (PBR), to estimate geometry and disentangle appearance properties of human avatars. However, one drawback of these methods is the slow rendering speed due to the expensive Monte Carlo ray tracing. To tackle this problem, we proposed to distill the knowledge from implicit neural fields (teacher) to explicit 2D Gaussian splatting (student) representation to take advantage of the fast rasterization property of Gaussian splatting. To avoid ray-tracing, we employ the split-sum approximation for PBR appearance. We also propose novel part-wise ambient occlusion probes for shadow computation. Shadow prediction is achieved by querying these probes only once per pixel, which paves the way for real-time relighting of avatars. These techniques combined give high-quality relighting results with realistic shadow effects. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed student model achieves comparable or even better relighting results with our teacher model while being 370 times faster at inference time, achieving a 67 FPS rendering speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, Project pages: https://jzr99.github.io/DNF-Avatar/</p></details> |

Increasingly, robust multimodal matching has garnered interest in robotics, surveillance, remote sensing, and medical imaging. While traditional rely on detecting and matching spatial features, they break down when faced with noisy, misaligned, or cross-modal data. Recent deep learning methods have improved robustness through learned representations, but remain constrained by their dependence on extensive training data and computational demands. We present Flow Intelligence, a paradigm-shifting approach that moves beyond spatial features by focusing on temporal motion patterns exclusively. Instead of detecting traditional keypoints, our method extracts motion signatures from pixel blocks across consecutive frames and extract temporal motion signatures between videos. These motion-based descriptors achieve natural invariance to translation, rotation, and scale variations while remaining robust across different imaging modalities. This novel approach also requires no pretraining data, eliminates the need for spatial feature detection, enables cross-modal matching using only temporal motion, and it outperforms existing methods in challenging scenarios where traditional approaches fail. By leveraging motion rather than appearance, Flow Intelligence enables robust, real-time video feature matching in diverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541v3)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, similar to most RGBT fusion tasks, it still mainly relies on manually aligned multimodal image pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Multimodal Spatio-temporal Graph learning Network (MSGNet) for alignment-free RGBT VOD problem by leveraging the robust graph representation learning model. Specifically, we first design an Adaptive Partitioning Layer (APL) to estimate the corresponding regions of the Thermal image within the RGB image (high-resolution), achieving a preliminary inexact alignment. Then, we introduce the Spatial Sparse Graph Learning Module (S-SGLM) which employs a sparse information passing mechanism on the estimated inexact alignment to achieve reliable information interaction between different modalities. Moreover, to fully exploit the temporal cues for RGBT VOD problem, we introduce Hybrid Structured Temporal Modeling (HSTM), which involves a Temporal Sparse Graph Learning Module (T-SGLM) and Temporal Star Block (TSB). T-SGLM aims to filter out some redundant information between adjacent frames by employing the sparse aggregation mechanism on the temporal graph. Meanwhile, TSB is dedicated to achieving the complementary learning of local spatial relationships. Extensive comparative experiments conducted on both the aligned dataset VT-VOD50 and the unaligned dataset UVT-VOD2024 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. Our project will be made available on our website for free public access.</p></details> |  |

While numerous efforts have been devoted to static image scenarios, ensuring temporal coherence in video-based normal estimation remains a formidable challenge. Instead of merely augmenting existing methods with temporal components, we present NormalCrafter to leverage the inherent temporal priors of video diffusion models. To secure high-fidelity normal estimation across sequences, we propose Semantic Feature Regularization (SFR), which aligns diffusion features with semantic cues, encouraging the model to concentrate on the intrinsic semantics of the scene. Moreover, we introduce a two-stage training protocol that leverages both latent and pixel space learning to preserve spatial accuracy while maintaining long temporal context. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our method, showcasing a superior performance in generating temporally consistent normal sequences with intricate details from diverse videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, Project Page: https://normalcrafter.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Encoding Temporal Graph Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11386v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) have demonstrated significant success in dynamic graph tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Both tasks comprise transductive settings, where the model predicts links among known nodes, and in inductive settings, where it generalises learned patterns to previously unseen nodes. Existing TGN designs face a dilemma under these dual scenarios. Anonymous TGNs, which rely solely on temporal and structural information, offer strong inductive generalisation but struggle to distinguish known nodes. In contrast, non-anonymous TGNs leverage node features to excel in transductive tasks yet fail to adapt to new nodes. To address this challenge, we propose Trajectory Encoding TGN (TETGN). Our approach introduces automatically expandable node identifiers (IDs) as learnable temporal positional features and performs message passing over these IDs to capture each node's historical context. By integrating this trajectory-aware module with a standard TGN using multi-head attention, TETGN effectively balances transductive accuracy with inductive generalisation. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that TETGN significantly outperforms strong baselines on both link prediction and node classification tasks, demonstrating its ability to unify the advantages of anonymous and non-anonymous models for dynamic graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Hybrid-Rule Temporal Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11344v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) are widely used for modeling event sequences in various medical domains, such as disease onset prediction, progression analysis, and clinical decision support. Although TPPs effectively capture temporal dynamics, their lack of interpretability remains a critical challenge. Recent advancements have introduced interpretable TPPs. However, these methods fail to incorporate numerical features, thereby limiting their ability to generate precise predictions. To address this issue, we propose Hybrid-Rule Temporal Point Processes (HRTPP), a novel framework that integrates temporal logic rules with numerical features, improving both interpretability and predictive accuracy in event modeling. HRTPP comprises three key components: basic intensity for intrinsic event likelihood, rule-based intensity for structured temporal dependencies, and numerical feature intensity for dynamic probability modulation. To effectively discover valid rules, we introduce a two-phase rule mining strategy with Bayesian optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a multi-criteria assessment framework, incorporating rule validity, model fitting, and temporal predictive accuracy. Experimental results on real-world medical datasets demonstrate that HRTPP outperforms state-of-the-art interpretable TPPs in terms of predictive performance and clinical interpretability. In case studies, the rules extracted by HRTPP explain the disease progression, offering valuable contributions to medical diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

We advocate defining these seeds through Influence Propagation Paths (IPPs), which is essential for scaling up the network. Our focus lies in efficiently labeling IPPs and accurately predicting these seeds, while addressing the often-overlooked cold-start issue prevalent in temporal networks. Our strategy introduces a motif-based labeling method and a tensorized Temporal Graph Network (TGN) tailored for multi-relational temporal graphs, bolstering prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, we augment cold-start nodes with new neighbors from historical data sharing similar IPPs. The recommendation system within an online team-based gaming environment presents subtle impact on the social network, forming multi-relational (i.e., weak and strong) temporal graphs for our empirical IM study. We conduct offline experiments to assess prediction accuracy and model training efficiency, complemented by online A/B testing to validate practical network growth and the effectiveness in addressing the cold-start issue.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICWSM 2025</p></details> |

Users frequently require aggregated statistical information derived from historical sensory data within specific spatial and temporal boundaries. To address this, users submit aggregation query requests with spatial-temporal constraints to target UAVs that store the relevant data. These UAVs process and return the query results, which can be aggregated within the network during transmission to conserve energy and bandwidth-resources that are inherently limited in UAV networks. However,the dynamic topology caused by UAV mobility, coupled with these resource constraints, makes efficient in-network aggregation challenging without compromising user query delay. To the best of our knowledge, existing research has yet to adequately explore spatial-temporal range aggregation queries in the context of UAV networks. In this paper, we propose ESTA, an Efficient Spatial-Temporal range Aggregation query processing algorithm tailored for UAV networks. ESTA leverages pre-planned UAV trajectories to construct a topology change graph that models the network's evolving connectivity. It then employs an efficient shortest path algorithm to determine the minimum query response delay. Subsequently, while adhering to user-specified delay constraints, ESTA transforms the in-network aggregation process into a series of set cover problems, which are solved recursively to build a Spatial-Temporal Aggregation Tree (STAT). This tree enables the identification of an energy-efficient routing path for aggregating and delivering query results. Extensive simulations demonstrate that ESTA reduces energy consumption by more than 50% compared to a baseline algorithm, all while satisfying the required query delay.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

Temporal link prediction (TLP) refers to predicting future links in a temporally evolving graph and adds additional complexity related to the dynamic nature of graphs. State-of-the-art TLP models incorporate memory modules alongside graph neural networks to learn both the temporal mechanisms of incoming nodes and the evolving graph topology. However, memory modules only store information about nodes seen at train time, and hence such models cannot be directly transferred to entirely new graphs at test time and deployment. In this work, we study a new transfer learning task for temporal link prediction, and develop transfer-effective methods for memory-laden models. Specifically, motivated by work showing the informativeness of structural signals for the TLP task, we augment a structural mapping module to the existing TLP model architectures, which learns a mapping from graph structural (topological) features to memory embeddings. Our work paves the way for a memory-free foundation model for TLP.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

Despite its widespread use, it has only been recently that researchers have begun to actively study its finite time behavior, including the finite time bound on mean squared error and sample complexity. On the empirical side, experience replay has been a key ingredient in the success of deep RL algorithms, but its theoretical effects on RL have yet to be fully understood. In this paper, we present a simple decomposition of the Markovian noise terms and provide finite-time error bounds for TD-learning with experience replay. Specifically, under the Markovian observation model, we demonstrate that for both the averaged iterate and final iterate cases, the error term induced by a constant step-size can be effectively controlled by the size of the replay buffer and the mini-batch sampled from the experience replay buffer.</p></details> |  |

A promising approach to enhance dietary monitoring in everyday life involves automated detection of food intake gestures. This study introduces a skeleton based approach using a model that combines a dilated spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) with a bidirectional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM) framework, as called ST-GCN-BiLSTM, to detect intake gestures. The skeleton-based method provides key benefits, including environmental robustness, reduced data dependency, and enhanced privacy preservation. Two datasets were employed for model validation. The OREBA dataset, which consists of laboratory-recorded videos, achieved segmental F1-scores of 86.18% and 74.84% for identifying eating and drinking gestures. Additionally, a self-collected dataset using smartphone recordings in more adaptable experimental conditions was evaluated with the model trained on OREBA, yielding F1-scores of 85.40% and 67.80% for detecting eating and drinking gestures. The results not only confirm the feasibility of utilizing skeleton data for intake gesture detection but also highlight the robustness of the proposed approach in cross-dataset validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript has been accepted in 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (IEEE EMBC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Long Video Modeling Based on Temporal Dynamic Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10443v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant breakthroughs in video understanding. However, existing models still struggle with long video processing due to the context length constraint of LLMs and the vast amount of information within the video. Although some recent methods are designed for long video understanding, they often lose crucial information during token compression and struggle with additional modality like audio. In this work, we propose a dynamic long video encoding method utilizing the temporal relationship between frames, named Temporal Dynamic Context (TDC). Firstly, we segment the video into semantically consistent scenes based on inter-frame similarities, then encode each frame into tokens using visual-audio encoders. Secondly, we propose a novel temporal context compressor to reduce the number of tokens within each segment. Specifically, we employ a query-based Transformer to aggregate video, audio, and instruction text tokens into a limited set of temporal context tokens. Finally, we feed the static frame tokens and the temporal context tokens into the LLM for video understanding. Furthermore, to handle extremely long videos, we propose a training-free chain-of-thought strategy that progressively extracts answers from multiple video segments. These intermediate answers serve as part of the reasoning process and contribute to the final answer. We conduct extensive experiments on general video understanding and audio-video understanding benchmarks, where our method demonstrates strong performance.

| **[Cumulative-Time Signal Temporal Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10325v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a widely adopted specification language in cyber-physical systems for expressing critical temporal requirements, such as safety conditions and response time. However, STL's expressivity is not sufficient to capture the cumulative duration during which a property holds within an interval of time. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Cumulative-Time Signal Temporal Logic (CT-STL) that operates over discrete-time signals and extends STL with a new cumulative-time operator. This operator compares the sum of all time steps for which its nested formula is true with a threshold. We present both a qualitative and a quantitative (robustness) semantics for CT-STL and prove both their soundness and completeness properties. We provide an efficient online monitoring algorithm for both semantics. Finally, we show the applicability of CT-STL in two case studies: specifying and monitoring cumulative temporal requirements for a microgrid and an artificial pancreas.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[STLCCP: Efficient Convex Optimization-based Framework for Signal Temporal Logic Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09441v3)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal temporal logic (STL) is a powerful formalism for specifying various temporal properties in dynamical systems. However, existing methods, such as mixed-integer programming and nonlinear programming, often struggle to efficiently solve control problems with complex, long-horizon STL specifications. This study introduces \textit{STLCCP}, a novel convex optimization-based framework that leverages key structural properties of STL: monotonicity of the robustness function, its hierarchical tree structure, and correspondence between convexity/concavity in optimizations and conjunctiveness/disjunctiveness in specifications. The framework begins with a structure-aware decomposition of STL formulas, transforming the problem into an equivalent difference of convex (DC) programs. This is then solved sequentially as a convex quadratic program using an improved version of the convex-concave procedure (CCP). To further enhance efficiency, we develop a smooth approximation of the robustness function using a function termed the \textit{mellowmin} function, specifically tailored to the proposed framework. Numerical experiments on motion planning benchmarks demonstrate that \textit{STLCCP} can efficiently handle complex scenarios over long horizons, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | 32 pages |

For instance, in bike sharing demand prediction, error patterns translate to relocation costs. However, commonly used error metrics in GeoAI evaluate predictions point-wise, neglecting effects such as spatial heterogeneity, autocorrelation, and the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem. We put forward Optimal Transport (OT) as a spatial evaluation metric and loss function. The proposed framework, called GeOT, assesses the performance of prediction models by quantifying the transport costs associated with their prediction errors. Through experiments on real and synthetic data, we demonstrate that 1) the spatial distribution of prediction errors relates to real-world costs in many applications, 2) OT captures these spatial costs more accurately than existing metrics, and 3) OT enhances comparability across spatial and temporal scales. Finally, we advocate for leveraging OT as a loss function in neural networks to improve the spatial accuracy of predictions. Experiments with bike sharing, charging station, and traffic datasets show that spatial costs are significantly reduced with only marginal changes to non-spatial error metrics. Thus, this approach not only offers a spatially explicit tool for model evaluation and selection, but also integrates spatial considerations into model training.

In today's economy, there is a stark contrast between the high demand for skilled labour and the limited employment opportunities available to those who are not adequately prepared for the digital economy. To address this critical juncture and gain a deeper and more rapid understanding of labour market dynamics, in this paper, we approach the problem of skill need forecasting as a knowledge graph (KG) completion task, specifically, temporal link prediction. We introduce our novel temporal KG constructed from online job advertisements. We then train and evaluate different temporal KG embeddings for temporal link prediction. Finally, we present predictions of demand for a selection of skills practiced by workers in the information technology industry.

| **[Air Quality Prediction with A Meteorology-Guided Modality-Decoupled Spatio-Temporal Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10014v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Air quality prediction plays a crucial role in public health and environmental protection. Accurate air quality prediction is a complex multivariate spatiotemporal problem, that involves interactions across temporal patterns, pollutant correlations, spatial station dependencies, and particularly meteorological influences that govern pollutant dispersion and chemical transformations. Existing works underestimate the critical role of atmospheric conditions in air quality prediction and neglect comprehensive meteorological data utilization, thereby impairing the modeling of dynamic interdependencies between air quality and meteorological data. To overcome this, we propose MDSTNet, an encoder-decoder framework that explicitly models air quality observations and atmospheric conditions as distinct modalities, integrating multi-pressure-level meteorological data and weather forecasts to capture atmosphere-pollution dependencies for prediction. Meantime, we construct ChinaAirNet, the first nationwide dataset combining air quality records with multi-pressure-level meteorological observations. Experimental results on ChinaAirNet demonstrate MDSTNet's superiority, substantially reducing 48-hour prediction errors by 17.54\% compared to the state-of-the-art model.

It faces a great challenge yet to be addressed - that is, the significant distributional differences among monitoring data from multiple modes make it difficult for the models to extract shared feature representations related to system health conditions. In response to this problem, this paper introduces a novel method called attention-based multiscale temporal fusion network. The multiscale depthwise convolution and gated recurrent unit are employed to extract multiscale contextual local features and long-short-term features. Instance normalization is applied to suppress mode-specific information. Furthermore, a temporal attention mechanism is designed to focus on critical time points with higher cross-mode shared information, thereby enhancing the accuracy of fault diagnosis. The proposed model is applied to Tennessee Eastman process dataset and three-phase flow facility dataset. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior diagnostic performance and maintains a small model size.

Yet, existing methods struggle with real-world challenges such as abrupt eye movements and environmental noise. Building on the efficiency of the Lightweight Spatiotemporal Network-a causal architecture optimized for edge devices-we introduce two key advancements. First, a robust data augmentation pipeline incorporating temporal shift, spatial flip, and event deletion improves model resilience, reducing Euclidean distance error by 12% (1.61 vs. 1.70 baseline) on challenging samples. Second, we propose KnightPupil, a hybrid architecture combining an EfficientNet-B3 backbone for spatial feature extraction, a bidirectional GRU for contextual temporal modeling, and a Linear Time-Varying State-Space Module to adapt to sparse inputs and noise dynamically. Evaluated on the 3ET+ benchmark, our framework achieved 1.61 Euclidean distance on the private test set of the Event-based Eye Tracking Challenge at CVPR 2025, demonstrating its effectiveness for practical deployment in AR/VR systems while providing a foundation for future innovations in neuromorphic vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for CVPRW 2025.

While current methods trained on large synthetic datasets achieve high tracking accuracy and generalize well to endoscopic scenes, their runtime performances fail to meet the low-latency requirements necessary for real-time surgical applications. To address this limitation, we propose LiteTracker, a low-latency method for tissue tracking in endoscopic video streams. LiteTracker builds on a state-of-the-art long-term point tracking method, and introduces a set of training-free runtime optimizations. These optimizations enable online, frame-by-frame tracking by leveraging a temporal memory buffer for efficient feature reuse and utilizing prior motion for accurate track initialization. LiteTracker demonstrates significant runtime improvements being around 7x faster than its predecessor and 2x than the state-of-the-art. Beyond its primary focus on efficiency, LiteTracker delivers high-accuracy tracking and occlusion prediction, performing competitively on both the STIR and SuPer datasets. We believe LiteTracker is an important step toward low-latency tissue tracking for real-time surgical applications in the operating room.</p></details> |  |

We show that the standard training objective of diffusion models, when applied with temporally consistent noise, encourages the model to be equivariant to spatial transformations in input video and noise. This enables our model to better follow motion patterns from the input video, producing aligned motion and high-fidelity frames. Furthermore, we extend our approach to 3D-consistent video generation by attaching noise as textures on 3D meshes, ensuring 3D consistency in sim-to-real applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in motion alignment, 3D consistency, and video quality while requiring only a few sampling steps in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPOT: Spatio-Temporal Pattern Mining and Optimization for Load Consolidation in Freight Transportation Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09680v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Freight consolidation has significant potential to reduce transportation costs and mitigate congestion and pollution. An effective load consolidation plan relies on carefully chosen consolidation points to ensure alignment with existing transportation management processes, such as driver scheduling, personnel planning, and terminal operations. This complexity represents a significant challenge when searching for optimal consolidation strategies. Traditional optimization-based methods provide exact solutions, but their computational complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances and they fail to leverage historical data. Machine learning-based approaches address these issues but often ignore operational constraints, leading to infeasible consolidation plans. This work proposes SPOT, an end-to-end approach that integrates the benefits of machine learning (ML) and optimization for load consolidation. The ML component plays a key role in the planning phase by identifying the consolidation points through spatio-temporal clustering and constrained frequent itemset mining, while the optimization selects the most cost-effective feasible consolidation routes for a given operational day. Extensive experiments conducted on industrial load data demonstrate that SPOT significantly reduces travel distance and transportation costs (by about 50% on large terminals) compared to the existing industry-standard load planning strategy and a neighborhood-based heuristic. Moreover, the ML component provides valuable tactical-level insights by identifying frequently recurring consolidation opportunities that guide proactive planning. In addition, SPOT is computationally efficient and can be easily scaled to accommodate large transportation networks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 3D segmentation models solely focus on spatial information. To address this gap, we propose OmniMamba4D, a novel segmentation model designed for 4D medical images (3D images over time). OmniMamba4D utilizes a spatio-temporal tetra-orientated Mamba block to effectively capture both spatial and temporal features. Unlike traditional 3D models, which analyze single-time points, OmniMamba4D processes 4D CT data, providing comprehensive spatio-temporal information on lesion progression. Evaluated on an internal dataset comprising of 3,252 CT scans, OmniMamba4D achieves a competitive Dice score of 0.682, comparable to state-of-the-arts (SOTA) models, while maintaining computational efficiency and better detecting disappeared lesions.

| **[Capturing Longitudinal Changes in Brain Morphology Using Temporally Parameterized Neural Displacement Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09514v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Longitudinal image registration enables studying temporal changes in brain morphology which is useful in applications where monitoring the growth or atrophy of specific structures is important. However this task is challenging due to; noise/artifacts in the data and quantifying small anatomical changes between sequential scans. We propose a novel longitudinal registration method that models structural changes using temporally parameterized neural displacement fields. Specifically, we implement an implicit neural representation (INR) using a multi-layer perceptron that serves as a continuous coordinate-based approximation of the deformation field at any time point. In effect, for any N scans of a particular subject, our model takes as input a 3D spatial coordinate location x, y, z and a corresponding temporal representation t and learns to describe the continuous morphology of structures for both observed and unobserved points in time. Furthermore, we leverage the analytic derivatives of the INR to derive a new regularization function that enforces monotonic rate of change in the trajectory of the voxels, which is shown to provide more biologically plausible patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on 4D brain MR registration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL)</p></details> |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we establish a novel error analysis for parametric finite element approximations of genus-1 axisymmetric mean curvature flow, formulated using two classical second-order time-stepping methods: the Crank-Nicolson method and the BDF2 method. Our results establish optimal error bounds in both the L^2-norm and H^1-norm, along with a superconvergence result in the H^1-norm for each fully discrete approximation. Finally, we perform convergence experiments to validate the theoretical findings and present numerical simulations for various genus-1 surfaces. Through a series of comparative experiments, we also demonstrate that the methods proposed in this paper exhibit significant mesh advantages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Joint Conference on Neural Networks(IJCNN), 2015</p></details> |

By preprocessing a large corpus of videos using a keyframe extraction model and deduplication technique through image hashing, our approach provides a scalable solution that significantly reduces storage requirements while maintaining high localization precision across diverse video repositories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting Sparse Movement Speed of Urban Road Networks with Nonstationary Temporal Matrix Factorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10651v3)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Movement speed data from urban road networks, computed from ridesharing vehicles or taxi trajectories, is often high-dimensional, sparse, and nonstationary (e.g., exhibiting seasonality). To address these challenges, we propose a Nonstationary Temporal Matrix Factorization (NoTMF) model that leverages matrix factorization to project high-dimensional and sparse movement speed data into low-dimensional latent spaces. This results in a concise formula with the multiplication between spatial and temporal factor matrices. To characterize the temporal correlations, NoTMF takes a latent equation on the seasonal differenced temporal factors using higher-order vector autoregression (VAR). This approach not only preserves the low-rank structure of sparse movement speed data but also maintains consistent temporal dynamics, including seasonality information. The learning process for NoTMF involves optimizing the spatial and temporal factor matrices along with a collection of VAR coefficient matrices. To solve this efficiently, we introduce an alternating minimization framework, which tackles a challenging procedure of estimating the temporal factor matrix using conjugate gradient method, as the subproblem involves both partially observed matrix factorization and seasonal differenced VAR. To evaluate the forecasting performance of NoTMF, we conduct extensive experiments on Uber movement speed datasets, which are estimated from ridesharing vehicle trajectories. These datasets contain a large proportion of missing values due to insufficient ridesharing vehicles on the urban road network. Despite the presence of missing data, NoTMF demonstrates superior forecasting accuracy and effectiveness compared to baseline models. Moreover, as the seasonality of movement speed data is of great concern, the experiment results highlight the significance of addressing the nonstationarity of movement speed data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data and Python codes: https://github.com/xinychen/tracebase</p></details> |

Despite several investigations attempting to analyze street-view images for damage estimation, they mainly focus on post-disaster images. The potential of time-series street-view images remains underexplored. Pre-disaster images provide valuable benchmarks for accurate damage estimations at building and street levels. These images could aid annotators in objectively labeling post-disaster impacts, improving the reliability of labeled data sets for model training, and potentially enhancing the model performance in damage evaluation. The goal of this study is to estimate hyperlocal, on-the-ground disaster damages using bi-temporal street-view images and advanced pre-trained vision models. Street-view images before and after 2024 Hurricane Milton in Horseshoe Beach, Florida, were collected for experiments. The objectives are: (1) to assess the performance gains of incorporating pre-disaster street-view images as a no-damage category in fine-tuning pre-trained models, including Swin Transformer and ConvNeXt, for damage level classification; (2) to design and evaluate a dual-channel algorithm that reads pair-wise pre- and post-disaster street-view images for hyperlocal damage assessment. The results indicate that incorporating pre-disaster street-view images and employing a dual-channel processing framework can significantly enhance damage assessment accuracy. The accuracy improves from 66.14% with the Swin Transformer baseline to 77.11% with the dual-channel Feature-Fusion ConvNeXt model. This research enables rapid, operational damage assessments at hyperlocal spatial resolutions, providing valuable insights to support effective decision-making in disaster management and resilience planning.</p></details> | 27 pages,9 figures |

In this context, we propose a ADHD diagnosis transformer model that can effectively simultaneously find important brain spatiotemporal biomarkers from resting-state functional magnetic resonance (rs-fMRI). This model not only learns spatiotemporal individual features but also learns the correlation with full attention structures specialized in ADHD diagnosis. In particular, it focuses on learning local blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals and distinguishing important regions of interest (ROI) in the brain. Specifically, the three proposed methods for ADHD diagnosis transformer are as follows. First, we design a CNN-based embedding block to obtain more expressive embedding features in brain region attention. It is reconstructed based on the previously CNN-based ADHD diagnosis models for the transformer. Next, for individual spatiotemporal feature attention, we change the attention method to local temporal attention and ROI-rank based masking. For the temporal features of fMRI, the local temporal attention enables to learn local BOLD signal features with only simple window masking. For the spatial feature of fMRI, ROI-rank based masking can distinguish ROIs with high correlation in ROI relationships based on attention scores, thereby providing a more specific biomarker for ADHD diagnosis. The experiment was conducted with various types of transformer models. To evaluate these models, we collected the data from 939 individuals from all sites provided by the ADHD-200 competition. Through this, the spatiotemporal enhanced transformer for ADHD diagnosis outperforms the performance of other different types of transformer variants.

The key challenge of accurate prediction is how to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and adapt to the inherent dynamics in data. Traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) often struggle with static adjacency matrices that introduce domain bias or learnable matrices that may be overfitting to specific patterns. This challenge becomes more complex when considering Multi-Task Learning (MTL). While MTL has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy through task synergies, it can also face significant hurdles due to task interference. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a novel MTL framework, Dynamic Group-wise Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task Learning (DG-STMTL). DG-STMTL proposes a hybrid adjacency matrix generation module that combines static matrices with dynamic ones through a task-specific gating mechanism. We also introduce a group-wise GCN module to enhance the modelling capability of spatio-temporal dependencies. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate our method. Results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-arts, indicating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

| **[SpaceVLLM: Endowing Multimodal Large Language Model with Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13983v3)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in either temporal or spatial localization. However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions.

| **[Unified Static and Dynamic Network: Efficient Temporal Filtering for Video Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14174v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the activity-silent and persistent activity mechanisms in human visual perception biology, we design a Unified Static and Dynamic Network (UniSDNet), to learn the semantic association between the video and text/audio queries in a cross-modal environment for efficient video grounding. For static modeling, we devise a novel residual structure (ResMLP) to boost the global comprehensive interaction between the video segments and queries, achieving more effective semantic enhancement/supplement. For dynamic modeling, we effectively exploit three characteristics of the persistent activity mechanism in our network design for a better video context comprehension. Specifically, we construct a diffusely connected video clip graph on the basis of 2D sparse temporal masking to reflect the "short-term effect" relationship. We innovatively consider the temporal distance and relevance as the joint "auxiliary evidence clues" and design a multi-kernel Temporal Gaussian Filter to expand the context clue into high-dimensional space, simulating the "complex visual perception", and then conduct element level filtering convolution operations on neighbour clip nodes in message passing stage for finally generating and ranking the candidate proposals. Our UniSDNet is applicable to both Natural Language Video Grounding (NLVG) and Spoken Language Video Grounding (SLVG) tasks. Our UniSDNet achieves SOTA performance on three widely used datasets for NLVG, as well as three datasets for SLVG, e.g., reporting new records at 38.88% R@1,IoU@0.7 on ActivityNet Captions and 40.26% R@1,IoU@0.5 on TACoS. To facilitate this field, we collect two new datasets (Charades-STA Speech and TACoS Speech) for SLVG task. Meanwhile, the inference speed of our UniSDNet is 1.56$\times$ faster than the strong multi-query benchmark.

Most of models use either independent modules to separately extract temporal and spatial correlations or joint modules to synchronously extract them, without considering the spatial-temporal correlations. Moreover, models that consider joint spatial-temporal correlations (temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal correlations) often encounter significant challenges in accuracy and computational efficiency which prevent such models from demonstrating the expected advantages of a joint spatial-temporal correlations architecture. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient pure convolutional network for traffic prediction via spatial-temporal encoding and inferring (STEI-PCN). The model introduces and designs a dynamic adjacency matrix inferring module based on absolute spatial and temporal coordinates, as well as relative spatial and temporal distance encoding, using a graph convolutional network combined with gating mechanism to capture local synchronous joint spatial-temporal correlations. Additionally, three layers of temporal dilated causal convolutional network are used to capture long-range temporal correlations. Finally, through multi-view collaborative prediction module, the model integrates the gated-activated original, local synchronous joint spatial-temporal, and long-range temporal features to achieve comprehensive prediction. This study conducts extensive experiments on flow datasets (PeMS03/04/07/08) and speed dataset (PeMS-Bay), covering multiple prediction horizons. The results show that STEI-PCN demonstrates competitive computational efficiency in both training and inference speeds, and achieves superior or slightly inferior to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on most evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Directed Temporal Tree Realization for Periodic Public Transport: Easy and Hard Cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07920v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the complexity of the directed periodic temporal graph realization problem. This work is motivated by the design of periodic schedules in public transport with constraints on the quality of service. Namely, we require that the fastest path between (important) pairs of vertices is upper bounded by a specified maximum duration, encoded in an upper distance matrix $D$. While previous work has considered the undirected version of the problem, the application in public transport schedule design requires the flexibility to assign different departure times to the two directions of an edge. A problem instance can only be feasible if all values of the distance matrix are at least shortest path distances. However, the task of realizing exact fastest path distances in a periodic temporal graph is often too restrictive. Therefore, we introduce a minimum slack parameter $k$ that describes a lower bound on the maximum allowed waiting time on each path. We concentrate on tree topologies and provide a full characterization of the complexity landscape with respect to the period $\Delta$ and the minimum slack parameter~$k$, showing a sharp threshold between NP-complete cases and cases which are always realizable. We also provide hardness results for the special case of period $\Delta = 2$ for general directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we introduce a Temporal Tensor Formalism to describe multidimensional time, define Quantum Shortcut Operators that enact near-instantaneous state transitions, and incorporate these into a supermaze topological model inspired by labyrinthine geometry and network complexity. We show how this framework can give rise to surprising effects such as anomalous thermodynamic relaxation (analogous to the Mpemba effect) in quantum systems. Theoretical implications for quantum computing (including quantum cloud networks) are discussed, and connections are drawn to established mathematical paradoxes and physical principles.</p></details> |  |

The hardness of choosing delays to meet passenger demands in temporal graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18987v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In train networks, carefully-chosen delays may be beneficial for certain passengers, who would otherwise miss some connection. Given a simple (directed or undirected) temporal graph and a set of passengers (each specifying a starting vertex, an ending vertex, and a desired arrival time), we ask whether it is possible to delay some of the edges of the temporal graph to realize all the passengers' demands. We call this problem DelayBetter (DB), and study it along with two variants: in $\delta$-DelayBetter, each delay must be of at most $\delta$; in ($\delta$-)Path DB, passengers also fully specify the vertices they should visit on their journey. On the positive side, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for Path DB and $\delta$-Path DB, and obtain as a corollary a polynomial-time algorithm for DB and $\delta$-DB on trees. We also provide an fpt algorithm for both problems parameterized by the size of the graph's Feedback Edge Set together with the number of passengers. On the negative side, we show NP-completeness of ($1$-)DB on bounded-degree temporal graphs even when the lifetime is $2$, and of ($10$-)DB on bounded-degree planar temporal graphs of lifetime $19$. Our results complement previous work studying reachability problems in temporal graphs with delaying operations. This is to our knowledge the first such problem in which the aim is to facilitate travel between specific points (as opposed to facilitating or impeding a broadcast from one or many sources).</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

In this paper we work on this topic, focusing on structured and semi-structured anonymized data. We not only develop a direct LLM pipeline, but also compare various methodologies and conduct an in-depth analysis. We identified and examined seventeen common temporal reasoning tasks in natural language, focusing on their algorithmic components. To assess LLM performance, we created the \textit{Reasoning and Answering Temporal Ability} dataset (RATA), featuring semi-structured anonymized data to ensure reliance on reasoning rather than on prior knowledge. We compared several methodologies, involving SoTA techniques such as Tree-of-Thought, self-reflexion and code execution, tuned specifically for this scenario. Our results suggest that achieving scalable and reliable solutions requires more than just standalone LLMs, highlighting the need for integrated approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

Unlike existing benchmarks focused on static image-text compositionality or isolated single-event videos, our benchmark targets alignment in continuous multi-event videos. Leveraging video-text datasets with temporally localized event captions (e.g. ActivityNet-Captions, YouCook2), we construct two compositional benchmarks, ActivityNet-Comp and YouCook2-Comp. We create challenging negative samples with subtle temporal disruptions such as reordering, action word replacement, partial captioning, and combined disruptions. These benchmarks comprehensively test models' compositional sensitivity across extended, cohesive video-text sequences. To improve model performance, we propose a hierarchical pairwise preference loss that strengthens alignment with temporally accurate pairs and gradually penalizes increasingly disrupted ones, encouraging fine-grained compositional learning. To mitigate the limited availability of densely annotated video data, we introduce a pretraining strategy that concatenates short video-caption pairs to simulate multi-event sequences. We evaluate video-text foundational models and large multimodal models (LMMs) on our benchmark, identifying both strengths and areas for improvement in compositionality. Overall, our work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and enhancing model capabilities in achieving fine-grained, temporally coherent video-text alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, project page at https://github.com/google-deepmind/video_comp</p></details> |
| **[VideoExpert: Augmented LLM for Temporal-Sensitive Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07519v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The core challenge in video understanding lies in perceiving dynamic content changes over time. However, multimodal large language models struggle with temporal-sensitive video tasks, which requires generating timestamps to mark the occurrence of specific events. Existing strategies require MLLMs to generate absolute or relative timestamps directly. We have observed that those MLLMs tend to rely more on language patterns than visual cues when generating timestamps, affecting their performance. To address this problem, we propose VideoExpert, a general-purpose MLLM suitable for several temporal-sensitive video tasks. Inspired by the expert concept, VideoExpert integrates two parallel modules: the Temporal Expert and the Spatial Expert. The Temporal Expert is responsible for modeling time sequences and performing temporal grounding. It processes high-frame-rate yet compressed tokens to capture dynamic variations in videos and includes a lightweight prediction head for precise event localization. The Spatial Expert focuses on content detail analysis and instruction following. It handles specially designed spatial tokens and language input, aiming to generate content-related responses. These two experts collaborate seamlessly via a special token, ensuring coordinated temporal grounding and content generation. Notably, the Temporal and Spatial Experts maintain independent parameter sets. By offloading temporal grounding from content generation, VideoExpert prevents text pattern biases in timestamp predictions. Moreover, we introduce a Spatial Compress module to obtain spatial tokens. This module filters and compresses patch tokens while preserving key information, delivering compact yet detail-rich input for the Spatial Expert. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the VideoExpert.</p></details> |  |

This technique is applied across domains such as healthcare, newswire, and intelligence analysis, aiding models in these areas to perform temporal reasoning and enabling human users to grasp the temporal structure of text. Transformer-based pre-trained language models have produced revolutionary advancements in natural language processing, demonstrating exceptional performance across a multitude of tasks. Despite the achievements garnered by Transformer-based approaches in temporal IE, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews on these endeavors. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by systematically summarizing and analyzing the body of work on temporal IE using Transformers while highlighting potential future research directions.</p></details> |  |

However, incorporating long histories is resource-intensive. Hence, temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) often rely on historical neighbors sampling heuristics such as uniform sampling or recent neighbors selection. These heuristics are static and fail to adapt to the underlying graph structure. We introduce FLASH, a learnable and graph-adaptive neighborhood selection mechanism that generalizes existing heuristics. FLASH integrates seamlessly into TGNNs and is trained end-to-end using a self-supervised ranking loss. We provide theoretical evidence that commonly used heuristics hinders TGNNs performance, motivating our design. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent and significant performance improvements for TGNNs equipped with FLASH.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 4 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Analysis of Temporal Dropout in Earth Observation Time Series for Regression Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06915v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing instances in time series data impose a significant challenge to deep learning models, particularly in regression tasks. In the Earth Observation field, satellite failure or cloud occlusion frequently results in missing time-steps, introducing uncertainties in the predicted output and causing a decline in predictive performance. While many studies address missing time-steps through data augmentation to improve model robustness, the uncertainty arising at the input level is commonly overlooked. To address this gap, we introduce Monte Carlo Temporal Dropout (MC-TD), a method that explicitly accounts for input-level uncertainty by randomly dropping time-steps during inference using a predefined dropout ratio, thereby simulating the effect of missing data. To bypass the need for costly searches for the optimal dropout ratio, we extend this approach with Monte Carlo Concrete Temporal Dropout (MC-ConcTD), a method that learns the optimal dropout distribution directly. Both MC-TD and MC-ConcTD are applied during inference, leveraging Monte Carlo sampling for uncertainty quantification. Experiments on three EO time-series datasets demonstrate that MC-ConcTD improves predictive performance and uncertainty calibration compared to existing approaches. Additionally, we highlight the advantages of adaptive dropout tuning over manual selection, making uncertainty quantification more robust and accessible for EO applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 2025)</p></details> |

Many classical problems on graphs can be translated to temporal graphs, and the results may differ. In this paper, we define the Temporal Edge Cover and Temporal Matching problems and show that they are NP-complete even when fixing the lifetime or when the underlying graph is a tree. We then describe two FPT algorithms, with parameters lifetime and treewidth, that solve the two problems. We also find lower bounds for the approximation of the two problems and give two approximation algorithms which match these bounds. Finally, we discuss the differences between the problems in the temporal and the static framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[STaR: Seamless Spatial-Temporal Aware Motion Retargeting with Penetration and Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06504v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion retargeting seeks to faithfully replicate the spatio-temporal motion characteristics of a source character onto a target character with a different body shape. Apart from motion semantics preservation, ensuring geometric plausibility and maintaining temporal consistency are also crucial for effective motion retargeting. However, many existing methods prioritize either geometric plausibility or temporal consistency. Neglecting geometric plausibility results in interpenetration while neglecting temporal consistency leads to motion jitter. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model for seamless Spatial-Temporal aware motion Retargeting (STaR), with penetration and consistency constraints. STaR consists of two modules: (1) a spatial module that incorporates dense shape representation and a novel limb penetration constraint to ensure geometric plausibility while preserving motion semantics, and (2) a temporal module that utilizes a temporal transformer and a novel temporal consistency constraint to predict the entire motion sequence at once while enforcing multi-level trajectory smoothness. The seamless combination of the two modules helps us achieve a good balance between the semantic, geometric, and temporal targets. Extensive experiments on the Mixamo and ScanRet datasets demonstrate that our method produces plausible and coherent motions while significantly reducing interpenetration rates compared with other approaches.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures; |
| **[A temporal scale transformer framework for precise remaining useful life prediction in fuel cells](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08803v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In exploring Predictive Health Management (PHM) strategies for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC), the Transformer model, widely used in data-driven approaches, excels in many fields but struggles with time series analysis due to its self-attention mechanism, which yields a complexity of the input sequence squared and low computational efficiency. It also faces challenges in capturing both global long-term dependencies and local details effectively. To tackle this, we propose the Temporal Scale Transformer (TSTransformer), an enhanced version of the inverted Transformer (iTransformer). Unlike traditional Transformers that treat each timestep as an input token, TSTransformer maps sequences of varying lengths into tokens at different stages for inter-sequence modeling, using attention to capture multivariate correlations and feed-forward networks (FFN) to encode sequence representations. By integrating a one-dimensional convolutional layer into the multivariate attention for multi-level scaling of K and V matrices, it improves local feature extraction, captures temporal scale characteristics, and reduces token count and computational costs. Experiments comparing TSTransformer with models like Long Short-Term Memory, iTransformer, and Transformer demonstrate its potential as a powerful tool for advancing PHM in renewable energy, effectively addressing the limitations of pure Transformer models in data-driven time series tasks.</p></details> | 7 figs, 10 pages |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches such as BM25 and Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) focus on lexical or semantic similarity but tend to neglect the temporal alignment between queries and documents, which is essential for time-sensitive tasks like temporal question answering (TQA). We propose TempRetriever, a novel extension of DPR that explicitly incorporates temporal information by embedding both the query date and document timestamp into the retrieval process. This allows retrieving passages that are not only contextually relevant but also aligned with the temporal intent of queries. We evaluate TempRetriever on two large-scale datasets ArchivalQA and ChroniclingAmericaQA demonstrating its superiority over baseline retrieval models across multiple metrics. TempRetriever achieves a 6.63\% improvement in Top-1 retrieval accuracy and a 3.79\% improvement in NDCG@10 compared to the standard DPR on ArchivalQA. Similarly, for ChroniclingAmericaQA, TempRetriever exhibits a 9.56\% improvement in Top-1 retrieval accuracy and a 4.68\% improvement in NDCG@10. We also propose a novel, time-based negative sampling strategy which further enhances retrieval performance by addressing temporal misalignment during training. Our results underline the importance of temporal aspects in dense retrieval systems and establish a new benchmark for time-aware passage retrieval.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge in FSAR is handling divergent narrative trajectories for precise video matching. While the frame- and tuple-level alignment approaches have been promising, their methods heavily rely on pre-defined and length-dependent alignment units (e.g., frames or tuples), which limits flexibility for actions of varying lengths and speeds. In this work, we introduce a novel TEmporal Alignment-free Matching (TEAM) approach, which eliminates the need for temporal units in action representation and brute-force alignment during matching. Specifically, TEAM represents each video with a fixed set of pattern tokens that capture globally discriminative clues within the video instance regardless of action length or speed, ensuring its flexibility. Furthermore, TEAM is inherently efficient, using token-wise comparisons to measure similarity between videos, unlike existing methods that rely on pairwise comparisons for temporal alignment. Additionally, we propose an adaptation process that identifies and removes common information across classes, establishing clear boundaries even between novel categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TEAM.

Traditional methods often focus only on the overall passenger volume, neglecting the interdependence between different modes within the hub. To address this limitation, we propose MM-STFlowNet, a comprehensive multi-mode prediction framework grounded in dynamic spatial-temporal graph modeling. Initially, an integrated temporal feature processing strategy is implemented using signal decomposition and convolution techniques to address data spikes and high volatility. Subsequently, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (STDGCRN) to capture detailed spatial-temporal dependencies across multiple traffic modes, enhanced by an adaptive channel attention mechanism. Finally, the self-attention mechanism is applied to incorporate various external factors, further enhancing prediction accuracy. Experiments on a real-world dataset from Guangzhounan Railway Station in China demonstrate that MM-STFlowNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly during peak periods, providing valuable insight for transportation hub management.</p></details> |  |

As a preliminary step, we present the statistical analysis of existing benchmarks and reveal the existing challenges from a decomposed perspective. To this end, we introduce SVLTA, the Synthetic Vision-Language Temporal Alignment derived via a well-designed and feasible control generation method within a simulation environment. The approach considers commonsense knowledge, manipulable action, and constrained filtering, which generates reasonable, diverse, and balanced data distributions for diagnostic evaluations.

These cyber-physical systems (CPS) introduce new vulnerabilities, requiring robust and automated intrusion detection systems (IDS) to mitigate potential threats. This study addresses key challenges in anomaly detection by leveraging time correlations in sensor data, integrating physical principles into machine learning models, and optimizing computational efficiency for edge applications. We build upon the concept of temporal differential consistency (TDC) loss to capture the dynamics of the system, ensuring meaningful relationships between dynamic states. Expanding on this foundation, we propose a hybrid autoencoder-based approach, referred to as hybrid TDC-AE, which extends TDC by incorporating both deterministic nodes and conventional statistical nodes. This hybrid structure enables the model to account for non-deterministic processes. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance while improving time to detect anomalies by 3%, outperforming the BATADAL challenge leader without requiring domain-specific knowledge, making it broadly applicable. Additionally, it maintains the computational efficiency of conventional autoencoders while reducing the number of fully connected layers, resulting in a more sustainable and efficient solution. The method demonstrates how leveraging physics-inspired consistency principles enhances anomaly detection and strengthens the resilience of cyber-physical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Flow as Time Series: Discovering Temporal Consistency and Variability for VideoQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05783v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a complex video-language task that demands a sophisticated understanding of both visual content and temporal dynamics. Traditional Transformer-style architectures, while effective in integrating multimodal data, often simplify temporal dynamics through positional encoding and fail to capture non-linear interactions within video sequences. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Trio Transformer (T3T), a novel architecture that models time consistency and time variability. The T3T integrates three key components: Temporal Smoothing (TS), Temporal Difference (TD), and Temporal Fusion (TF). The TS module employs Brownian Bridge for capturing smooth, continuous temporal transitions, while the TD module identifies and encodes significant temporal variations and abrupt changes within the video content. Subsequently, the TF module synthesizes these temporal features with textual cues, facilitating a deeper contextual understanding and response accuracy. The efficacy of the T3T is demonstrated through extensive testing on multiple VideoQA benchmark datasets. Our results underscore the importance of a nuanced approach to temporal modeling in improving the accuracy and depth of video-based question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Dynamic Embedding for Irregularly Sampled Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05768v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In several practical applications, particularly healthcare, clinical data of each patient is individually recorded in a database at irregular intervals as required. This causes a sparse and irregularly sampled time series, which makes it difficult to handle as a structured representation of the prerequisites of neural network models. We therefore propose temporal dynamic embedding (TDE), which enables neural network models to receive data that change the number of variables over time. TDE regards each time series variable as an embedding vector evolving over time, instead of a conventional fixed structured representation, which causes a critical missing problem. For each time step, TDE allows for the selective adoption and aggregation of only observed variable subsets and represents the current status of patient based on current observations. The experiment was conducted on three clinical datasets: PhysioNet 2012, MIMIC-III, and PhysioNet 2019. The TDE model performed competitively or better than the imputation-based baseline and several recent state-of-the-art methods with reduced training runtime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Temporal Audio-Visual Correlation Embedding for Audio-Driven One-Shot Talking Head Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05746v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paramount challenge in audio-driven One-shot Talking Head Animation (ADOS-THA) lies in capturing subtle imperceptible changes between adjacent video frames. Inherently, the temporal relationship of adjacent audio clips is highly correlated with that of the corresponding adjacent video frames, offering supplementary information that can be pivotal for guiding and supervising talking head animations. In this work, we propose to learn audio-visual correlations and integrate the correlations to help enhance feature representation and regularize final generation by a novel Temporal Audio-Visual Correlation Embedding (TAVCE) framework. Specifically, it first learns an audio-visual temporal correlation metric, ensuring the temporal audio relationships of adjacent clips are aligned with the temporal visual relationships of corresponding adjacent video frames. Since the temporal audio relationship contains aligned information about the visual frame, we first integrate it to guide learning more representative features via a simple yet effective channel attention mechanism. During training, we also use the alignment correlations as an additional objective to supervise generating visual frames. We conduct extensive experiments on several publicly available benchmarks (i.e., HDTF, LRW, VoxCeleb1, and VoxCeleb2) to demonstrate its superiority over existing leading algorithms.</p></details> | Accepted at TMM 2025 |

Furthermore, the matching module explicitly models object motion, enabling the tracking of specific targets and advancing motion understanding in complex scenarios. Recently, the proposed representation of pointmap in DUSt3R suggests a potential solution to unify both geometry estimation and matching in 3D space, but it still struggles with ambiguous matching in dynamic regions, which may hamper further improvement. In this work, we present POMATO, a unified framework for dynamic 3D reconstruction by marrying pointmap matching with temporal motion. Specifically, our method first learns an explicit matching relationship by mapping RGB pixels from both dynamic and static regions across different views to 3D pointmaps within a unified coordinate system. Furthermore, we introduce a temporal motion module for dynamic motions that ensures scale consistency across different frames and enhances performance in tasks requiring both precise geometry and reliable matching, most notably 3D point tracking. We show the effectiveness of the proposed pointmap matching and temporal fusion paradigm by demonstrating the remarkable performance across multiple downstream tasks, including video depth estimation, 3D point tracking, and pose estimation.

Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continual Learning of Multiple Cognitive Functions with Brain-inspired Temporal Development Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05621v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cognitive functions in current artificial intelligence networks are tied to the exponential increase in network scale, whereas the human brain can continuously learn hundreds of cognitive functions with remarkably low energy consumption. This advantage is in part due to the brain cross-regional temporal development mechanisms, where the progressive formation, reorganization, and pruning of connections from basic to advanced regions, facilitate knowledge transfer and prevent network redundancy. Inspired by these, we propose the Continual Learning of Multiple Cognitive Functions with Brain-inspired Temporal Development Mechanism(TD-MCL), enabling cognitive enhancement from simple to complex in Perception-Motor-Interaction(PMI) multiple cognitive task scenarios. The TD-MCL model proposes the sequential evolution of long-range connections between different cognitive modules to promote positive knowledge transfer, while using feedback-guided local connection inhibition and pruning to effectively eliminate redundancies in previous tasks, reducing energy consumption while preserving acquired knowledge. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve continual learning capabilities while reducing network scale, without introducing regularization, replay, or freezing strategies, and achieving superior accuracy on new tasks compared to direct learning. The proposed method shows that the brain's developmental mechanisms offer a valuable reference for exploring biologically plausible, low-energy enhancements of general cognitive abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[DARIS: An Oversubscribed Spatio-Temporal Scheduler for Real-Time DNN Inference on GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08795v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is limited by high computational demands, especially in constrained environments. GPUs, though effective accelerators, often face underutilization and rely on coarse-grained scheduling. This paper introduces DARIS, a priority-based real-time DNN scheduler for GPUs, utilizing NVIDIA's MPS and CUDA streaming for spatial sharing, and a synchronization-based staging method for temporal partitioning. In particular, DARIS improves GPU utilization and uniquely analyzes GPU concurrency by oversubscribing computing resources. It also supports zero-delay DNN migration between GPU partitions. Experiments show DARIS improves throughput by 15% and 11.5% over batching and state-of-the-art schedulers, respectively, even without batching. All high-priority tasks meet deadlines, with low-priority tasks having under 2% deadline miss rate. High-priority response times are 33% better than those of low-priority tasks.</p></details> |  |

Ensuring that such models verify that kind of temporal properties requires to use something beyond simulation. In this work we use the model checker Uppaal to verify a class of recurrent quantitative temporal properties appearing in RT-DEVS models, even though Uppaal cannot deal in general with this kind of properties. In order to overcome these limitations we use the technique known as automata observer. Secondly, by introducing mutations to quantitative temporal properties we are able to find errors in RT-DEVS models and their implementations. A case study from the railway domain is presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural temporal logic for mechanized program verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14906v6)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanized verification of liveness properties for infinite programs with effects and nondeterminism is challenging. Existing temporal reasoning frameworks operate at the level of models such as traces and automata. Reasoning happens at a very low-level, requiring complex nested (co-)inductive proof techniques and familiarity with proof assistant mechanics (e.g., the guardedness checker). Further, reasoning at the level of models instead of program constructs creates a verification gap that loses the benefits of modularity and composition enjoyed by structural program logics such as Hoare Logic. To address this verification gap, and the lack of compositional proof techniques for temporal specifications, we propose Ticl, a new structural temporal logic. Using ticl, we encode complex (co-)inductive proof techniques as structural lemmas and focus our reasoning on variants and invariants. We show that it is possible to perform compositional proofs of general temporal properties in a proof assistant, while working at a high level of abstraction. We demonstrate the benefits of Ticl by giving mechanized proofs of safety and liveness properties for programs with scheduling, concurrent shared memory, and distributed consensus, demonstrating a low proof-to-code ratio.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entropy Rate Maximization of Markov Decision Processes under Linear Temporal Logic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12805v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the problem of synthesizing optimal control policies for Markov decision processes (MDPs) with both qualitative and quantitative objectives. Specifically, our goal is to achieve a given linear temporal logic (LTL) task with probability one, while maximizing the \emph{entropy rate} of the system. The notion of entropy rate characterizes the long-run average (un)predictability of a stochastic process. Such an optimal policy is of our interest, in particular, from the security point of view, as it not only ensures the completion of tasks, but also maximizes the unpredictability of the system. However, existing works only focus on maximizing the total entropy which may diverge to infinity for infinite horizon. In this paper, we provide a complete solution to the entropy rate maximization problem under LTL constraints. Specifically, we first present an algorithm for synthesizing entropy rate maximizing policies for communicating MDPs. Then based on a new state classification method, we show the entropy rate maximization problem under LTL task can be effectively solved in polynomial-time. We illustrate the proposed algorithm based on two case studies of robot task planning scenario.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Reason Over Time: Timeline Self-Reflection for Improved Temporal Reasoning in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05258v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating coherent text, understanding context, and performing reasoning tasks. However, they struggle with temporal reasoning, which requires processing time-related information such as event sequencing, durations, and inter-temporal relationships. These capabilities are critical for applications including question answering, scheduling, and historical analysis. In this paper, we introduce TISER, a novel framework that enhances the temporal reasoning abilities of LLMs through a multi-stage process that combines timeline construction with iterative self-reflection. Our approach leverages test-time scaling to extend the length of reasoning traces, enabling models to capture complex temporal dependencies more effectively. This strategy not only boosts reasoning accuracy but also improves the traceability of the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including out-of-distribution test sets, and reveal that TISER enables smaller open-source models to surpass larger closed-weight models on challenging temporal reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

Current 4D representation learning techniques typically engage in iterative processing coupled with dense query operations. Although effective in capturing temporal features, this approach leads to substantial computational redundancy. In this work, we propose a framework, named as PvNeXt, for effective yet efficient point cloud video recognition, via personalized one-shot query operation. Specially, PvNeXt consists of two key modules, the Motion Imitator and the Single-Step Motion Encoder. The former module, the Motion Imitator, is designed to capture the temporal dynamics inherent in sequences of point clouds, thus generating the virtual motion corresponding to each frame. The Single-Step Motion Encoder performs a one-step query operation, associating point cloud of each frame with its corresponding virtual motion frame, thereby extracting motion cues from point cloud sequences and capturing temporal dynamics across the entire sequence. Through the integration of these two modules, {PvNeXt} enables personalized one-shot queries for each frame, effectively eliminating the need for frame-specific looping and intensive query processes. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[AsyReC: A Multimodal Graph-based Framework for Spatio-Temporal Asymmetric Dyadic Relationship Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05030v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dyadic social relationships, which refer to relationships between two individuals who know each other through repeated interactions (or not), are shaped by shared spatial and temporal experiences. Current computational methods for modeling these relationships face three major challenges: (1) the failure to model asymmetric relationships, e.g., one individual may perceive the other as a friend while the other perceives them as an acquaintance, (2) the disruption of continuous interactions by discrete frame sampling, which segments the temporal continuity of interaction in real-world scenarios, and (3) the limitation to consider periodic behavioral cues, such as rhythmic vocalizations or recurrent gestures, which are crucial for inferring the evolution of dyadic relationships. To address these challenges, we propose AsyReC, a multimodal graph-based framework for asymmetric dyadic relationship classification, with three core innovations: (i) a triplet graph neural network with node-edge dual attention that dynamically weights multimodal cues to capture interaction asymmetries (addressing challenge 1); (ii) a clip-level relationship learning architecture that preserves temporal continuity, enabling fine-grained modeling of real-world interaction dynamics (addressing challenge 2); and (iii) a periodic temporal encoder that projects time indices onto sine/cosine waveforms to model recurrent behavioral patterns (addressing challenge 3). Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, while ablation studies validate the critical role of asymmetric interaction modeling and periodic temporal encoding in improving the robustness of dyadic relationship classification in real-world scenarios. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tw-repository/AsyReC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Temporal Prompting All We Need For Limited Labeled Action Recognition?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01890v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video understanding has shown remarkable improvements in recent years, largely dependent on the availability of large scaled labeled datasets. Recent advancements in visual-language models, especially based on contrastive pretraining, have shown remarkable generalization in zero-shot tasks, helping to overcome this dependence on labeled datasets. Adaptations of such models for videos, typically involve modifying the architecture of vision-language models to cater to video data. However, this is not trivial, since such adaptations are mostly computationally intensive and struggle with temporal modeling. We present TP-CLIP, an adaptation of CLIP that leverages temporal visual prompting for temporal adaptation without modifying the core CLIP architecture. This preserves its generalization abilities. TP-CLIP efficiently integrates into the CLIP architecture, leveraging its pre-trained capabilities for video data. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate its efficacy in zero-shot and few-shot learning, outperforming existing approaches with fewer parameters and computational efficiency. In particular, we use just 1/3 the GFLOPs and 1/28 the number of tuneable parameters in comparison to recent state-of-the-art and still outperform it by up to 15.8% depending on the task and dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR-W 2025</p></details> |

This paper proposes ME-rPPG, a memory-efficient algorithm built on temporal-spatial state space duality, which resolves the trilemma of model scalability, cross-dataset generalization, and real-time constraints. Leveraging a transferable state space, ME-rPPG efficiently captures subtle periodic variations across facial frames while maintaining minimal computational overhead, enabling training on extended video sequences and supporting low-latency inference. Achieving cross-dataset MAEs of 5.38 (MMPD), 0.70 (VitalVideo), and 0.25 (PURE), ME-rPPG outperforms all baselines with improvements ranging from 21.3% to 60.2%. Our solution enables real-time inference with only 3.6 MB memory usage and 9.46 ms latency -- surpassing existing methods by 19.5%-49.7% accuracy and 43.2% user satisfaction gains in real-world deployments.

In this paper, we study efficient solutions to temporal graph applications using new algorithms for Incremental Minimum Spanning Trees (MST). The first contribution of this work is to formally discuss how a broad set of setting-problem combinations of temporal graph processing can be solved using incremental MST, along with their theoretical guarantees. However, to give efficient solutions for incremental MST, we observe a gap between theory and practice. While many classic data structures, such as the link-cut tree, provide strong bounds for incremental MST, their performance is limited in practice. Meanwhile, existing practical solutions used in applications do not have any non-trivial theoretical guarantees. Our second and main contribution includes new algorithms for incremental MST that are efficient both in theory and in practice. Our new data structure, the AM-tree, achieves the same theoretical bound as the link-cut tree for temporal graph processing and shows strong performance in practice. In our experiments, the AM-tree has competitive or better performance than existing practical solutions due to theoretical guarantee, and can be significantly faster than the link-cut tree (7.8-11x in update and 7.7-13.7x in query).</p></details> |  |

Given available disturbance datasets, we leverage conformal prediction (CP) to address the underlying chance-constrained multi-agent STL synthesis problem in a distribution-free manner. By introducing nonconformity scores as functions of prediction regions (PRs) of error trajectories, we develop an iterative PR-scaling and disturbance-feedback synthesis approach to bound training error trajectory samples. These bounds are then calibrated using a separate dataset, providing probabilistic guarantees via CP. Subsequently, we relax the underlying stochastic optimal control problem by tightening the robustness functions of collaborative tasks based on their Lipschitz constants and the computed error bounds. To address scalability, we exploit the compositional structure of the multi-agent STL formula and propose a model-predictive-control-like algorithm, where agent-level problems are solved in a distributed fashion. Lastly, we showcase the benefits of the proposed method in comparison with [1] via an illustrative example.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, submitted to CDC2025</p></details> |

In this work, we revisit temporal search paradigms for long-form video understanding and address a fundamental issue pertaining to all state-of-the-art (SOTA) long-context vision-language models (VLMs). Our contributions are twofold: First, we frame temporal search as a Long Video Haystack problem: finding a minimal set of relevant frames (e.g., one to five) from tens of thousands based on specific queries. Upon this formulation, we introduce LV-Haystack, the first dataset with 480 hours of videos, 15,092 human-annotated instances for both training and evaluation aiming to improve temporal search quality and efficiency. Results on LV-Haystack highlight a significant research gap in temporal search capabilities, with current SOTA search methods only achieving 2.1% temporal F1 score on the Longvideobench subset. Next, inspired by visual search in images, we propose a lightweight temporal search framework, T* that reframes costly temporal search as spatial search. T* leverages powerful visual localization techniques commonly used in images and introduces an adaptive zooming-in mechanism that operates across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments show that integrating T* with existing methods significantly improves SOTA long-form video understanding. Under an inference budget of 32 frames, T* improves GPT-4o's performance from 50.5% to 53.1% and LLaVA-OneVision-OV-72B's performance from 56.5% to 62.4% on the Longvideobench XL subset.

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |

The hallucination problem arises from multiple factors, including the inherent hallucinations in language models, the limitations of visual encoders in perception, and biases introduced by multimodal data. Extensive research has explored ways to mitigate hallucinations. For instance, OPERA prevents the model from overly focusing on "anchor tokens", thereby reducing hallucinations, whereas VCD mitigates hallucinations by employing a contrastive decoding approach. In this paper, we investigate the correlation between the decay of attention to image tokens and the occurrence of hallucinations. Based on this finding, we propose Temporal Attention Real-time Accumulative Connection (TARAC), a novel training-free method that dynamically accumulates and updates LVLMs' attention on image tokens during generation. By enhancing the model's attention to image tokens, TARAC mitigates hallucinations caused by the decay of attention on image tokens. We validate the effectiveness of TARAC across multiple models and datasets, demonstrating that our approach substantially mitigates hallucinations. In particular, TARAC reduces $C_S$ by 25.2 and $C_I$ by 8.7 compared to VCD on the CHAIR benchmark.</p></details> |  |

While single-vehicle perception systems encounter limitations, stemming from incomplete perception due to object occlusion and inherent blind spots, cooperative perception systems present their own challenges in terms of sensor calibration precision and positioning accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce LET-VIC, a LiDAR-based End-to-End Tracking framework for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperation (VIC). First, we employ Temporal Self-Attention and VIC Cross-Attention modules to effectively integrate temporal and spatial information from both vehicle and infrastructure perspectives. Then, we develop a novel Calibration Error Compensation (CEC) module to mitigate sensor misalignment issues and facilitate accurate feature alignment. Experiments on the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset demonstrate that LET-VIC significantly outperforms baseline models. Compared to LET-V, LET-VIC achieves +15.0% improvement in mAP and a +17.3% improvement in AMOTA. Furthermore, LET-VIC surpasses representative Tracking by Detection models, including V2VNet, FFNet, and PointPillars, with at least a +13.7% improvement in mAP and a +13.1% improvement in AMOTA without considering communication delays, showcasing its robust detection and tracking performance. The experiments demonstrate that the integration of multi-view perspectives, temporal sequences, or CEC in end-to-end training significantly improves both detection and tracking performance.

To address this, we introduce Video-3DGS, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based video refiner designed to enhance temporal consistency in zero-shot video editors. Our approach utilizes a two-stage 3D Gaussian optimizing process tailored for editing dynamic monocular videos. In the first stage, Video-3DGS employs an improved version of COLMAP, referred to as MC-COLMAP, which processes original videos using a Masked and Clipped approach. For each video clip, MC-COLMAP generates the point clouds for dynamic foreground objects and complex backgrounds. These point clouds are utilized to initialize two sets of 3D Gaussians (Frg-3DGS and Bkg-3DGS) aiming to represent foreground and background views. Both foreground and background views are then merged with a 2D learnable parameter map to reconstruct full views. In the second stage, we leverage the reconstruction ability developed in the first stage to impose the temporal constraints on the video diffusion model. To demonstrate the efficacy of Video-3DGS on both stages, we conduct extensive experiments across two related tasks: Video Reconstruction and Video Editing. Video-3DGS trained with 3k iterations significantly improves video reconstruction quality (+3 PSNR, +7 PSNR increase) and training efficiency (x1.9, x4.5 times faster) over NeRF-based and 3DGS-based state-of-art methods on DAVIS dataset, respectively. Moreover, it enhances video editing by ensuring temporal consistency across 58 dynamic monocular videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TMLR 2025.

Specifically, our work explores to provide a general representation to boost the temporal matching ability in various downstream tracking tasks. To achieve this, we firstly find that a simple extension of MAE, which randomly masks out frame patches in videos and reconstruct the frame pixels, heavily relies on spatial cues while ignoring temporal relations for frame reconstruction, thus leading to sub-optimal temporal matching representations. To alleviate this, we propose DropMAE, which adaptively performs spatial-attention dropout in the frame reconstruction to facilitate temporal correspondence learning in videos. We obtain several important findings with DropMAE: 1) DropMAE is a strong and efficient temporal matching learner, which achieves better fine-tuning results on matching-based tasks than the ImageNet-based MAE with 2x faster pre-training speed. 2) DropMAE is effective for different tracking tasks, i.e., object-level matching tasks including VOT and VOS, dense tracking tasks including optical flow estimation and tracking any point (TAP), and even 3D tracking in the different modality of point cloud data. Since none exists, we build ViT-based trackers for different downstream tracking tasks, and our pre-trained DropMAE model can be directly loaded in these ViT-based trackers for fine-tuning without further modifications. Experiments on 6 downstream tracking tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of DropMAE as a general pre-trained representation for diverse tracking tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extension of DropMAE for 6 temporal matching-based downstream tasks</p></details> |

Analyzing the set of observation video frames in ego-view has been widely used in most PCI prediction methods to forecast the cross intent. However, they struggle to capture the critical events related to pedestrian behaviour along the temporal dimension due to the high redundancy of the video frames, which results in the sub-optimal performance of PCI prediction. Our research addresses the challenge by introducing a novel approach called \underline{T}emporal-\underline{c}ontextual Event \underline{L}earning (TCL). The TCL is composed of the Temporal Merging Module (TMM), which aims to manage the redundancy by clustering the observed video frames into multiple key temporal events. Then, the Contextual Attention Block (CAB) is employed to adaptively aggregate multiple event features along with visual and non-visual data. By synthesizing the temporal feature extraction and contextual attention on the key information across the critical events, TCL can learn expressive representation for the PCI prediction. Extensive experiments are carried out on three widely adopted datasets, including PIE, JAAD-beh, and JAAD-all. The results show that TCL substantially surpasses the state-of-the-art methods.

Besides that, query denoising can be used to increase the diversity of training samples for modeling complex scenarios which is critical for Multi-Object Tracking (MOT), showing its potential in MOT application. Existing approaches integrate query denoising within the tracking-by-attention paradigm. However, as the denoising process only happens within the single frame, it cannot benefit the tracker to learn temporal-related information. In addition, the attention mask in query denoising prevents information exchange between denoising and object queries, limiting its potential in improving association using self-attention. To address these issues, we propose TQD-Track, which introduces Temporal Query Denoising (TQD) tailored for MOT, enabling denoising queries to carry temporal information and instance-specific feature representation. We introduce diverse noise types onto denoising queries that simulate real-world challenges in MOT. We analyze our proposed TQD for different tracking paradigms, and find out the paradigm with explicit learned data association module, e.g. tracking-by-detection or alternating detection and association, benefit from TQD by a larger margin. For these paradigms, we further design an association mask in the association module to ensure the consistent interaction between track and detection queries as during inference. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances different tracking methods by only changing the training process, especially the paradigms with explicit association module.</p></details> |  |

Our method uses multi-level token compression and hierarchical temporal processing to remain computationally efficient without sacrificing temporal resolution. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset from the Iowa Department of Transportation, HybridMamba achieves a mean absolute error of 1.50 seconds, with 65.2 percent of predictions within one second of the ground truth. It outperforms recent video-language models such as TimeChat and VideoLLaMA2 by up to 2.8 seconds, while using significantly fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate strong generalization across videos ranging from 2 to 40 minutes in diverse conditions. HybridMamba offers a robust and efficient solution for fine-grained temporal localization in traffic surveillance. The code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |

To overcome the lack of signal based time-varying feature problems, we propose a lightweight squeeze-excitation deep learning-based multi stream spatial temporal dynamics time-varying feature extraction approach to build an effective sEMG-based hand gesture recognition system. Each branch of the proposed model was designed to extract hierarchical features, capturing both global and detailed spatial-temporal relationships to ensure feature effectiveness. The first branch, utilizing a Bidirectional-TCN (Bi-TCN), focuses on capturing long-term temporal dependencies by modelling past and future temporal contexts, providing a holistic view of gesture dynamics. The second branch, incorporating a 1D Convolutional layer, separable CNN, and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block, efficiently extracts spatial-temporal features while emphasizing critical feature channels, enhancing feature relevance. The third branch, combining a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), captures bidirectional temporal relationships and time-varying patterns. Outputs from all branches are fused using concatenation to capture subtle variations in the data and then refined with a channel attention module, selectively focusing on the most informative features while improving computational efficiency. The proposed model was tested on the Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB5 datasets, achieving accuracy rates of 96.41%, 92.40%, and 93.34%, respectively. These results demonstrate the capability of the system to handle complex sEMG dynamics, offering advancements in prosthetic limb control and human-machine interface technologies with significant implications for assistive technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Pair Temporal Sentence Grounding via Multi-Thread Knowledge Transfer Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15678v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given some video-query pairs with untrimmed videos and sentence queries, temporal sentence grounding (TSG) aims to locate query-relevant segments in these videos. Although previous respectable TSG methods have achieved remarkable success, they train each video-query pair separately and ignore the relationship between different pairs. We observe that the similar video/query content not only helps the TSG model better understand and generalize the cross-modal representation but also assists the model in locating some complex video-query pairs. Previous methods follow a single-thread framework that cannot co-train different pairs and usually spends much time re-obtaining redundant knowledge, limiting their real-world applications. To this end, in this paper, we pose a brand-new setting: Multi-Pair TSG, which aims to co-train these pairs. In particular, we propose a novel video-query co-training approach, Multi-Thread Knowledge Transfer Network, to locate a variety of video-query pairs effectively and efficiently. Firstly, we mine the spatial and temporal semantics across different queries to cooperate with each other. To learn intra- and inter-modal representations simultaneously, we design a cross-modal contrast module to explore the semantic consistency by a self-supervised strategy. To fully align visual and textual representations between different pairs, we design a prototype alignment strategy to 1) match object prototypes and phrase prototypes for spatial alignment, and 2) align activity prototypes and sentence prototypes for temporal alignment. Finally, we develop an adaptive negative selection module to adaptively generate a threshold for cross-modal matching. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[DP-LET: An Efficient Spatio-Temporal Network Traffic Prediction Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03792v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting spatio-temporal network traffic is essential for dynamically managing computing resources in modern communication systems and minimizing energy consumption. Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[How I Warped Your Noise: a Temporally-Correlated Noise Prior for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03072v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video editing and generation methods often rely on pre-trained image-based diffusion models. During the diffusion process, however, the reliance on rudimentary noise sampling techniques that do not preserve correlations present in subsequent frames of a video is detrimental to the quality of the results. This either produces high-frequency flickering, or texture-sticking artifacts that are not amenable to post-processing. With this in mind, we propose a novel method for preserving temporal correlations in a sequence of noise samples. This approach is materialized by a novel noise representation, dubbed $\int$-noise (integral noise), that reinterprets individual noise samples as a continuously integrated noise field: pixel values do not represent discrete values, but are rather the integral of an underlying infinite-resolution noise over the pixel area. Additionally, we propose a carefully tailored transport method that uses $\int$-noise to accurately advect noise samples over a sequence of frames, maximizing the correlation between different frames while also preserving the noise properties. Our results demonstrate that the proposed $\int$-noise can be used for a variety of tasks, such as video restoration, surrogate rendering, and conditional video generation.

In complex environments, like modern 3D video games, distribution shift and stochasticity necessitate robust approaches beyond simple action replay. In this study, we apply Inverse Dynamics Models (IDM) with different encoders and policy heads to trajectory following in a modern 3D video game -- Bleeding Edge. Additionally, we investigate several future alignment strategies that address the distribution shift caused by the aleatoric uncertainty and imperfections of the agent. We measure both the trajectory deviation distance and the first significant deviation point between the reference and the agent's trajectory and show that the optimal configuration depends on the chosen setting. Our results show that in a diverse data setting, a GPT-style policy head with an encoder trained from scratch performs the best, DINOv2 encoder with the GPT-style policy head gives the best results in the low data regime, and both GPT-style and MLP-style policy heads had comparable results when pre-trained on a diverse setting and fine-tuned for a specific behaviour setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[GripMap: An Efficient, Spatially Resolved Constraint Framework for Offline and Online Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Racing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12115v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional trajectory planning approaches for autonomous vehicles often assume a fixed vehicle model that remains constant regardless of the vehicle's location. This overlooks the critical fact that the tires and the surface are the two force-transmitting partners in vehicle dynamics; while the tires stay with the vehicle, surface conditions vary with location. Recognizing these challenges, this paper presents a novel framework for spatially resolving dynamic constraints in both offline and online planning algorithms applied to autonomous racing. We introduce the GripMap concept, which provides a spatial resolution of vehicle dynamic constraints in the Frenet frame, allowing adaptation to locally varying grip conditions. This enables compensation for location-specific effects, more efficient vehicle behavior, and increased safety, unattainable with spatially invariant vehicle models. The focus is on low storage demand and quick access through perfect hashing. This framework proved advantageous in real-world applications in the presented form. Experiments inspired by autonomous racing demonstrate its effectiveness. In future work, this framework can serve as a foundational layer for developing future interpretable learning algorithms that adjust to varying grip conditions in real-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Robotic Skill Acquisition From a Suboptimal Demonstration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03131v3)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from Demonstration (LfD) has emerged as a crucial method for robots to acquire new skills. However, when given suboptimal task trajectory demonstrations with shape characteristics reflecting human preferences but subpar dynamic attributes such as slow motion, robots not only need to mimic the behaviors but also optimize the dynamic performance. In this work, we leverage optimization-based methods to search for a superior-performing trajectory whose shape is similar to that of the demonstrated trajectory. Specifically, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to quantify the difference between two trajectories and combine it with additional performance metrics, such as collision cost, to construct the cost function. Moreover, we develop a multi-policy version of the Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP), called MSTOMP, which is more stable and robust to parameter changes. To deal with the jitter in the demonstrated trajectory, we further utilize the gain-controlling method in the frequency domain to denoise the demonstration and propose a computationally more efficient metric, called Mean Square Error in the Spectrum (MSES), that measures the trajectories' differences in the frequency domain. We also theoretically highlight the connections between the time domain and the frequency domain methods. Finally, we verify our method in both simulation experiments and real-world experiments, showcasing its improved optimization performance and stability compared to existing methods.

| **[Trajectory-guided Motion Perception for Facial Expression Quality Assessment in Neurological Disorders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09530v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated facial expression quality assessment (FEQA) in neurological disorders is critical for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and improving patient care, yet effectively capturing the subtle motions and nuances of facial muscle movements remains a challenge. We propose to analyse facial landmark trajectories, a compact yet informative representation, that encodes these subtle motions from a high-level structural perspective. Hence, we introduce Trajectory-guided Motion Perception Transformer (TraMP-Former), a novel FEQA framework that fuses landmark trajectory features for fine-grained motion capture with visual semantic cues from RGB frames, ultimately regressing the combined features into a quality score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraMP-Former achieves new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with neurological disorders, including PFED5 (up by 6.51%) and an augmented Toronto NeuroFace (up by 7.62%). Our ablation studies further validate the efficiency and effectiveness of landmark trajectories in FEQA.

| **[Trajectory Encoding Temporal Graph Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11386v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) have demonstrated significant success in dynamic graph tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Both tasks comprise transductive settings, where the model predicts links among known nodes, and in inductive settings, where it generalises learned patterns to previously unseen nodes. Existing TGN designs face a dilemma under these dual scenarios. Anonymous TGNs, which rely solely on temporal and structural information, offer strong inductive generalisation but struggle to distinguish known nodes. In contrast, non-anonymous TGNs leverage node features to excel in transductive tasks yet fail to adapt to new nodes. To address this challenge, we propose Trajectory Encoding TGN (TETGN). Our approach introduces automatically expandable node identifiers (IDs) as learnable temporal positional features and performs message passing over these IDs to capture each node's historical context. By integrating this trajectory-aware module with a standard TGN using multi-head attention, TETGN effectively balances transductive accuracy with inductive generalisation. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that TETGN significantly outperforms strong baselines on both link prediction and node classification tasks, demonstrating its ability to unify the advantages of anonymous and non-anonymous models for dynamic graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[GC-GAT: Multimodal Vehicular Trajectory Prediction using Graph Goal Conditioning and Cross-context Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11150v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting future trajectories of surrounding vehicles heavily relies on what contextual information is given to a motion prediction model. The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Trajectory Embedding for Similarity Computation: When Triangle Inequality Violations in Distance Metrics Matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10933v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity is a cornerstone of trajectory data management and analysis. Traditional similarity functions often suffer from high computational complexity and a reliance on specific distance metrics, prompting a shift towards deep representation learning in Euclidean space. However, existing Euclidean-based trajectory embeddings often face challenges due to the triangle inequality constraints that do not universally hold for trajectory data. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel approach by incorporating non-Euclidean geometry, specifically hyperbolic space, into trajectory representation learning. We present the first-ever integration of hyperbolic space to resolve the inherent limitations of the triangle inequality in Euclidean embeddings. In particular, we achieve it by designing a Lorentz distance measure, which is proven to overcome triangle inequality constraints. Additionally, we design a model-agnostic framework LH-plugin to seamlessly integrate hyperbolic embeddings into existing representation learning pipelines. This includes a novel projection method optimized with the Cosh function to prevent the diminishment of distances, supported by a theoretical foundation. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic fusion distance that intelligently adapts to variations in triangle inequality constraints across different trajectory pairs, blending Lorentzian and Euclidean distances for more robust similarity calculations. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach effectively enhances the accuracy of trajectory similarity measures in state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world datasets. The LH-plugin not only addresses the triangle inequality issues but also significantly refines the precision of trajectory similarity computations, marking a substantial advancement in the field of trajectory representation learning.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

Although predicting the ego-vehicle's path is valuable for driver-assistance systems, existing methods mainly focus on external factors like other vehicles' motions, often neglecting the driver's attention and intent. To address this gap, we infer the ego-trajectory by integrating the driver's gaze and the surrounding scene. We introduce RouteFormer, a novel multimodal ego-trajectory prediction network combining GPS data, environmental context, and the driver's field-of-view, comprising first-person video and gaze fixations. We also present the Path Complexity Index (PCI), a new metric for trajectory complexity that enables a more nuanced evaluation of challenging scenarios. To tackle data scarcity and enhance diversity, we introduce GEM, a comprehensive dataset of urban driving scenarios enriched with synchronized driver field-of-view and gaze data. Extensive evaluations on GEM and DR(eye)VE demonstrate that RouteFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving notable improvements in prediction accuracy across diverse conditions. Ablation studies reveal that incorporating driver field-of-view data yields significantly better average displacement error, especially in challenging scenarios with high PCI scores, underscoring the importance of modeling driver attention.

| **[RINGO: Real-time Navigation with a Guiding Trajectory for Aerial Manipulators in Unknown Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08338v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion planning for aerial manipulators in constrained environments has typically been limited to known environments or simplified to that of multi-rotors, which leads to poor adaptability and overly conservative trajectories. This paper presents RINGO: Real-time Navigation with a Guiding Trajectory, a novel planning framework that enables aerial manipulators to navigate unknown environments in real time. The proposed method simultaneously considers the positions of both the multi-rotor and the end-effector. A pre-obtained multi-rotor trajectory serves as a guiding reference, allowing the end-effector to generate a smooth, collision-free, and workspace-compatible trajectory. Leveraging the convex hull property of B-spline curves, we theoretically guarantee that the trajectory remains within the reachable workspace. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables real-time navigation of aerial manipulators in unknown environments. The simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method generates less conservative trajectories than approaches that consider only the multi-rotor.</p></details> | 9 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Transferable text data distillation by trajectory matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09818v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of large language model (LLM), as the size of large models increases, it also brings higher training costs. There is a urgent need to minimize the data size in LLM training. Compared with data selection method, the data distillation method aims to synthesize a small number of data samples to achieve the training effect of the full data set and has better flexibility. Despite its successes in computer vision, the discreteness of text data has hitherto stymied its exploration in natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we proposed a method that involves learning pseudo prompt data based on trajectory matching and finding its nearest neighbor ID to achieve cross-architecture transfer. During the distillation process, we introduce a regularization loss to improve the robustness of our distilled data. To our best knowledge, this is the first data distillation work suitable for text generation tasks such as instruction tuning. Evaluations on two benchmarks, including ARC-Easy and MMLU instruction tuning datasets, established the superiority of our distillation approach over the SOTA data selection method LESS. Furthermore, our method demonstrates a good transferability over LLM structures (i.e., OPT to Llama).</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v4)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Enhancing Offline Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00601v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) relies on the availability and quality of training data, often requiring extensive interactions with specific environments. In many real-world scenarios, where data collection is costly and risky, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution by utilizing data collected by domain experts and searching for a batch-constrained optimal policy. This approach is further augmented by incorporating external data sources, expanding the range and diversity of data collection possibilities. However, existing offline RL methods often struggle with challenges posed by non-matching data from these external sources. In this work, we specifically address the problem of source-target domain mismatch in scenarios involving mixed datasets, characterized by a predominance of source data generated from random or suboptimal policies and a limited amount of target data generated from higher-quality policies. To tackle this problem, we introduce Transition Scoring (TS), a novel method that assigns scores to transitions based on their similarity to the target domain, and propose Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation (CLTV), which effectively leverages these transition scores to identify and prioritize high-quality trajectories through a curriculum learning approach. Our extensive experiments across various offline RL methods and MuJoCo environments, complemented by rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrate that CLTV enhances the overall performance and transferability of policies learned by offline RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |

Traditional assessment tools often fail to fully cover course content, leading to imprecise evaluations of student mastery. To tackle this problem, the study proposes a knowledge graph construction method based on large language models (LLMs), which transforms learning materials into structured data and generates personalized learning trajectory graphs by analyzing students' test data. Experimental results demonstrate that the model effectively alerts teachers to potential biases in their exam questions and tracks individual student progress. This system not only enhances the accuracy of learning assessments but also helps teachers provide timely guidance to students who are falling behind, thereby improving overall teaching strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Slit Mapping Based Spiral Tool Trajectory Planning for Ball-end Milling on Complex Freeform Surfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06310v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a spiral-based complete coverage strategy for ball-end milling on freeform surfaces, utilizing conformal slit mapping to generate milling trajectories that are more compact, smoother, and evenly distributed when machining 2D cavities with islands. This approach, an upgrade from traditional methods, extends the original algorithm to effectively address 3D perforated surface milling. Unlike conventional algorithms, the method embeds a continuous spiral trajectory within perforated surfaces without requiring cellular decomposition or additional boundaries. The proposed method addresses three primary challenges, including modifying conformal slit mapping for mesh surfaces, maintaining uniform scallop height between adjacent spiral trajectories, and optimizing the mapped origin point to ensure uniform scallop height distribution. To overcome these challenges, surface flattening techniques are incorporated into the original approach to accommodate mesh surfaces effectively. Tool path spacing is then optimized using a binary search strategy to regulate scallop height. A functional energy metric associated with scallop height uniformity is introduced for rapid evaluation of points mapped to the origin, with the minimum functional energy determined through perturbation techniques. The optimal placement of this point is identified using a modified gradient descent approach applied to the energy function. Validation on intricate surfaces, including low-quality and high-genus meshes, verifies the robustness of the algorithm. Surface milling experiments comparing this method with conventional techniques indicate a 15.63% improvement in scallop height uniformity while reducing machining time, average spindle impact, and spindle impact variance by up to 7.36%, 27.79%, and 55.98%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The r...</summary><p>The revised manuscript has improved the quality of the figures</p></details> |
| **[IMPACT: Behavioral Intention-aware Multimodal Trajectory Prediction with Adaptive Context Trimming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09103v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most prior research has focused on improving the precision of multimodal trajectory predictions, the explicit modeling of multimodal behavioral intentions (e.g., yielding, overtaking) remains relatively underexplored. This paper proposes a unified framework that jointly predicts both behavioral intentions and trajectories to enhance prediction accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. Specifically, we employ a shared context encoder for both intention and trajectory predictions, thereby reducing structural redundancy and information loss. Moreover, we address the lack of ground-truth behavioral intention labels in mainstream datasets (Waymo, Argoverse) by auto-labeling these datasets, thus advancing the community's efforts in this direction. We further introduce a vectorized occupancy prediction module that infers the probability of each map polyline being occupied by the target vehicle's future trajectory. By leveraging these intention and occupancy prediction priors, our method conducts dynamic, modality-dependent pruning of irrelevant agents and map polylines in the decoding stage, effectively reducing computational overhead and mitigating noise from non-critical elements. Our approach ranks first among LiDAR-free methods on the Waymo Motion Dataset and achieves first place on the Waymo Interactive Prediction Dataset. Remarkably, even without model ensembling, our single-model framework improves the soft mean average precision (softmAP) by 10 percent compared to the second-best method in the Waymo Interactive Prediction Leaderboard. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been successfully deployed on real vehicles, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | under review |

In this paper, we propose a novel method for trajectory synthesis by adapting the Time-Based Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (TimeVQVAE). Our approach leverages time-frequency domain processing, vector quantization, and transformer-based priors to capture both global and local dynamics in flight data. By discretizing the latent space and integrating transformer priors, the model learns long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and preserves coherence across entire flight paths. We evaluate the adapted TimeVQVAE using an extensive suite of quality, statistical, and distributional metrics, as well as a flyability assessment conducted in an open-source air traffic simulator. Results indicate that TimeVQVAE outperforms a temporal convolutional VAE baseline, generating synthetic trajectories that mirror real flight data in terms of spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and statistical properties. Furthermore, the simulator-based assessment shows that most generated trajectories maintain operational feasibility, although occasional outliers underscore the potential need for additional domain-specific constraints. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of multi-scale representation learning for capturing complex flight behaviors and demonstrate the promise of TimeVQVAE in producing representative synthetic trajectories for downstream tasks such as model training, airspace design, and air traffic forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was presented at the 25th Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS 2025), April 8--10, 2025, Brussels, Belgium</p></details> |
| **[AgentRewardBench: Evaluating Automatic Evaluations of Web Agent Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08942v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web agents enable users to perform tasks on web browsers through natural language interaction. Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations. We release the benchmark at: https://agent-reward-bench.github.io</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance Evaluation of Trajectory Tracking Controllers for a Quadruped Robot Leg](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08698v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complexities in the dynamic model of the legged robots make it necessary to utilize model-free controllers in the task of trajectory tracking. In This paper, an adaptive transpose Jacobian approach is proposed to deal with the dynamic model complexity, which utilizes an adaptive PI-algorithm to adjust the control gains. The performance of the proposed control algorithm is compared with the conventional transpose Jacobian and sliding mode control algorithms and evaluated by the root mean square of the errors and control input energy criteria. In order to appraise the effectiveness of the proposed control system, simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink software for a quadruped robot leg for semi-elliptical path tracking. The obtained results show that the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian reduces the overshoot and root mean square of the errors and at the same time, decreases the control input energy. Moreover, transpose Jacobin and adaptive transpose Jacobian are more robust to changes in initial conditions compared to the conventional sliding mode control. Furthermore, sliding mode control performs well up to 20% uncertainties in the parameters due to its model-based nature, whereas the transpose Jacobin and the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian algorithms show promising results even in higher mass uncertainties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Xplore</p></details> |

The trajectories are composed of several motion primitives, the most crucial of which is termed jerk segment. Within this contribution, the focus is put on the composition of the overall trajectories, assuming the required motion primitives to be readily available. Since the scheme considered is not time-optimal, even decreasing particular constraints can reduce the overall transition time, which is analysed in detail. This observation implies that replanning of the underlying jerk segments is required as an integral part of the motion planning scheme, further insight into which has been analysed in a complementary contribution. Although the proposed scheme is not time-optimal, it allows for significantly shorter transition times than established methods, such as zero-vibration shaping, while requiring significantly lower computational power than a fully time-optimal scheme.</p></details> |  |
| **[Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture filter for trajectory measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08421v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter for multi-target filtering based on sensor measurements that are sets of trajectories in the last two-time step window. The proposed filter, the trajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the set of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the set of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated with the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM posterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM density on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution for multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating the set of target states at the end of each time window. Additionally, the paper proposes computationally lighter alternatives to the TM-PMBM filter by deriving a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) density through Kullback-Leibler divergence minimisation in an augmented space with auxiliary variables. The performance of the proposed filters are evaluated in a simulation study.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, journal paper</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Lane Segment Perception and Topology Reasoning with Crowdsourcing Trajectory Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17161v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, recent advances in lane segment perception provide autonomous vehicles with a comprehensive understanding of driving scenarios. Moreover, incorporating prior information input into such perception model represents an effective approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy. However, utilizing diverse sources of prior information still faces three key challenges: the acquisition of high-quality prior information, alignment between prior and online perception, efficient integration. To address these issues, we investigate prior augmentation from a novel perspective of trajectory priors. In this paper, we initially extract crowdsourcing trajectory data from Argoverse2 motion forecasting dataset and encode trajectory data into rasterized heatmap and vectorized instance tokens, then we incorporate such prior information into the online mapping model through different ways. Besides, with the purpose of mitigating the misalignment between prior and online perception, we design a confidence-based fusion module that takes alignment into account during the fusion process. We conduct extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 dataset. The results indicate that our method's performance significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Adaptive Shrinkage Estimation For Personalized Deep Kernel Regression In Modeling Brain Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08840v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Longitudinal biomedical studies monitor individuals over time to capture dynamics in brain development, disease progression, and treatment effects. However, estimating trajectories of brain biomarkers is challenging due to biological variability, inconsistencies in measurement protocols (e.g., differences in MRI scanners), scarcity, and irregularity in longitudinal measurements. Herein, we introduce a novel personalized deep kernel regression framework for forecasting brain biomarkers, with application to regional volumetric measurements. Our approach integrates two key components: a population model that captures brain trajectories from a large and diverse cohort, and a subject-specific model that captures individual trajectories. To optimally combine these, we propose Adaptive Shrinkage Estimation, which effectively balances population and subject-specific models. We assess our model's performance through predictive accuracy metrics, uncertainty quantification, and validation against external clinical studies. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models -- including linear mixed effects models, generalized additive models, and deep learning methods -- demonstrates the superior predictive performance of our approach. Additionally, we apply our method to predict trajectories of composite neuroimaging biomarkers, which highlights the versatility of our approach in modeling the progression of longitudinal neuroimaging biomarkers. Furthermore, validation on three external neuroimaging studies confirms the robustness of our method across different clinical contexts. We make the code available at https://github.com/vatass/AdaptiveShrinkageDKGP.</p></details> |  |

In cinematography, Directors of Photography meticulously craft camera movements to achieve expressive and intentional framing. However, existing methods for camera trajectory generation remain limited: Traditional approaches rely on geometric optimization or handcrafted procedural systems, while recent learning-based methods often inherit structural biases or lack textual alignment, constraining creative synthesis. In this work, we introduce an auto-regressive model inspired by the expertise of Directors of Photography to generate artistic and expressive camera trajectories. We first introduce DataDoP, a large-scale multi-modal dataset containing 29K real-world shots with free-moving camera trajectories, depth maps, and detailed captions in specific movements, interaction with the scene, and directorial intent. Thanks to the comprehensive and diverse database, we further train an auto-regressive, decoder-only Transformer for high-quality, context-aware camera movement generation based on text guidance and RGBD inputs, named GenDoP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to existing methods, GenDoP offers better controllability, finer-grained trajectory adjustments, and higher motion stability. We believe our approach establishes a new standard for learning-based cinematography, paving the way for future advancements in camera control and filmmaking.

| **[Opinion dynamics and the unpredictability of opinion trajectories in an adaptive social network model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07848v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding opinion dynamics in social networks is critical for predicting social behavior and detecting polarization. Traditional approaches often rely on static snapshots of network states, which can obscure the underlying dynamics of opinion evolution. In this study, we introduce a dynamic framework that quantifies the unpredictability of opinion trajectories using the normalized Lempel-Ziv (nLZ) complexity. Our approach leverages an adaptive social network model where each node is characterized by three behavioral parameters - homophily, neophily, and social conformity - and where opinions evolve continuously according to a system of ordinary differential equations. The results reveal distinct nLZ complexity signatures for each node type: homophilic nodes exhibit consistently rising complexity, reflecting increasingly unpredictable opinion shifts that are counterintuitive given their tendency for similarity; neophilic nodes maintain low and stable complexity, suggesting that openness to novelty can, surprisingly, lead to stable opinion dynamics; and conformic nodes display a U-shaped complexity trend, transitioning from early opinion stagnation to later unpredictability. In fully heterogeneous networks, modest interaction effects emerge, with slight shifts in the unpredictability of each faction's trajectories. These findings underscore the importance of temporal analysis in uncovering hidden dynamical patterns, offering novel insights into the mechanisms underlying social adaptation and polarization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization Under Stochastic Dynamics Leveraging Maximum Mean Discrepancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19045v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses sampling-based trajectory optimization for risk-aware navigation under stochastic dynamics. Typically such approaches operate by computing $\tilde{N}$ perturbed rollouts around the nominal dynamics to estimate the collision risk associated with a sequence of control commands. We consider a setting where it is expensive to estimate risk using perturbed rollouts, for example, due to expensive collision-checks. We put forward two key contributions. First, we develop an algorithm that distills the statistical information from a larger set of rollouts to a reduced-set with sample size $N<<\tilde{N}$. Consequently, we estimate collision risk using just $N$ rollouts instead of $\tilde{N}$. Second, we formulate a novel surrogate for the collision risk that can leverage the distilled statistical information contained in the reduced-set. We formalize both algorithmic contributions using distribution embedding in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We perform extensive benchmarking to demonstrate that our MMD-based approach leads to safer trajectories at low sample regime than existing baselines using Conditional Value-at Risk (CVaR) based collision risk estimate.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Basant1861/MPC-MMD</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Swept Volume-Based Trajectory Generation for Arbitrary-Shaped Ground Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07554v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating an arbitrary-shaped ground robot safely in cluttered environments remains a challenging problem. The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Novel Diffusion Models for Multimodal 3D Hand Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07375v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting hand motion is critical for understanding human intentions and bridging the action space between human movements and robot manipulations. Existing hand trajectory prediction (HTP) methods forecast the future hand waypoints in 3D space conditioned on past egocentric observations. However, such models are only designed to accommodate 2D egocentric video inputs. There is a lack of awareness of multimodal environmental information from both 2D and 3D observations, hindering the further improvement of 3D HTP performance. In addition, these models overlook the synergy between hand movements and headset camera egomotion, either predicting hand trajectories in isolation or encoding egomotion only from past frames. To address these limitations, we propose novel diffusion models (MMTwin) for multimodal 3D hand trajectory prediction. MMTwin is designed to absorb multimodal information as input encompassing 2D RGB images, 3D point clouds, past hand waypoints, and text prompt. Besides, two latent diffusion models, the egomotion diffusion and the HTP diffusion as twins, are integrated into MMTwin to predict camera egomotion and future hand trajectories concurrently. We propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer module as the denoising model of the HTP diffusion to better fuse multimodal features. The experimental results on three publicly available datasets and our self-recorded data demonstrate that our proposed MMTwin can predict plausible future 3D hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and generalizes well to unseen environments. The code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/MMTwin.</p></details> |  |

It performs optimal controls by directly harnessing input-output (I/O) data, bypassing the process of explicit model identification that can be costly and time-consuming. However, its high computational complexity, driven by a large-scale optimization problem (typically in a higher dimension than its model-based counterpart--Model Predictive Control), hinders real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose the data-enabled neighboring extremal (DeeNE) framework, which significantly reduces computational cost while preserving control performance. DeeNE leverages first-order optimality perturbation analysis to efficiently update a precomputed nominal DeePC solution in response to changes in initial conditions and reference trajectories. We validate its effectiveness on a 7-DoF KINOVA Gen3 robotic arm, demonstrating substantial computational savings and robust, data-driven control performance.</p></details> |  |

Current methods in this space require specific architectural changes to image generation models, which limit their adaptability and scalability. In contrast to such methods, we provide a model-agnostic approach. We use intersections in diffusion trajectories, working only with the latent values. We could not obtain localized frame-wise coherence and diversity using only the intersection of trajectories. Thus, we instead use a grid-based approach. An in-context trained LLM is used to generate coherent frame-wise prompts; another is used to identify differences between frames. Based on these, we obtain a CLIP-based attention mask that controls the timing of switching the prompts for each grid cell. Earlier switching results in higher variance, while later switching results in more coherence. Therefore, our approach can ensure appropriate control between coherence and variance for the frames. Our approach results in state-of-the-art performance while being more flexible when working with diverse image-generation models. The empirical analysis using quantitative metrics and user studies confirms our model's superior temporal consistency, visual fidelity and user satisfaction, thus providing a novel way to obtain training-free, image-based text-to-video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> |

Yet, to fully realize its potential, an effective online trajectory evaluation is indispensable to ensure safety. By forecasting the future outcomes of a given trajectory, trajectory evaluation becomes much more effective. This goal can be achieved by employing a world model to capture environmental dynamics and predict future states. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end driving framework WoTE, which leverages a BEV World model to predict future BEV states for Trajectory Evaluation. The proposed BEV world model is latency-efficient compared to image-level world models and can be seamlessly supervised using off-the-shelf BEV-space traffic simulators. We validate our framework on both the NAVSIM benchmark and the closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark based on the CARLA simulator, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

However, open-loop training on the nuPlan dataset tends to cause causal confusion during closed-loop testing, and the dataset also presents a long-tail distribution of scenarios. These issues introduce challenges for imitation learning. To tackle these problems, we introduce CAFE-AD, a Cross-Scenario Adaptive Feature Enhancement for Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving method, designed to enhance feature representation across various scenario types. We develop an adaptive feature pruning module that ranks feature importance to capture the most relevant information while reducing the interference of noisy information during training. Moreover, we propose a cross-scenario feature interpolation module that enhances scenario information to introduce diversity, enabling the network to alleviate over-fitting in dominant scenarios. We evaluate our method CAFE-AD on the challenging public nuPlan Test14-Hard closed-loop simulation benchmark. The results demonstrate that CAFE-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods including rule-based and hybrid planners, and exhibits the potential in mitigating the impact of long-tail distribution within the dataset. Additionally, we further validate its effectiveness in real-world environments.

The optimization process yields an optimal control sequence that depends on the initial conditions and system parameters. However, the optimal sequence may result in undesirable behavior if the system's initial conditions and parameters are erroneous. This work presents a data-driven fuzzy controller synthesis framework that is guided by a time-optimal trajectory for multicopter tracking problems. In particular, we consider an aggressive maneuver consisting of a mid-air flip and generate a time-optimal trajectory by numerically solving the two-point boundary value problem. A fuzzy controller consisting of a stabilizing controller near hover conditions and an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) controller, trained to mimic the time-optimal aggressive trajectory, is constructed using the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MECC 2025</p></details> |

Additionally, the method accounts for the constraint that vehicles can only move in the direction of their orientation. The method is implemented as a configurable python library that also enables trajectory estimation solely based on position data. Regularization is applied to prevent extreme state variations.

Specifically, the UAV's kinematic and camera control inputs are jointly optimized over a rolling planning horizon to achieve complete 3D coverage of the object. The proposed controller incorporates ray-tracing into the planning process to simulate the propagation of light rays, thereby determining the visible parts of the object through the UAV's camera. This integration enables the generation of precise look-ahead coverage trajectories. The coverage planning problem is formulated as a rolling finite-horizon optimal control problem and solved using mixed-integer programming techniques. Extensive real-world and synthetic experiments validate the performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

Aiming at this issue, this paper investigates a differential flatness-based trajectory optimization method for fixed-wing UAVs (DFTO-FW). The customized trajectory representation is presented through differential flat characteristics analysis and polynomial parameterization, eliminating equality constraints to avoid the heavy computational burdens of solving complex dynamics. Through the design of integral performance costs and derivation of analytical gradients, the original trajectory optimization is transcribed into a lightweight, unconstrained, gradient-analytical optimization with linear time complexity to improve efficiency further. The simulation experiments illustrate the superior efficiency of the DFTO-FW, which takes sub-second CPU time (on a personal desktop) against other competitors by orders of magnitude to generate fixed-wing UAV trajectories in randomly generated obstacle environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version with minor language and formatting edits.

The proposed method is measurement-based and decomposes the voltage trajectory into two key components using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD): a residual part, which indicates delayed voltage recovery, and an oscillatory part, which captures oscillations. The residual component is critical, as it can detect activation of OELs in synchronous generators or Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) relays in inverter-based resources, potentially leading to instability within the quasisteady-state time frame. Meanwhile, the oscillatory component may indicate either a stable or unstable state in the short term. To accurately assess stability, STVSI employs an entropy-based metric to measure the proximity of the system to instability, with specific indices for short-term voltage stability based on oscillations and recovery. Simulations on the Nordic power system demonstrate that STVSI effectively identifies and categorizes voltage stability issues. Moreover, STVSI not only detects voltage stability conditions but also qualitatively assesses the extent of stability, providing a nuanced measure of stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted for publication in IEEE PESGM 2025</p></details> |

However, while MPC excels in planning and control, it lacks the capability for environmental perception, leading to failures in complex and unstructured scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce Vision-Language Model Predictive Control (VLMPC), a robotic manipulation planning framework that integrates the perception power of vision-language models (VLMs) with MPC. VLMPC utilizes a conditional action sampling module that takes a goal image or language instruction as input and leverages VLM to generate candidate action sequences. These candidates are fed into a video prediction model that simulates future frames based on the actions. In addition, we propose an enhanced variant, Traj-VLMPC, which replaces video prediction with motion trajectory generation to reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. Traj-VLMPC estimates motion dynamics conditioned on the candidate actions, offering a more efficient alternative for long-horizon tasks and real-time applications. Both VLMPC and Traj-VLMPC select the optimal action sequence using a VLM-based hierarchical cost function that captures both pixel-level and knowledge-level consistency between the current observation and the task input. We demonstrate that both approaches outperform existing state-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks and achieve excellent performance in various real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Despite recent advancements in place recognition using 2D cameras or 3D LiDAR, it remains to be seen how to use 4D radar for place recognition - an increasingly popular sensor for its robustness against adverse weather and lighting conditions. Compared to LiDAR point clouds, radar data are drastically sparser, noisier and in much lower resolution, which hampers their ability to effectively represent scenes, posing significant challenges for 4D radar-based place recognition.

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging an intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.</p></details> |  |

Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce GAMDTP, a novel graph attention-based network tailored for dynamic trajectory prediction. Specifically, we fuse the result of self attention and mamba-ssm through a gate mechanism, leveraging the strengths of both to extract features more efficiently and accurately, in each graph convolution layer. GAMDTP encodes the high-definition map(HD map) data and the agents' historical trajectory coordinates and decodes the network's output to generate the final prediction results. Additionally, recent approaches predominantly focus on dynamically fusing historical forecast results and rely on two-stage frameworks including proposal and refinement. To further enhance the performance of the two-stage frameworks we also design a scoring mechanism to evaluate the prediction quality during the proposal and refinement processes. Experiments on the Argoverse dataset demonstrates that GAMDTP achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving superior accuracy in dynamic trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |

To address chance constraints imposed on the entire stochastic trajectory, we propose a framework based on the set erosion strategy, which converts the chance constraints into safety constraints on an eroded subset of the safe set along the corresponding deterministic trajectory. The depth of erosion is captured by the probabilistic bound on the distance between the stochastic trajectory and its deterministic counterpart, for which we utilize a novel and sharp probabilistic bound developed recently. By adopting this framework, a deterministic control input sequence can be obtained, whose feasibility and performance are demonstrated through theoretical analysis. Our framework is compatible with various deterministic optimal control techniques, offering great flexibility and computational efficiency in a wide range of scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, our method provides the first scalable trajectory optimization scheme for high-dimensional stochastic systems under trajectory level chance constraints. We validate the proposed method through two numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Planning Safety Trajectories with Dual-Phase, Physics-Informed, and Transportation Knowledge-Driven Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04562v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have demonstrated strong reasoning and generalization capabilities in driving-related tasks, including scene understanding, planning, and control. However, they still face challenges in hallucinations, uncertainty, and long inference latency. While existing foundation models have general knowledge of avoiding collisions, they often lack transportation-specific safety knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LetsPi, a physics-informed, dual-phase, knowledge-driven framework for safe, human-like trajectory planning. To prevent hallucinations and minimize uncertainty, this hybrid framework integrates Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning with physics-informed social force dynamics. LetsPi leverages the LLM to analyze driving scenes and historical information, providing appropriate parameters and target destinations (goals) for the social force model, which then generates the future trajectory. Moreover, the dual-phase architecture balances reasoning and computational efficiency through its Memory Collection phase and Fast Inference phase. The Memory Collection phase leverages the physics-informed LLM to process and refine planning results through reasoning, reflection, and memory modules, storing safe, high-quality driving experiences in a memory bank. Surrogate safety measures and physics-informed prompt techniques are introduced to enhance the LLM's knowledge of transportation safety and physical force, respectively. The Fast Inference phase extracts similar driving experiences as few-shot examples for new scenarios, while simplifying input-output requirements to enable rapid trajectory planning without compromising safety. Extensive experiments using the HighD dataset demonstrate that LetsPi outperforms baseline models across five safety metrics.See PDF for project Github link.</p></details> |  |
| **[A High-Speed Time-Optimal Trajectory Generation Strategy via a Two-layer Planning Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11072v2)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion planning and trajectory generation are crucial technologies in various domains including the control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, manipulators, and rockets. However, optimization-based real-time motion planning becomes increasingly challenging due to the problem's probable non-convexity and the inherent limitations of non-linear programming algorithms. Highly nonlinear dynamics, obstacle avoidance constraints, and non-convex inputs can exacerbate these difficulties. In order to enhance the robustness and reduce the computational burden, this paper proposes a two-layer trajectory generating algorithm for intelligent ground vehicles with convex optimization methods, aiming to provide real-time guarantees for trajectory optimization and to improve the calculate speed of motion prediction. Our approach involves breaking down the original problem into small horizon-based planning cycles with fixed final times, referred to as planning cycles. Each planning cycle is then solved within a series of restricted convex sets constructed by some customized search algorithms incrementally. We rigorously establish these advantages through mathematical analysis under moderate assumptions and comprehensive experimental validations. For linear vehicle models, comparative experiments with general sequential convex programming algorithms demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method, particularly in terms of the computational efficiency in dynamic maps and the reduced final time.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Self-Supervised Learning Approach with Differentiable Optimization for UAV Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04289v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant traction across various fields, path planning in 3D environments remains a critical challenge, particularly under size, weight, and power (SWAP) constraints. Traditional modular planning systems often introduce latency and suboptimal performance due to limited information sharing and local minima issues. End-to-end learning approaches streamline the pipeline by mapping sensory observations directly to actions but require large-scale datasets, face significant sim-to-real gaps, or lack dynamical feasibility. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised UAV trajectory planning pipeline that integrates a learning-based depth perception with differentiable trajectory optimization. A 3D cost map guides UAV behavior without expert demonstrations or human labels. Additionally, we incorporate a neural network-based time allocation strategy to improve the efficiency and optimality. The system thus combines robust learning-based perception with reliable physics-based optimization for improved generalizability and interpretability. Both simulation and real-world experiments validate our approach across various environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. Our method achieves a 31.33% improvement in position tracking error and 49.37% reduction in control effort compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear second-order dynamics describe labial constriction trajectories across languages and contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08351v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the dynamics of labial constriction trajectories during the production of /b/ and /m/ in English and Mandarin. We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v6)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Sound Source Trajectories for Universal Sound Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04843v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods utilizing spatial information for sound source separation require prior knowledge of the direction of arrival (DOA) of the source or utilize estimated but imprecise localization results, which impairs the separation performance, especially when the sound sources are moving. In fact, sound source localization and separation are interconnected problems, that is, sound source localization facilitates sound separation while sound separation contributes to refined source localization. This paper proposes a method utilizing the mutual facilitation mechanism between sound source localization and separation for moving sources. The proposed method comprises three stages. The first stage is initial tracking, which tracks each sound source from the audio mixture based on the source signal envelope estimation. These tracking results may lack sufficient accuracy. The second stage involves mutual facilitation: Sound separation is conducted using preliminary sound source tracking results. Subsequently, sound source tracking is performed on the separated signals, thereby refining the tracking precision. The refined trajectories further improve separation performance. This mutual facilitation process can be iterated multiple times. In the third stage, a neural beamformer estimates precise single-channel separation results based on the refined tracking trajectories and multi-channel separation outputs. Simulation experiments conducted under reverberant conditions and with moving sound sources demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve more accurate separation based on refined tracking results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing(TASLP)</p></details> |

When humans grasp an object, appropriate trajectories naturally form in our minds to use it for specific tasks. Hand-object interaction trajectory priors can greatly benefit applications in robotics, embodied AI, augmented reality and related fields. However, synthesizing realistic and appropriate hand trajectories given a single object or hand-object interaction image is a highly ambiguous task, requiring to correctly identify the object of interest and possibly even the correct interaction among many possible alternatives. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose the SIGHT-Fusion system, consisting of a curated pipeline for extracting visual features of hand-object interaction details from egocentric videos involving object manipulation, and a diffusion-based conditional motion generation model processing the extracted features. We train our method given video data with corresponding hand trajectory annotations, without supervision in the form of action labels. For the evaluation, we establish benchmarks utilizing the first-person FPHAB and HOI4D datasets, testing our method against various baselines and using multiple metrics. We also introduce task simulators for executing the generated hand trajectories and reporting task success rates as an additional metric. Experiments show that our method generates more appropriate and realistic hand trajectories than baselines and presents promising generalization capability on unseen objects. The accuracy of the generated hand trajectories is confirmed in a physics simulation setting, showcasing the authenticity of the created sequences and their applicability in downstream uses.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajLearn: Trajectory Prediction Learning using Deep Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00184v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction aims to estimate an entity's future path using its current position and historical movement data, benefiting fields like autonomous navigation, robotics, and human movement analytics. Deep learning approaches have become key in this area, utilizing large-scale trajectory datasets to model movement patterns, but face challenges in managing complex spatial dependencies and adapting to dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce TrajLearn, a novel model for trajectory prediction that leverages generative modeling of higher-order mobility flows based on hexagonal spatial representation. TrajLearn predicts the next $k$ steps by integrating a customized beam search for exploring multiple potential paths while maintaining spatial continuity. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of TrajLearn, benchmarking it against leading state-of-the-art approaches and meaningful baselines. The results indicate that TrajLearn achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of up to ~40% across multiple real-world trajectory datasets. In addition, we evaluated different prediction horizons (i.e., various values of $k$), conducted resolution sensitivity analysis, and performed ablation studies to assess the impact of key model components. Furthermore, we developed a novel algorithm to generate mixed-resolution maps by hierarchically subdividing hexagonal regions into finer segments within a specified observation area. This approach supports selective detailing, applying finer resolution to areas of interest or high activity (e.g., urban centers) while using coarser resolution for less significant regions (e.g., rural areas), effectively reducing data storage requirements and computational overhead. We promote reproducibility and adaptability by offering complete code, data, and detailed documentation with flexible configuration options for various applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems</p></details> |
| **[Target Prediction Under Deceptive Switching Strategies via Outlier-Robust Filtering of Partially Observed Incomplete Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03502v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by a study on deception and counter-deception, this paper addresses the problem of identifying an agent's target as it seeks to reach one of two targets in a given environment. In practice, an agent may initially follow a strategy to aim at one target but decide to switch to another midway. Such a strategy can be deceptive when the counterpart only has access to imperfect observations, which include heavily corrupted sensor noise and possible outliers, making it difficult to visually identify the agent's true intent. To counter deception and identify the true target, we utilize prior knowledge of the agent's dynamics and the imprecisely observed partial trajectory of the agent's states to dynamically update the estimation of the posterior probability of whether a deceptive switch has taken place. However, existing methods in the literature have not achieved effective deception identification within a reasonable computation time. We propose a set of outlier-robust change detection methods to track relevant change-related statistics efficiently, enabling the detection of deceptive strategies in hidden nonlinear dynamics with reasonable computational effort. The performance of the proposed framework is examined for Weapon-Target Assignment (WTA) detection under deceptive strategies using random simulations in the kinematics model with external forcing.</p></details> |  |

In this method, each control input between two consecutive events is a polynomial and its coefficients are chosen to minimize the error in approximating a continuous-time control signal. We design an event-triggering rule that guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of the tracking error and non-Zeno behavior of inter-event times. We illustrate our results through a suite of numerical simulations and experiments, which indicate that the number of events generated by the proposed controller is significantly less compared to that by a time-triggered controller or a event-triggered controller based on zero-order hold while guaranteeing similar tracking performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Hamiltonian for Direct Construction of Safe Set from Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03233v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In continuous-time optimal control, evaluating the Hamiltonian requires solving a constrained optimization problem using the system's dynamics model. Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis for safety verification has demonstrated practical utility only when efficient evaluation of the Hamiltonian over a large state-time grid is possible. In this study, we introduce the concept of a data-driven Hamiltonian (DDH), which circumvents the need for an explicit dynamics model by relying only on mild prior knowledge (e.g., Lipschitz constants), thus enabling the construction of reachable sets directly from trajectory data. Recognizing that the Hamiltonian is the optimal inner product between a given costate and realizable state velocities, the DDH estimates the Hamiltonian using the worst-case realization of the velocity field based on the observed state trajectory data. This formulation ensures a conservative approximation of the true Hamiltonian for uncertain dynamics. The reachable set computed based on the DDH is also ensured to be a conservative approximation of the true reachable set. Next, we propose a data-efficient safe experiment framework for gradual expansion of safe sets using the DDH. This is achieved by iteratively conducting experiments within the computed data-driven safe set and updating the set using newly collected trajectory data. To demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, we showcase its effectiveness in safe flight envelope expansion for a tiltrotor vehicle transitioning from near-hover to forward flight.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the extended version of the article submitted to IEEE CDC 2025.

| **[Learning Lie Group Generators from Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03220v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the inverse problem of generator recovery in matrix Lie groups from discretized trajectories. Let $G$ be a real matrix Lie group and $\mathfrak{g} = \text{Lie}(G)$ its corresponding Lie algebra. A smooth trajectory $\gamma($t$)$ generated by a fixed Lie algebra element $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}$ follows the exponential flow $\gamma($t$) = g_0 \cdot \exp(t \xi)$. The central task addressed in this work is the reconstruction of such a latent generator $\xi$ from a discretized sequence of poses $ \{g_0, g_1, \dots, g_T\} \subset G$, sampled at uniform time intervals. This problem is formulated as a data-driven regression from normalized sequences of discrete Lie algebra increments $\log\left(g_{t}^{-1} g_{t+1}\right)$ to the constant generator $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}$. A feedforward neural network is trained to learn this mapping across several groups, including $\text{SE(2)}, \text{SE(3)}, \text{SO(3)}, and \text{SL(2,$\mathbb{R})$}$. It demonstrates strong empirical accuracy under both clean and noisy conditions, which validates the viability of data-driven recovery of Lie group generators using shallow neural architectures.

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quattro: Transformer-Accelerated Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator Framework for Fast Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01806v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time optimal control remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, especially for nonlinear systems with stringent performance requirements. As one of the representative trajectory optimization algorithms, the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) faces limitations due to their inherently sequential computational nature, which restricts the efficiency and applicability of real-time control for robotic systems. While existing parallel implementations aim to overcome the above limitations, they typically demand additional computational iterations and high-performance hardware, leading to only modest practical improvements. In this paper, we introduce Quattro, a transformer-accelerated iLQR framework employing an algorithm-hardware co-design strategy to predict intermediate feedback and feedforward matrices. It facilitates effective parallel computations on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on cart-pole and quadrotor systems show an algorithm-level acceleration of up to 5.3$\times$ and 27$\times$ per iteration, respectively. When integrated into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, Quattro achieves overall speedups of 2.8$\times$ for the cart-pole and 17.8$\times$ for the quadrotor compared to the one that applies traditional iLQR. Transformer inference is deployed on FPGA to maximize performance, achieving further up to 20.8$\times$ speedup over prevalent embedded CPUs with over 11$\times$ power reduction than GPU and low hardware resource overhead.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often struggle to accurately capture this intricate structure from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data, particularly due to the lack of ground truth labels and the ambiguous, intertwined nature of fiber trajectories. We present a novel deep learning framework for unsupervised clustering of myocardial fibers, providing a data-driven approach to identifying distinct fiber bundles. We uniquely combine a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to capture local sequential information along fibers, with a Transformer autoencoder to learn global shape features, with pointwise incorporation of essential anatomical context. Clustering these representations using a density-based algorithm identifies 33 to 62 robust clusters, successfully capturing the subtle distinctions in fiber trajectories with varying levels of granularity. Our framework offers a new, flexible, and quantitative way to analyze myocardial structure, achieving a level of delineation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously achieved, with potential applications in improving surgical planning, characterizing disease-related remodeling, and ultimately, advancing personalized cardiac care.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

Typically, target trajectories are assumed deterministic, but real-world aerial vehicles exhibit stochastic behavior, such as evasive maneuvers or gliders circling in thermals. This paper uses Conditional Normalizing Flows, an unsupervised Machine Learning technique, to learn and predict the stochastic behavior of targets of guided missiles using trajectory data. The trained model predicts the distribution of future target positions based on initial conditions and parameters of the dynamics. Samples from this distribution are clustered using a time series k-means algorithm to generate representative trajectories, termed virtual targets. The method is fast and target-agnostic, requiring only training data in the form of target trajectories. Thus, it serves as a drop-in replacement for deterministic trajectory predictions in guidance laws and path planning. Simulated scenarios demonstrate the approach's effectiveness for aerial vehicles with random maneuvers, bridging the gap between deterministic predictions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>will ...</summary><p>will be submitted to Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics</p></details> |

Point-based solutions rely on position annotations of WiFi fingerprints. Trajectory-based solutions, however, require end-position annotations of WiFi trajectories, where a WiFi trajectory is a multivariate time series of signal features. A trajectory dataset is much larger than a pointwise dataset as the number of potential trajectories in a field may grow exponentially with respect to the size of the field. This work presents a semi-self representation learning solution, where a large dataset $C$ of crowdsourced unlabeled WiFi trajectories can be automatically labeled by a much smaller dataset $\tilde C$ of labeled WiFi trajectories. The size of $\tilde C$ only needs to be proportional to the size of the physical field, while the unlabeled $C$ could be much larger. This is made possible through a novel ``cut-and-flip'' augmentation scheme based on the meet-in-the-middle paradigm. A two-stage learning consisting of trajectory embedding followed by endpoint embedding is proposed for the unlabeled $C$. Then the learned representations are labeled by $\tilde C$ and connected to a neural-based localization network. The result, while delivering promising accuracy, significantly relieves the burden of human annotations for trajectory-based localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VTC2025-Spring</p></details> |
| **[ACTIVE: Continuous Similarity Search for Vessel Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01142v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Publicly available vessel trajectory data is emitted continuously from the global AIS system. Continuous trajectory similarity search on this data has applications in, e.g., maritime navigation and safety. Existing proposals typically assume an offline setting and focus on finding similarities between complete trajectories. Such proposals are less effective when applied to online scenarios, where similarity comparisons must be performed continuously as new trajectory data arrives and trajectories evolve. We therefore propose a real-time continuous trajectory similarity search method for vessels (ACTIVE). We introduce a novel similarity measure, object-trajectory real-time distance, that emphasizes the anticipated future movement trends of vessels, enabling more predictive and forward-looking comparisons. Next, we propose a segment-based vessel trajectory index structure that organizes historical trajectories into smaller and manageable segments, facilitating accelerated similarity computations. Leveraging this index, we propose an efficient continuous similar trajectory search (CSTS) algorithm together with a variety of search space pruning strategies that reduce unnecessary computations during the continuous similarity search, thereby further improving efficiency. Extensive experiments on two large real-world AIS datasets offer evidence that ACTIVE is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods considerably. ACTIVE significantly reduces index construction costs and index size while achieving a 70% reduction in terms of query time and a 60% increase in terms of hit rate.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we aim to learn the trajectory prediction model by using broad out-of-domain data to improve its performance and generalization ability. Trajectory model is designed to predict any-point trajectories in the current frame given an instruction and can provide detailed control guidance for robotic policy learning. To handle the diverse out-of-domain data distribution, we propose a sparsely-gated MoE (\textbf{Top-1} gating strategy) architecture for trajectory model, coined as \textbf{Tra-MoE}. The sparse activation design enables good balance between parameter cooperation and specialization, effectively benefiting from large-scale out-of-domain data while maintaining constant FLOPs per token. In addition, we further introduce an adaptive policy conditioning technique by learning 2D mask representations for predicted trajectories, which is explicitly aligned with image observations to guide action prediction more flexibly. We perform extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world scenarios to verify the effectiveness of Tra-MoE and adaptive policy conditioning technique. We also conduct a comprehensive empirical study to train Tra-MoE, demonstrating that our Tra-MoE consistently exhibits superior performance compared to the dense baseline model, even when the latter is scaled to match Tra-MoE's parameter count.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

| **[Timely Trajectory Reconstruction in Finite Buffer Remote Tracking Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00849v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote tracking systems play a critical role in applications such as IoT, monitoring, surveillance and healthcare. In such systems, maintaining both real-time state awareness (for online decision making) and accurate reconstruction of historical trajectories (for offline post-processing) are essential. While the Age of Information (AoI) metric has been extensively studied as a measure of freshness, it does not capture the accuracy with which past trajectories can be reconstructed. In this work, we investigate reconstruction error as a complementary metric to AoI, addressing the trade-off between timely updates and historical accuracy. Specifically, we consider three policies, each prioritizing different aspects of information management: Keep-Old, Keep-Fresh, and our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy. We compare these policies in terms of impact on both AoI and reconstruction error in a remote tracking system with a finite buffer. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of queueing behavior, we demonstrate that while the Keep-Fresh policy minimizes AoI, it does not necessarily minimize reconstruction error. In contrast, our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy dynamically adjusts packet retention decisions based on generation times, achieving a balance between AoI and reconstruction error. Our results provide key insights into the design of efficient update policies for resource-constrained IoT networks.</p></details> |  |

Existing prediction algorithms focus on extracting more detailed scene features or selecting more reasonable trajectory destinations. However, in the face of dynamic and evolving future movements of the target vehicle, these algorithms cannot provide a fine-grained and continuous description of future behaviors and lane constraints, which degrades the prediction accuracy. To address this challenge, we present BLNet, a novel dualstream architecture that synergistically integrates behavioral intention recognition and lane constraint modeling through parallel attention mechanisms. The framework generates fine-grained behavior state queries (capturing spatial-temporal movement patterns) and lane queries (encoding lane topology constraints), supervised by two auxiliary losses, respectively. Subsequently, a two-stage decoder first produces trajectory proposals, then performs point-level refinement by jointly incorporating both the continuity of passed lanes and future motion features. Extensive experiments on two large datasets, nuScenes and Argoverse, show that our network exhibits significant performance gains over existing direct regression and goal-based algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

The proposed system employs multiple UAVs equipped with dual-functional radar-communication capabilities to simultaneously perform target sensing and provide communication services to users. We formulate a joint optimization problem that aims to maximize the sum rate of users while maintaining target sensing performance through coordinated beamforming and UAV trajectory design. To address this challenging non-convex problem, we develop a block coordinated descent (BCD)-based iterative algorithm that decomposes the original problem into tractable subproblems. Then, the beamforming design problem is addressed using fractional programming, while the UAV trajectory is refined through the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization approach achieves significant performance improvements in both communication throughput and sensing accuracy compared to conventional, separated designs. We also show that proper coordination of multiple UAVs through optimized trajectories and beamforming patterns can effectively balance the tradeoff between sensing and communication objectives.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

To this end, an accurate prediction of dynamic obstacle trajectories is vital. Traditional approaches to trajectory prediction face limitations in generalizability and often fail to account for the intentions of other vessels. While recent research has considered incorporating the intentions of dynamic obstacles, these efforts are typically based on the own-ship's interpretation of the situation. The current state-of-the-art in this area is a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model, which infers target vessel intentions by considering multiple underlying causes and allowing for different interpretations of the situation by different vessels. However, since its inception, there have not been any significant structural improvements to this model. In this paper, we propose enhancing the DBN model by incorporating considerations for grounding hazards and vessel waypoint information. The proposed model is validated using real vessel encounters extracted from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.</p></details> |  |

Although mmWaves can offer a notably high data rate, their high penetration and propagation losses mean that line of sight (LoS) is necessary for effective communication. Due to the presence of obstacles and user mobility, UAV trajectory planning plays a crucial role in improving system performance. In this work, we propose a novel computational geometry-based trajectory planning scheme by considering the user mobility, the priority of the delay sensitive ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) and the high throughput requirements of the enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) traffic. Specifically, we use geometric tools like Apollonius circle and minimum enclosing ball of balls to find the optimal position of the UAV that supports uninterrupted connections to the URLLC users and maximizes the aggregate throughput of the eMBB users. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate the benefits of the suggested approach over an existing state of the art benchmark scheme in terms of sum throughput obtained by URLLC and eMBB users.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to a reputed conference</p></details> |

This article presents an extension of the HMPC formulation to track periodic harmonic/sinusoidal references and discusses its use for tracking arbitrary trajectories. The proposed formulation inherits the benefits of its predecessor, namely its good performance and large domain of attraction when using small prediction horizons, and that the complexity of its optimization problem does not depend on the period of the reference.

| **[Aligning Diffusion Model with Problem Constraints for Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00342v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently emerged as effective generative frameworks for trajectory optimization, capable of producing high-quality and diverse solutions. However, training these models in a purely data-driven manner without explicit incorporation of constraint information often leads to violations of critical constraints, such as goal-reaching, collision avoidance, and adherence to system dynamics. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that aligns diffusion models explicitly with problem-specific constraints, drawing insights from the Dynamic Data-driven Application Systems (DDDAS) framework. Our approach introduces a hybrid loss function that explicitly measures and penalizes constraint violations during training. Furthermore, by statistically analyzing how constraint violations evolve throughout the diffusion steps, we develop a re-weighting strategy that aligns predicted violations to ground truth statistics at each diffusion step. Evaluated on a tabletop manipulation and a two-car reach-avoid problem, our constraint-aligned diffusion model significantly reduces constraint violations compared to traditional diffusion models, while maintaining the quality of trajectory solutions. This approach is well-suited for integration into the DDDAS framework for efficient online trajectory adaptation as new environmental data becomes available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Velocity and Acceleration: Self-Supervised Motion Consistency for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24272v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human motion is crucial for accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction. Conventional methods typically rely on supervised learning, where ground-truth labels are directly optimized against predicted trajectories. This amplifies the limitations caused by long-tailed data distributions, making it difficult for the model to capture abnormal behaviors. In this work, we propose a self-supervised pedestrian trajectory prediction framework that explicitly models position, velocity, and acceleration. We leverage velocity and acceleration information to enhance position prediction through feature injection and a self-supervised motion consistency mechanism. Our model hierarchically injects velocity features into the position stream. Acceleration features are injected into the velocity stream. This enables the model to predict position, velocity, and acceleration jointly. From the predicted position, we compute corresponding pseudo velocity and acceleration, allowing the model to learn from data-generated pseudo labels and thus achieve self-supervised learning. We further design a motion consistency evaluation strategy grounded in physical principles; it selects the most reasonable predicted motion trend by comparing it with historical dynamics and uses this trend to guide and constrain trajectory generation. We conduct experiments on the ETH-UCY and Stanford Drone datasets, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions with Diffuser for Safety-Critical Trajectory Planning at Signal-Free Intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00162v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning safe and efficient trajectories through signal-free intersections presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in dynamic, multi-task environments with unpredictable interactions and an increased possibility of conflicts. This study aims to address these challenges by developing a unified, robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety and efficiency across three distinct intersection movements: left-turn, right-turn, and straight-ahead. Existing methods often struggle to reliably ensure safety and effectively learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in such environments. This study proposes a safety-critical planning method that integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF) with a diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser (DSC-Diffuser). The DSC-Diffuser leverages task-guided planning to enhance efficiency, allowing the simultaneous learning of multiple driving tasks from real-world expert demonstrations. Moreover, the incorporation of goal-oriented constraints significantly reduces displacement errors, ensuring precise trajectory execution. To further ensure driving safety in dynamic environments, the proposed DHOCBF framework dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of surrounding vehicles, offering enhanced adaptability and reduce the conservatism compared to traditional control barrier functions. Validity evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical simulations, demonstrate its robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle velocities, sizes, uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining driving safety across a wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios. Comprehensive performance evaluations demonstrate that DSC-Diffuser generates realistic, stable, and generalizable policies, providing flexibility and reliable safety assurance in complex multi-task driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 fi...</summary><p>11 figures, 5 tables, 15 pages</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Automated Driving using Target Funnels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23795v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-driving vehicles rely on sensory input to monitor their surroundings and continuously adapt to the most likely future road course. Predictive trajectory planning is based on snapshots of the (uncertain) road course as a key input. Under noisy perception data, estimates of the road course can vary significantly, leading to indecisive and erratic steering behavior. To overcome this issue, this paper introduces a predictive trajectory planning algorithm with a novel objective function: instead of targeting a single reference trajectory based on the most likely road course, tracking a series of target reference sets, called a target funnel, is considered. The proposed planning algorithm integrates probabilistic information about the road course, and thus implicitly considers regular updates to road perception. Our solution is assessed in a case study using real driving data collected from a prototype vehicle. The results demonstrate that the algorithm maintains tracking accuracy and substantially reduces undesirable steering commands in the presence of noisy road perception, achieving a 56% reduction in input costs compared to a certainty equivalent formulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to European Control Conference 2025 (ECC25)</p></details> |
| **[Language-Guided Trajectory Traversal in Disentangled Stable Diffusion Latent Space for Factorized Medical Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23623v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to generate photorealistic images from natural language prompts. These high-resolution, language-guided synthesized images are essential for the explainability of disease or exploring causal relationships. However, their potential for disentangling and controlling latent factors of variation in specialized domains like medical imaging remains under-explored. In this work, we present the first investigation of the power of pre-trained vision-language foundation models, once fine-tuned on medical image datasets, to perform latent disentanglement for factorized medical image generation and interpolation. Through extensive experiments on chest X-ray and skin datasets, we illustrate that fine-tuned, language-guided Stable Diffusion inherently learns to factorize key attributes for image generation, such as the patient's anatomical structures or disease diagnostic features. We devise a framework to identify, isolate, and manipulate key attributes through latent space trajectory traversal of generative models, facilitating precise control over medical image synthesis.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, existing datasets fall short in capturing the diversity and dynamics of VRU behaviors, making it difficult to meet the research demands of complex traffic environments. To address this gap, this study developed the OnSiteVRU datasets, which cover a variety of scenarios, including intersections, road segments, and urban villages. These datasets provide trajectory data for motor vehicles, electric bicycles, and human-powered bicycles, totaling approximately 17,429 trajectories with a precision of 0.04 seconds. The datasets integrate both aerial-view natural driving data and onboard real-time dynamic detection data, along with environmental information such as traffic signals, obstacles, and real-time maps, enabling a comprehensive reconstruction of interaction events. The results demonstrate that VRU\_Data outperforms traditional datasets in terms of VRU density and scene coverage, offering a more comprehensive representation of VRU behavioral characteristics. This provides critical support for traffic flow modeling, trajectory prediction, and autonomous driving virtual testing.

VT migration is an effective way that migrates the VT when the locations of physical entities keep changing to maintain seamless immersive VT services. However, an efficient VT migration is challenging due to the rapid movement of vehicles, dynamic workloads of Roadside Units (RSUs), and heterogeneous resources of the RSUs. To achieve efficient migration decisions and a minimum latency for the VT migration, we propose a multi-agent split Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework combined with spatio-temporal trajectory generation. In this framework, multiple split DRL agents utilize split architecture to efficiently determine VT migration decisions. Furthermore, we propose a spatio-temporal trajectory generation algorithm based on trajectory datasets and road network data to simulate vehicle trajectories, enhancing the generalization of the proposed scheme for managing VT migration in dynamic network environments. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only enhances the Quality of Experience (QoE) by 29% but also reduces the computational parameter count by approximately 25% while maintaining similar performances, enhancing users' immersive experiences in vehicular metaverses.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches have largely focused on inter-visit event predictions, overlooking the importance of intra-visit nowcasting, which provides prompt clinical insights during an ongoing patient visit. To address this gap, we introduce the task of laboratory measurement prediction within a hospital visit. We study the laboratory data that, however, remained underexplored in previous work. We propose TRACE, a Transformer-based model designed for clinical event nowcasting by encoding patient trajectories. TRACE effectively handles long sequences and captures temporal dependencies through a novel timestamp embedding that integrates decay properties and periodic patterns of data. Additionally, we introduce a smoothed mask for denoising, improving the robustness of the model. Experiments on two large-scale electronic health record datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous methods, highlighting its potential for improving patient care through more accurate laboratory measurement nowcasting.

Existing methods also generally predict agents' states without offering any state-wise measure of uncertainty. Moreover, popular multi-modal sampling methods lack any error probability estimates for each generated scene under the same prior observations, making it difficult to rank the predictions during inference time. We introduce U2Diff, a \textbf{unified} diffusion model designed to handle trajectory completion while providing state-wise \textbf{uncertainty} estimates jointly. This uncertainty estimation is achieved by augmenting the simple denoising loss with the negative log-likelihood of the predicted noise and propagating latent space uncertainty to the real state space. Additionally, we incorporate a Rank Neural Network in post-processing to enable \textbf{error probability} estimation for each generated mode, demonstrating a strong correlation with the error relative to ground truth. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in trajectory completion and forecasting across four challenging sports datasets (NBA, Basketball-U, Football-U, Soccer-U), highlighting the effectiveness of uncertainty and error probability estimation.

| **[Simplification of Trajectory Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23025v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While there are software systems that simplify trajectory streams on the fly, few curve simplification algorithms with quality guarantees fit the streaming requirements. We present streaming algorithms for two such problems under the Fr\'{e}chet distance $d_F$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for some constant $d \geq 2$. Consider a polygonal curve $\tau$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in a stream. We present a streaming algorithm that, for any $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$ and $\delta > 0$, produces a curve $\sigma$ such that $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon)\delta$ and $|\sigma|\le 2\,\mathrm{opt}-2$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far, and $\mathrm{opt} = \min\{|\sigma'|: d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i])\le \delta\}$. Let $\alpha = 2(d-1){\lfloor d/2 \rfloor}^2 + d$. The working storage is $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$. Each vertex is processed in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$ time for $d \geq 4$ . Thus, the whole $\tau$ can be simplified in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}|\tau|\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time. Ignoring polynomial factors in $1/\varepsilon$, this running time is a factor $|\tau|$ faster than the best static algorithm that offers the same guarantees. We present another streaming algorithm that, for any integer $k \geq 2$ and any $\varepsilon \in (0,\frac{1}{17})$, maintains a curve $\sigma$ such that $|\sigma| \leq 2k-2$ and $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon) \cdot \min\{d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i]): |\sigma'| \leq k\}$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far. The working storage is $O((k\varepsilon^{-1}+\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)})\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$. Each vertex is processed in $O(k\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)}\log^2\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and $O(k\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \geq 4$.</p></details> | SoCG 2025 |

Machine learning algorithms constitute the state-of-the-art in many fields but require vast data sets, which are costly and time-intensive to collect. Automated strategies for observation and exploration are crucial to enhance the efficiency of data gathering. Therefore, a novel strategy utilizing the Next-Best-Trajectory principle is developed for a robot manipulator operating in dynamic environments. Local trajectories are generated to maximize the information gained from observations along the path while avoiding collisions. We employ a voxel map for environment modeling and utilize raycasting from perspectives around a point of interest to estimate the information gain. A global ergodic trajectory planner provides an optional reference trajectory to the local planner, improving exploration and helping to avoid local minima. To enhance computational efficiency, raycasting for estimating the information gain in the environment is executed in parallel on the graphics processing unit. Benchmark results confirm the efficiency of the parallelization, while real-world experiments demonstrate the strategy's effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2025</p></details> |

However, traditional IL methods are limited by their reliance on high-quality, often scarce, expert data, and suffer from covariate shift. To address these challenges, recent advances in offline IL have incorporated suboptimal, unlabeled datasets into the training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance policy learning from mixed-quality offline datasets by leveraging task-relevant trajectory fragments and rich environmental dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a state-based search framework that stitches state-action pairs from imperfect demonstrations, generating more diverse and informative training trajectories. Experimental results on standard IL benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks showcase that our proposed method significantly improves both generalization and performance.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a reinforcement-learning framework for multi-setpoint and multi-trajectory tracking. Tracking multiple setpoints and time-varying trajectories in reinforcement learning is challenging due to the complexity of balancing multiple objectives, a difficulty further exacerbated by system uncertainties such as uncertain initial conditions and stochastic dynamics. This challenge is relevant, e.g., in bioprocesses involving microbial consortia, where precise control over population compositions is required. We introduce a novel return function based on multiplicative reciprocal saturation functions, which explicitly couples reward gains to the simultaneous satisfaction of multiple references. Through a case study involving light-mediated cybergenetic growth control in microbial consortia, we demonstrate via computational experiments that our approach achieves faster convergence, improved stability, and superior control compliance compared to conventional quadratic-cost-based return functions. Moreover, our method enables tuning of the saturation function's parameters, shaping the learning process and policy updates. By incorporating system uncertainties, our framework also demonstrates robustness, a key requirement in industrial bioprocessing. Overall, this work advances reinforcement-learning-based control strategies in bioprocess engineering, with implications in the broader field of process and systems engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Follow Your Motion: A Generic Temporal Consistency Portrait Editing Framework with Trajectory Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22225v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained conditional diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable potential in image editing. However, they often face challenges with temporal consistency, particularly in the talking head domain, where continuous changes in facial expressions intensify the level of difficulty. These issues stem from the independent editing of individual images and the inherent loss of temporal continuity during the editing process. In this paper, we introduce Follow Your Motion (FYM), a generic framework for maintaining temporal consistency in portrait editing. Specifically, given portrait images rendered by a pre-trained 3D Gaussian Splatting model, we first develop a diffusion model that intuitively and inherently learns motion trajectory changes at different scales and pixel coordinates, from the first frame to each subsequent frame. This approach ensures that temporally inconsistent edited avatars inherit the motion information from the rendered avatars. Secondly, to maintain fine-grained expression temporal consistency in talking head editing, we propose a dynamic re-weighted attention mechanism. This mechanism assigns higher weight coefficients to landmark points in space and dynamically updates these weights based on landmark loss, achieving more consistent and refined facial expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of temporal consistency and can be used to optimize and compensate for temporally inconsistent outputs in a range of applications, such as text-driven editing, relighting, and various other applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://anonymous-hub1127.github.io/FYM.github.io/</p></details> |

In such applications, camera-based perception enables the extraction of additional modalities (human pose, text) to enhance prediction accuracy. Indeed, we find that textual descriptions play a crucial role in integrating additional modalities into a unified understanding. However, online extraction of text requires the use of VLM, which may not be feasible for resource-constrained systems. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework: a student model with limited modality is distilled from a teacher model trained with full range of modalities. The comprehensive knowledge of a teacher model trained with trajectory, human pose, and text is distilled into a student model using only trajectory or human pose as a sole supplement. In doing so, we separately distill the core locomotion insights from intra-agent multi-modality and inter-agent interaction. Our generalizable framework is validated with two state-of-the-art models across three datasets on both ego-view (JRDB, SIT) and BEV-view (ETH/UCY) setups, utilizing both annotated and VLM-generated text captions. Distilled student models show consistent improvement in all prediction metrics for both full and instantaneous observations, improving up to ~13%.

In complex environments, like modern 3D video games, distribution shift and stochasticity necessitate robust approaches beyond simple action replay. In this study, we apply Inverse Dynamics Models (IDM) with different encoders and policy heads to trajectory following in a modern 3D video game -- Bleeding Edge. Additionally, we investigate several future alignment strategies that address the distribution shift caused by the aleatoric uncertainty and imperfections of the agent. We measure both the trajectory deviation distance and the first significant deviation point between the reference and the agent's trajectory and show that the optimal configuration depends on the chosen setting. Our results show that in a diverse data setting, a GPT-style policy head with an encoder trained from scratch performs the best, DINOv2 encoder with the GPT-style policy head gives the best results in the low data regime, and both GPT-style and MLP-style policy heads had comparable results when pre-trained on a diverse setting and fine-tuned for a specific behaviour setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[GripMap: An Efficient, Spatially Resolved Constraint Framework for Offline and Online Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Racing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12115v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional trajectory planning approaches for autonomous vehicles often assume a fixed vehicle model that remains constant regardless of the vehicle's location. This overlooks the critical fact that the tires and the surface are the two force-transmitting partners in vehicle dynamics; while the tires stay with the vehicle, surface conditions vary with location. Recognizing these challenges, this paper presents a novel framework for spatially resolving dynamic constraints in both offline and online planning algorithms applied to autonomous racing. We introduce the GripMap concept, which provides a spatial resolution of vehicle dynamic constraints in the Frenet frame, allowing adaptation to locally varying grip conditions. This enables compensation for location-specific effects, more efficient vehicle behavior, and increased safety, unattainable with spatially invariant vehicle models. The focus is on low storage demand and quick access through perfect hashing. This framework proved advantageous in real-world applications in the presented form. Experiments inspired by autonomous racing demonstrate its effectiveness. In future work, this framework can serve as a foundational layer for developing future interpretable learning algorithms that adjust to varying grip conditions in real-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Robotic Skill Acquisition From a Suboptimal Demonstration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03131v3)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from Demonstration (LfD) has emerged as a crucial method for robots to acquire new skills. However, when given suboptimal task trajectory demonstrations with shape characteristics reflecting human preferences but subpar dynamic attributes such as slow motion, robots not only need to mimic the behaviors but also optimize the dynamic performance. In this work, we leverage optimization-based methods to search for a superior-performing trajectory whose shape is similar to that of the demonstrated trajectory. Specifically, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to quantify the difference between two trajectories and combine it with additional performance metrics, such as collision cost, to construct the cost function. Moreover, we develop a multi-policy version of the Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP), called MSTOMP, which is more stable and robust to parameter changes. To deal with the jitter in the demonstrated trajectory, we further utilize the gain-controlling method in the frequency domain to denoise the demonstration and propose a computationally more efficient metric, called Mean Square Error in the Spectrum (MSES), that measures the trajectories' differences in the frequency domain. We also theoretically highlight the connections between the time domain and the frequency domain methods. Finally, we verify our method in both simulation experiments and real-world experiments, showcasing its improved optimization performance and stability compared to existing methods.

We propose to analyse facial landmark trajectories, a compact yet informative representation, that encodes these subtle motions from a high-level structural perspective. Hence, we introduce Trajectory-guided Motion Perception Transformer (TraMP-Former), a novel FEQA framework that fuses landmark trajectory features for fine-grained motion capture with visual semantic cues from RGB frames, ultimately regressing the combined features into a quality score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraMP-Former achieves new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with neurological disorders, including PFED5 (up by 6.51%) and an augmented Toronto NeuroFace (up by 7.62%).

Both tasks comprise transductive settings, where the model predicts links among known nodes, and in inductive settings, where it generalises learned patterns to previously unseen nodes. Existing TGN designs face a dilemma under these dual scenarios. Anonymous TGNs, which rely solely on temporal and structural information, offer strong inductive generalisation but struggle to distinguish known nodes. In contrast, non-anonymous TGNs leverage node features to excel in transductive tasks yet fail to adapt to new nodes. To address this challenge, we propose Trajectory Encoding TGN (TETGN). Our approach introduces automatically expandable node identifiers (IDs) as learnable temporal positional features and performs message passing over these IDs to capture each node's historical context. By integrating this trajectory-aware module with a standard TGN using multi-head attention, TETGN effectively balances transductive accuracy with inductive generalisation. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that TETGN significantly outperforms strong baselines on both link prediction and node classification tasks, demonstrating its ability to unify the advantages of anonymous and non-anonymous models for dynamic graph learning.</p></details> |  |

The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Trajectory Embedding for Similarity Computation: When Triangle Inequality Violations in Distance Metrics Matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10933v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity is a cornerstone of trajectory data management and analysis. Traditional similarity functions often suffer from high computational complexity and a reliance on specific distance metrics, prompting a shift towards deep representation learning in Euclidean space. However, existing Euclidean-based trajectory embeddings often face challenges due to the triangle inequality constraints that do not universally hold for trajectory data. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel approach by incorporating non-Euclidean geometry, specifically hyperbolic space, into trajectory representation learning. We present the first-ever integration of hyperbolic space to resolve the inherent limitations of the triangle inequality in Euclidean embeddings. In particular, we achieve it by designing a Lorentz distance measure, which is proven to overcome triangle inequality constraints. Additionally, we design a model-agnostic framework LH-plugin to seamlessly integrate hyperbolic embeddings into existing representation learning pipelines. This includes a novel projection method optimized with the Cosh function to prevent the diminishment of distances, supported by a theoretical foundation. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic fusion distance that intelligently adapts to variations in triangle inequality constraints across different trajectory pairs, blending Lorentzian and Euclidean distances for more robust similarity calculations. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach effectively enhances the accuracy of trajectory similarity measures in state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world datasets. The LH-plugin not only addresses the triangle inequality issues but also significantly refines the precision of trajectory similarity computations, marking a substantial advancement in the field of trajectory representation learning.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

Although predicting the ego-vehicle's path is valuable for driver-assistance systems, existing methods mainly focus on external factors like other vehicles' motions, often neglecting the driver's attention and intent. To address this gap, we infer the ego-trajectory by integrating the driver's gaze and the surrounding scene. We introduce RouteFormer, a novel multimodal ego-trajectory prediction network combining GPS data, environmental context, and the driver's field-of-view, comprising first-person video and gaze fixations. We also present the Path Complexity Index (PCI), a new metric for trajectory complexity that enables a more nuanced evaluation of challenging scenarios. To tackle data scarcity and enhance diversity, we introduce GEM, a comprehensive dataset of urban driving scenarios enriched with synchronized driver field-of-view and gaze data. Extensive evaluations on GEM and DR(eye)VE demonstrate that RouteFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving notable improvements in prediction accuracy across diverse conditions. Ablation studies reveal that incorporating driver field-of-view data yields significantly better average displacement error, especially in challenging scenarios with high PCI scores, underscoring the importance of modeling driver attention.

| **[RINGO: Real-time Navigation with a Guiding Trajectory for Aerial Manipulators in Unknown Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08338v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion planning for aerial manipulators in constrained environments has typically been limited to known environments or simplified to that of multi-rotors, which leads to poor adaptability and overly conservative trajectories. This paper presents RINGO: Real-time Navigation with a Guiding Trajectory, a novel planning framework that enables aerial manipulators to navigate unknown environments in real time. The proposed method simultaneously considers the positions of both the multi-rotor and the end-effector. A pre-obtained multi-rotor trajectory serves as a guiding reference, allowing the end-effector to generate a smooth, collision-free, and workspace-compatible trajectory. Leveraging the convex hull property of B-spline curves, we theoretically guarantee that the trajectory remains within the reachable workspace. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables real-time navigation of aerial manipulators in unknown environments. The simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method generates less conservative trajectories than approaches that consider only the multi-rotor.</p></details> | 9 pages, 15 figures |

There is a urgent need to minimize the data size in LLM training. Compared with data selection method, the data distillation method aims to synthesize a small number of data samples to achieve the training effect of the full data set and has better flexibility. Despite its successes in computer vision, the discreteness of text data has hitherto stymied its exploration in natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we proposed a method that involves learning pseudo prompt data based on trajectory matching and finding its nearest neighbor ID to achieve cross-architecture transfer. During the distillation process, we introduce a regularization loss to improve the robustness of our distilled data. To our best knowledge, this is the first data distillation work suitable for text generation tasks such as instruction tuning. Evaluations on two benchmarks, including ARC-Easy and MMLU instruction tuning datasets, established the superiority of our distillation approach over the SOTA data selection method LESS. Furthermore, our method demonstrates a good transferability over LLM structures (i.e., OPT to Llama).</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v4)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Enhancing Offline Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00601v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) relies on the availability and quality of training data, often requiring extensive interactions with specific environments. In many real-world scenarios, where data collection is costly and risky, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution by utilizing data collected by domain experts and searching for a batch-constrained optimal policy. This approach is further augmented by incorporating external data sources, expanding the range and diversity of data collection possibilities. However, existing offline RL methods often struggle with challenges posed by non-matching data from these external sources. In this work, we specifically address the problem of source-target domain mismatch in scenarios involving mixed datasets, characterized by a predominance of source data generated from random or suboptimal policies and a limited amount of target data generated from higher-quality policies. To tackle this problem, we introduce Transition Scoring (TS), a novel method that assigns scores to transitions based on their similarity to the target domain, and propose Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation (CLTV), which effectively leverages these transition scores to identify and prioritize high-quality trajectories through a curriculum learning approach. Our extensive experiments across various offline RL methods and MuJoCo environments, complemented by rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrate that CLTV enhances the overall performance and transferability of policies learned by offline RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |

Traditional assessment tools often fail to fully cover course content, leading to imprecise evaluations of student mastery. To tackle this problem, the study proposes a knowledge graph construction method based on large language models (LLMs), which transforms learning materials into structured data and generates personalized learning trajectory graphs by analyzing students' test data. Experimental results demonstrate that the model effectively alerts teachers to potential biases in their exam questions and tracks individual student progress. This system not only enhances the accuracy of learning assessments but also helps teachers provide timely guidance to students who are falling behind, thereby improving overall teaching strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Slit Mapping Based Spiral Tool Trajectory Planning for Ball-end Milling on Complex Freeform Surfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06310v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a spiral-based complete coverage strategy for ball-end milling on freeform surfaces, utilizing conformal slit mapping to generate milling trajectories that are more compact, smoother, and evenly distributed when machining 2D cavities with islands. This approach, an upgrade from traditional methods, extends the original algorithm to effectively address 3D perforated surface milling. Unlike conventional algorithms, the method embeds a continuous spiral trajectory within perforated surfaces without requiring cellular decomposition or additional boundaries. The proposed method addresses three primary challenges, including modifying conformal slit mapping for mesh surfaces, maintaining uniform scallop height between adjacent spiral trajectories, and optimizing the mapped origin point to ensure uniform scallop height distribution. To overcome these challenges, surface flattening techniques are incorporated into the original approach to accommodate mesh surfaces effectively. Tool path spacing is then optimized using a binary search strategy to regulate scallop height. A functional energy metric associated with scallop height uniformity is introduced for rapid evaluation of points mapped to the origin, with the minimum functional energy determined through perturbation techniques. The optimal placement of this point is identified using a modified gradient descent approach applied to the energy function. Validation on intricate surfaces, including low-quality and high-genus meshes, verifies the robustness of the algorithm. Surface milling experiments comparing this method with conventional techniques indicate a 15.63% improvement in scallop height uniformity while reducing machining time, average spindle impact, and spindle impact variance by up to 7.36%, 27.79%, and 55.98%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The r...</summary><p>The revised manuscript has improved the quality of the figures</p></details> |
| **[IMPACT: Behavioral Intention-aware Multimodal Trajectory Prediction with Adaptive Context Trimming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09103v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most prior research has focused on improving the precision of multimodal trajectory predictions, the explicit modeling of multimodal behavioral intentions (e.g., yielding, overtaking) remains relatively underexplored. This paper proposes a unified framework that jointly predicts both behavioral intentions and trajectories to enhance prediction accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. Specifically, we employ a shared context encoder for both intention and trajectory predictions, thereby reducing structural redundancy and information loss. Moreover, we address the lack of ground-truth behavioral intention labels in mainstream datasets (Waymo, Argoverse) by auto-labeling these datasets, thus advancing the community's efforts in this direction. We further introduce a vectorized occupancy prediction module that infers the probability of each map polyline being occupied by the target vehicle's future trajectory. By leveraging these intention and occupancy prediction priors, our method conducts dynamic, modality-dependent pruning of irrelevant agents and map polylines in the decoding stage, effectively reducing computational overhead and mitigating noise from non-critical elements. Our approach ranks first among LiDAR-free methods on the Waymo Motion Dataset and achieves first place on the Waymo Interactive Prediction Dataset. Remarkably, even without model ensembling, our single-model framework improves the soft mean average precision (softmAP) by 10 percent compared to the second-best method in the Waymo Interactive Prediction Leaderboard. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been successfully deployed on real vehicles, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | under review |

In this paper, we propose a novel method for trajectory synthesis by adapting the Time-Based Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (TimeVQVAE). Our approach leverages time-frequency domain processing, vector quantization, and transformer-based priors to capture both global and local dynamics in flight data. By discretizing the latent space and integrating transformer priors, the model learns long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and preserves coherence across entire flight paths. We evaluate the adapted TimeVQVAE using an extensive suite of quality, statistical, and distributional metrics, as well as a flyability assessment conducted in an open-source air traffic simulator. Results indicate that TimeVQVAE outperforms a temporal convolutional VAE baseline, generating synthetic trajectories that mirror real flight data in terms of spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and statistical properties. Furthermore, the simulator-based assessment shows that most generated trajectories maintain operational feasibility, although occasional outliers underscore the potential need for additional domain-specific constraints. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of multi-scale representation learning for capturing complex flight behaviors and demonstrate the promise of TimeVQVAE in producing representative synthetic trajectories for downstream tasks such as model training, airspace design, and air traffic forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was presented at the 25th Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS 2025), April 8--10, 2025, Brussels, Belgium</p></details> |
| **[AgentRewardBench: Evaluating Automatic Evaluations of Web Agent Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08942v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web agents enable users to perform tasks on web browsers through natural language interaction. Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations. We release the benchmark at: https://agent-reward-bench.github.io</p></details> |  |

In This paper, an adaptive transpose Jacobian approach is proposed to deal with the dynamic model complexity, which utilizes an adaptive PI-algorithm to adjust the control gains. The performance of the proposed control algorithm is compared with the conventional transpose Jacobian and sliding mode control algorithms and evaluated by the root mean square of the errors and control input energy criteria. In order to appraise the effectiveness of the proposed control system, simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink software for a quadruped robot leg for semi-elliptical path tracking. The obtained results show that the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian reduces the overshoot and root mean square of the errors and at the same time, decreases the control input energy. Moreover, transpose Jacobin and adaptive transpose Jacobian are more robust to changes in initial conditions compared to the conventional sliding mode control. Furthermore, sliding mode control performs well up to 20% uncertainties in the parameters due to its model-based nature, whereas the transpose Jacobin and the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian algorithms show promising results even in higher mass uncertainties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Xplore</p></details> |
| **[On trajectory design from motion primitives for near time-optimal transitions for systems with oscillating internal dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19144v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An efficient approach to compute near time-optimal trajectories for linear kinematic systems with oscillatory internal dynamics is presented. Thereby, kinematic constraints with respect to velocity, acceleration and jerk are taken into account. The trajectories are composed of several motion primitives, the most crucial of which is termed jerk segment. Within this contribution, the focus is put on the composition of the overall trajectories, assuming the required motion primitives to be readily available. Since the scheme considered is not time-optimal, even decreasing particular constraints can reduce the overall transition time, which is analysed in detail. This observation implies that replanning of the underlying jerk segments is required as an integral part of the motion planning scheme, further insight into which has been analysed in a complementary contribution. Although the proposed scheme is not time-optimal, it allows for significantly shorter transition times than established methods, such as zero-vibration shaping, while requiring significantly lower computational power than a fully time-optimal scheme.</p></details> |  |

The proposed filter, the trajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the set of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the set of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated with the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM posterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM density on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution for multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating the set of target states at the end of each time window. Additionally, the paper proposes computationally lighter alternatives to the TM-PMBM filter by deriving a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) density through Kullback-Leibler divergence minimisation in an augmented space with auxiliary variables. The performance of the proposed filters are evaluated in a simulation study.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, journal paper</p></details> |

Moreover, incorporating prior information input into such perception model represents an effective approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy. However, utilizing diverse sources of prior information still faces three key challenges: the acquisition of high-quality prior information, alignment between prior and online perception, efficient integration. To address these issues, we investigate prior augmentation from a novel perspective of trajectory priors. In this paper, we initially extract crowdsourcing trajectory data from Argoverse2 motion forecasting dataset and encode trajectory data into rasterized heatmap and vectorized instance tokens, then we incorporate such prior information into the online mapping model through different ways. Besides, with the purpose of mitigating the misalignment between prior and online perception, we design a confidence-based fusion module that takes alignment into account during the fusion process. We conduct extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 dataset. The results indicate that our method's performance significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

However, estimating trajectories of brain biomarkers is challenging due to biological variability, inconsistencies in measurement protocols (e.g., differences in MRI scanners), scarcity, and irregularity in longitudinal measurements. Herein, we introduce a novel personalized deep kernel regression framework for forecasting brain biomarkers, with application to regional volumetric measurements. Our approach integrates two key components: a population model that captures brain trajectories from a large and diverse cohort, and a subject-specific model that captures individual trajectories. To optimally combine these, we propose Adaptive Shrinkage Estimation, which effectively balances population and subject-specific models. We assess our model's performance through predictive accuracy metrics, uncertainty quantification, and validation against external clinical studies. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models -- including linear mixed effects models, generalized additive models, and deep learning methods -- demonstrates the superior predictive performance of our approach. Additionally, we apply our method to predict trajectories of composite neuroimaging biomarkers, which highlights the versatility of our approach in modeling the progression of longitudinal neuroimaging biomarkers. Furthermore, validation on three external neuroimaging studies confirms the robustness of our method across different clinical contexts. We make the code available at https://github.com/vatass/AdaptiveShrinkageDKGP.</p></details> |  |

In cinematography, Directors of Photography meticulously craft camera movements to achieve expressive and intentional framing. However, existing methods for camera trajectory generation remain limited: Traditional approaches rely on geometric optimization or handcrafted procedural systems, while recent learning-based methods often inherit structural biases or lack textual alignment, constraining creative synthesis. In this work, we introduce an auto-regressive model inspired by the expertise of Directors of Photography to generate artistic and expressive camera trajectories. We first introduce DataDoP, a large-scale multi-modal dataset containing 29K real-world shots with free-moving camera trajectories, depth maps, and detailed captions in specific movements, interaction with the scene, and directorial intent. Thanks to the comprehensive and diverse database, we further train an auto-regressive, decoder-only Transformer for high-quality, context-aware camera movement generation based on text guidance and RGBD inputs, named GenDoP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to existing methods, GenDoP offers better controllability, finer-grained trajectory adjustments, and higher motion stability. We believe our approach establishes a new standard for learning-based cinematography, paving the way for future advancements in camera control and filmmaking.

Traditional approaches often rely on static snapshots of network states, which can obscure the underlying dynamics of opinion evolution. In this study, we introduce a dynamic framework that quantifies the unpredictability of opinion trajectories using the normalized Lempel-Ziv (nLZ) complexity. Our approach leverages an adaptive social network model where each node is characterized by three behavioral parameters - homophily, neophily, and social conformity - and where opinions evolve continuously according to a system of ordinary differential equations. The results reveal distinct nLZ complexity signatures for each node type: homophilic nodes exhibit consistently rising complexity, reflecting increasingly unpredictable opinion shifts that are counterintuitive given their tendency for similarity; neophilic nodes maintain low and stable complexity, suggesting that openness to novelty can, surprisingly, lead to stable opinion dynamics; and conformic nodes display a U-shaped complexity trend, transitioning from early opinion stagnation to later unpredictability. In fully heterogeneous networks, modest interaction effects emerge, with slight shifts in the unpredictability of each faction's trajectories. These findings underscore the importance of temporal analysis in uncovering hidden dynamical patterns, offering novel insights into the mechanisms underlying social adaptation and polarization.</p></details> |  |

Typically such approaches operate by computing $\tilde{N}$ perturbed rollouts around the nominal dynamics to estimate the collision risk associated with a sequence of control commands. We consider a setting where it is expensive to estimate risk using perturbed rollouts, for example, due to expensive collision-checks. We put forward two key contributions. First, we develop an algorithm that distills the statistical information from a larger set of rollouts to a reduced-set with sample size $N<<\tilde{N}$. Consequently, we estimate collision risk using just $N$ rollouts instead of $\tilde{N}$. Second, we formulate a novel surrogate for the collision risk that can leverage the distilled statistical information contained in the reduced-set. We formalize both algorithmic contributions using distribution embedding in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We perform extensive benchmarking to demonstrate that our MMD-based approach leads to safer trajectories at low sample regime than existing baselines using Conditional Value-at Risk (CVaR) based collision risk estimate.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Basant1861/MPC-MMD</p></details> |

The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Novel Diffusion Models for Multimodal 3D Hand Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07375v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting hand motion is critical for understanding human intentions and bridging the action space between human movements and robot manipulations. Existing hand trajectory prediction (HTP) methods forecast the future hand waypoints in 3D space conditioned on past egocentric observations. However, such models are only designed to accommodate 2D egocentric video inputs. There is a lack of awareness of multimodal environmental information from both 2D and 3D observations, hindering the further improvement of 3D HTP performance. In addition, these models overlook the synergy between hand movements and headset camera egomotion, either predicting hand trajectories in isolation or encoding egomotion only from past frames. To address these limitations, we propose novel diffusion models (MMTwin) for multimodal 3D hand trajectory prediction. MMTwin is designed to absorb multimodal information as input encompassing 2D RGB images, 3D point clouds, past hand waypoints, and text prompt. Besides, two latent diffusion models, the egomotion diffusion and the HTP diffusion as twins, are integrated into MMTwin to predict camera egomotion and future hand trajectories concurrently. We propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer module as the denoising model of the HTP diffusion to better fuse multimodal features. The experimental results on three publicly available datasets and our self-recorded data demonstrate that our proposed MMTwin can predict plausible future 3D hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and generalizes well to unseen environments. The code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/MMTwin.</p></details> |  |

It performs optimal controls by directly harnessing input-output (I/O) data, bypassing the process of explicit model identification that can be costly and time-consuming. However, its high computational complexity, driven by a large-scale optimization problem (typically in a higher dimension than its model-based counterpart--Model Predictive Control), hinders real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose the data-enabled neighboring extremal (DeeNE) framework, which significantly reduces computational cost while preserving control performance. DeeNE leverages first-order optimality perturbation analysis to efficiently update a precomputed nominal DeePC solution in response to changes in initial conditions and reference trajectories. We validate its effectiveness on a 7-DoF KINOVA Gen3 robotic arm, demonstrating substantial computational savings and robust, data-driven control performance.</p></details> |  |

Current methods in this space require specific architectural changes to image generation models, which limit their adaptability and scalability. In contrast to such methods, we provide a model-agnostic approach. We use intersections in diffusion trajectories, working only with the latent values. We could not obtain localized frame-wise coherence and diversity using only the intersection of trajectories. Thus, we instead use a grid-based approach. An in-context trained LLM is used to generate coherent frame-wise prompts; another is used to identify differences between frames. Based on these, we obtain a CLIP-based attention mask that controls the timing of switching the prompts for each grid cell. Earlier switching results in higher variance, while later switching results in more coherence. Therefore, our approach can ensure appropriate control between coherence and variance for the frames. Our approach results in state-of-the-art performance while being more flexible when working with diverse image-generation models. The empirical analysis using quantitative metrics and user studies confirms our model's superior temporal consistency, visual fidelity and user satisfaction, thus providing a novel way to obtain training-free, image-based text-to-video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> |

Yet, to fully realize its potential, an effective online trajectory evaluation is indispensable to ensure safety. By forecasting the future outcomes of a given trajectory, trajectory evaluation becomes much more effective. This goal can be achieved by employing a world model to capture environmental dynamics and predict future states. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end driving framework WoTE, which leverages a BEV World model to predict future BEV states for Trajectory Evaluation. The proposed BEV world model is latency-efficient compared to image-level world models and can be seamlessly supervised using off-the-shelf BEV-space traffic simulators.

However, open-loop training on the nuPlan dataset tends to cause causal confusion during closed-loop testing, and the dataset also presents a long-tail distribution of scenarios. These issues introduce challenges for imitation learning. To tackle these problems, we introduce CAFE-AD, a Cross-Scenario Adaptive Feature Enhancement for Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving method, designed to enhance feature representation across various scenario types. We develop an adaptive feature pruning module that ranks feature importance to capture the most relevant information while reducing the interference of noisy information during training. Moreover, we propose a cross-scenario feature interpolation module that enhances scenario information to introduce diversity, enabling the network to alleviate over-fitting in dominant scenarios. We evaluate our method CAFE-AD on the challenging public nuPlan Test14-Hard closed-loop simulation benchmark. The results demonstrate that CAFE-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods including rule-based and hybrid planners, and exhibits the potential in mitigating the impact of long-tail distribution within the dataset. Additionally, we further validate its effectiveness in real-world environments. The code and models will be made available at https://github.com/AlniyatRui/CAFE-AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA ...</summary><p>ICRA 2025; first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

The optimization process yields an optimal control sequence that depends on the initial conditions and system parameters. However, the optimal sequence may result in undesirable behavior if the system's initial conditions and parameters are erroneous. This work presents a data-driven fuzzy controller synthesis framework that is guided by a time-optimal trajectory for multicopter tracking problems. In particular, we consider an aggressive maneuver consisting of a mid-air flip and generate a time-optimal trajectory by numerically solving the two-point boundary value problem. A fuzzy controller consisting of a stabilizing controller near hover conditions and an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) controller, trained to mimic the time-optimal aggressive trajectory, is constructed using the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MECC 2025</p></details> |

The proposed approach is effective with both complete and partial observations, producing refined trajectory signals with kinematic consistency, ensuring that velocity is the integral of acceleration and position is the integral of velocity. Additionally, the method accounts for the constraint that vehicles can only move in the direction of their orientation. The method is implemented as a configurable python library that also enables trajectory estimation solely based on position data. Regularization is applied to prevent extreme state variations.

Specifically, the UAV's kinematic and camera control inputs are jointly optimized over a rolling planning horizon to achieve complete 3D coverage of the object. The proposed controller incorporates ray-tracing into the planning process to simulate the propagation of light rays, thereby determining the visible parts of the object through the UAV's camera. This integration enables the generation of precise look-ahead coverage trajectories. The coverage planning problem is formulated as a rolling finite-horizon optimal control problem and solved using mixed-integer programming techniques. Extensive real-world and synthetic experiments validate the performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

Aiming at this issue, this paper investigates a differential flatness-based trajectory optimization method for fixed-wing UAVs (DFTO-FW). The customized trajectory representation is presented through differential flat characteristics analysis and polynomial parameterization, eliminating equality constraints to avoid the heavy computational burdens of solving complex dynamics. Through the design of integral performance costs and derivation of analytical gradients, the original trajectory optimization is transcribed into a lightweight, unconstrained, gradient-analytical optimization with linear time complexity to improve efficiency further. The simulation experiments illustrate the superior efficiency of the DFTO-FW, which takes sub-second CPU time (on a personal desktop) against other competitors by orders of magnitude to generate fixed-wing UAV trajectories in randomly generated obstacle environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version with minor language and formatting edits.

The proposed method is measurement-based and decomposes the voltage trajectory into two key components using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD): a residual part, which indicates delayed voltage recovery, and an oscillatory part, which captures oscillations. The residual component is critical, as it can detect activation of OELs in synchronous generators or Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) relays in inverter-based resources, potentially leading to instability within the quasisteady-state time frame. Meanwhile, the oscillatory component may indicate either a stable or unstable state in the short term. To accurately assess stability, STVSI employs an entropy-based metric to measure the proximity of the system to instability, with specific indices for short-term voltage stability based on oscillations and recovery. Simulations on the Nordic power system demonstrate that STVSI effectively identifies and categorizes voltage stability issues. Moreover, STVSI not only detects voltage stability conditions but also qualitatively assesses the extent of stability, providing a nuanced measure of stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted for publication in IEEE PESGM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Vision-Language Model Predictive Control for Manipulation Planning and Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05225v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a widely adopted control paradigm that leverages predictive models to estimate future system states and optimize control inputs accordingly. However, while MPC excels in planning and control, it lacks the capability for environmental perception, leading to failures in complex and unstructured scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce Vision-Language Model Predictive Control (VLMPC), a robotic manipulation planning framework that integrates the perception power of vision-language models (VLMs) with MPC. VLMPC utilizes a conditional action sampling module that takes a goal image or language instruction as input and leverages VLM to generate candidate action sequences. These candidates are fed into a video prediction model that simulates future frames based on the actions. In addition, we propose an enhanced variant, Traj-VLMPC, which replaces video prediction with motion trajectory generation to reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. Traj-VLMPC estimates motion dynamics conditioned on the candidate actions, offering a more efficient alternative for long-horizon tasks and real-time applications. Both VLMPC and Traj-VLMPC select the optimal action sequence using a VLM-based hierarchical cost function that captures both pixel-level and knowledge-level consistency between the current observation and the task input. We demonstrate that both approaches outperform existing state-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks and achieve excellent performance in various real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Despite recent advancements in place recognition using 2D cameras or 3D LiDAR, it remains to be seen how to use 4D radar for place recognition - an increasingly popular sensor for its robustness against adverse weather and lighting conditions. Compared to LiDAR point clouds, radar data are drastically sparser, noisier and in much lower resolution, which hampers their ability to effectively represent scenes, posing significant challenges for 4D radar-based place recognition. This work addresses these challenges by leveraging multi-modal information from sequential 4D radar scans and effectively extracting and aggregating spatio-temporal features.Our approach follows a principled pipeline that comprises (1) dynamic points removal and ego-velocity estimation from velocity property, (2) bird's eye view (BEV) feature encoding on the refined point cloud, (3) feature alignment using BEV feature map motion trajectory calculated by ego-velocity, (4) multi-scale spatio-temporal features of the aligned BEV feature maps are extracted and aggregated.Real-world experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed method and demonstrate its robustness in handling dynamic environments.

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging an intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.</p></details> |  |

STO maintains the maneuver strategy of the high-level global planner while allowing curvature discontinuities at switching points to improve maneuver efficiency. To ensure safety, a convex corridor is constructed via GJK-accelerated ellipse shrinking and expansion, serving as safety constraints in each iteration. Numerical simulations in perpendicular and reverse-angled parking scenarios demonstrate that STO enhances maneuver efficiency while ensuring safety.

| **[DyTTP: Trajectory Prediction with Normalization-Free Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05356v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is a cornerstone for the safe operation of autonomous driving systems, where understanding the dynamic behavior of surrounding agents is crucial. Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAMDTP: Dynamic Trajectory Prediction with Graph Attention Mamba Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04862v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate motion prediction of traffic agents is crucial for the safety and stability of autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we introduce GAMDTP, a novel graph attention-based network tailored for dynamic trajectory prediction. Specifically, we fuse the result of self attention and mamba-ssm through a gate mechanism, leveraging the strengths of both to extract features more efficiently and accurately, in each graph convolution layer. GAMDTP encodes the high-definition map(HD map) data and the agents' historical trajectory coordinates and decodes the network's output to generate the final prediction results. Additionally, recent approaches predominantly focus on dynamically fusing historical forecast results and rely on two-stage frameworks including proposal and refinement. To further enhance the performance of the two-stage frameworks we also design a scoring mechanism to evaluate the prediction quality during the proposal and refinement processes. Experiments on the Argoverse dataset demonstrates that GAMDTP achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving superior accuracy in dynamic trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization of Stochastic Systems under Chance Constraints via Set Erosion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04705v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the trajectory optimization problem under chance constraints for continuous-time stochastic systems. To address chance constraints imposed on the entire stochastic trajectory, we propose a framework based on the set erosion strategy, which converts the chance constraints into safety constraints on an eroded subset of the safe set along the corresponding deterministic trajectory. The depth of erosion is captured by the probabilistic bound on the distance between the stochastic trajectory and its deterministic counterpart, for which we utilize a novel and sharp probabilistic bound developed recently. By adopting this framework, a deterministic control input sequence can be obtained, whose feasibility and performance are demonstrated through theoretical analysis. Our framework is compatible with various deterministic optimal control techniques, offering great flexibility and computational efficiency in a wide range of scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, our method provides the first scalable trajectory optimization scheme for high-dimensional stochastic systems under trajectory level chance constraints. We validate the proposed method through two numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Planning Safety Trajectories with Dual-Phase, Physics-Informed, and Transportation Knowledge-Driven Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04562v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have demonstrated strong reasoning and generalization capabilities in driving-related tasks, including scene understanding, planning, and control. However, they still face challenges in hallucinations, uncertainty, and long inference latency. While existing foundation models have general knowledge of avoiding collisions, they often lack transportation-specific safety knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LetsPi, a physics-informed, dual-phase, knowledge-driven framework for safe, human-like trajectory planning. To prevent hallucinations and minimize uncertainty, this hybrid framework integrates Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning with physics-informed social force dynamics. LetsPi leverages the LLM to analyze driving scenes and historical information, providing appropriate parameters and target destinations (goals) for the social force model, which then generates the future trajectory. Moreover, the dual-phase architecture balances reasoning and computational efficiency through its Memory Collection phase and Fast Inference phase. The Memory Collection phase leverages the physics-informed LLM to process and refine planning results through reasoning, reflection, and memory modules, storing safe, high-quality driving experiences in a memory bank. Surrogate safety measures and physics-informed prompt techniques are introduced to enhance the LLM's knowledge of transportation safety and physical force, respectively. The Fast Inference phase extracts similar driving experiences as few-shot examples for new scenarios, while simplifying input-output requirements to enable rapid trajectory planning without compromising safety. Extensive experiments using the HighD dataset demonstrate that LetsPi outperforms baseline models across five safety metrics.See PDF for project Github link.</p></details> |  |
| **[A High-Speed Time-Optimal Trajectory Generation Strategy via a Two-layer Planning Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11072v2)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion planning and trajectory generation are crucial technologies in various domains including the control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, manipulators, and rockets. However, optimization-based real-time motion planning becomes increasingly challenging due to the problem's probable non-convexity and the inherent limitations of non-linear programming algorithms. Highly nonlinear dynamics, obstacle avoidance constraints, and non-convex inputs can exacerbate these difficulties. In order to enhance the robustness and reduce the computational burden, this paper proposes a two-layer trajectory generating algorithm for intelligent ground vehicles with convex optimization methods, aiming to provide real-time guarantees for trajectory optimization and to improve the calculate speed of motion prediction. Our approach involves breaking down the original problem into small horizon-based planning cycles with fixed final times, referred to as planning cycles. Each planning cycle is then solved within a series of restricted convex sets constructed by some customized search algorithms incrementally. We rigorously establish these advantages through mathematical analysis under moderate assumptions and comprehensive experimental validations. For linear vehicle models, comparative experiments with general sequential convex programming algorithms demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method, particularly in terms of the computational efficiency in dynamic maps and the reduced final time.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Self-Supervised Learning Approach with Differentiable Optimization for UAV Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04289v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant traction across various fields, path planning in 3D environments remains a critical challenge, particularly under size, weight, and power (SWAP) constraints. Traditional modular planning systems often introduce latency and suboptimal performance due to limited information sharing and local minima issues. End-to-end learning approaches streamline the pipeline by mapping sensory observations directly to actions but require large-scale datasets, face significant sim-to-real gaps, or lack dynamical feasibility. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised UAV trajectory planning pipeline that integrates a learning-based depth perception with differentiable trajectory optimization. A 3D cost map guides UAV behavior without expert demonstrations or human labels. Additionally, we incorporate a neural network-based time allocation strategy to improve the efficiency and optimality. The system thus combines robust learning-based perception with reliable physics-based optimization for improved generalizability and interpretability. Both simulation and real-world experiments validate our approach across various environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. Our method achieves a 31.33% improvement in position tracking error and 49.37% reduction in control effort compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear second-order dynamics describe labial constriction trajectories across languages and contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08351v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the dynamics of labial constriction trajectories during the production of /b/ and /m/ in English and Mandarin. We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v6)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Sound Source Trajectories for Universal Sound Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04843v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods utilizing spatial information for sound source separation require prior knowledge of the direction of arrival (DOA) of the source or utilize estimated but imprecise localization results, which impairs the separation performance, especially when the sound sources are moving. In fact, sound source localization and separation are interconnected problems, that is, sound source localization facilitates sound separation while sound separation contributes to refined source localization. This paper proposes a method utilizing the mutual facilitation mechanism between sound source localization and separation for moving sources. The proposed method comprises three stages. The first stage is initial tracking, which tracks each sound source from the audio mixture based on the source signal envelope estimation. These tracking results may lack sufficient accuracy. The second stage involves mutual facilitation: Sound separation is conducted using preliminary sound source tracking results. Subsequently, sound source tracking is performed on the separated signals, thereby refining the tracking precision. The refined trajectories further improve separation performance. This mutual facilitation process can be iterated multiple times. In the third stage, a neural beamformer estimates precise single-channel separation results based on the refined tracking trajectories and multi-channel separation outputs. Simulation experiments conducted under reverberant conditions and with moving sound sources demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve more accurate separation based on refined tracking results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing(TASLP)</p></details> |

When humans grasp an object, appropriate trajectories naturally form in our minds to use it for specific tasks. Hand-object interaction trajectory priors can greatly benefit applications in robotics, embodied AI, augmented reality and related fields. However, synthesizing realistic and appropriate hand trajectories given a single object or hand-object interaction image is a highly ambiguous task, requiring to correctly identify the object of interest and possibly even the correct interaction among many possible alternatives. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose the SIGHT-Fusion system, consisting of a curated pipeline for extracting visual features of hand-object interaction details from egocentric videos involving object manipulation, and a diffusion-based conditional motion generation model processing the extracted features. We train our method given video data with corresponding hand trajectory annotations, without supervision in the form of action labels. For the evaluation, we establish benchmarks utilizing the first-person FPHAB and HOI4D datasets, testing our method against various baselines and using multiple metrics. We also introduce task simulators for executing the generated hand trajectories and reporting task success rates as an additional metric. Experiments show that our method generates more appropriate and realistic hand trajectories than baselines and presents promising generalization capability on unseen objects. The accuracy of the generated hand trajectories is confirmed in a physics simulation setting, showcasing the authenticity of the created sequences and their applicability in downstream uses.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning approaches have become key in this area, utilizing large-scale trajectory datasets to model movement patterns, but face challenges in managing complex spatial dependencies and adapting to dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce TrajLearn, a novel model for trajectory prediction that leverages generative modeling of higher-order mobility flows based on hexagonal spatial representation. TrajLearn predicts the next $k$ steps by integrating a customized beam search for exploring multiple potential paths while maintaining spatial continuity. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of TrajLearn, benchmarking it against leading state-of-the-art approaches and meaningful baselines. The results indicate that TrajLearn achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of up to ~40% across multiple real-world trajectory datasets. In addition, we evaluated different prediction horizons (i.e., various values of $k$), conducted resolution sensitivity analysis, and performed ablation studies to assess the impact of key model components. Furthermore, we developed a novel algorithm to generate mixed-resolution maps by hierarchically subdividing hexagonal regions into finer segments within a specified observation area. This approach supports selective detailing, applying finer resolution to areas of interest or high activity (e.g., urban centers) while using coarser resolution for less significant regions (e.g., rural areas), effectively reducing data storage requirements and computational overhead. We promote reproducibility and adaptability by offering complete code, data, and detailed documentation with flexible configuration options for various applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems</p></details> |

In practice, an agent may initially follow a strategy to aim at one target but decide to switch to another midway. Such a strategy can be deceptive when the counterpart only has access to imperfect observations, which include heavily corrupted sensor noise and possible outliers, making it difficult to visually identify the agent's true intent. To counter deception and identify the true target, we utilize prior knowledge of the agent's dynamics and the imprecisely observed partial trajectory of the agent's states to dynamically update the estimation of the posterior probability of whether a deceptive switch has taken place. However, existing methods in the literature have not achieved effective deception identification within a reasonable computation time. We propose a set of outlier-robust change detection methods to track relevant change-related statistics efficiently, enabling the detection of deceptive strategies in hidden nonlinear dynamics with reasonable computational effort. The performance of the proposed framework is examined for Weapon-Target Assignment (WTA) detection under deceptive strategies using random simulations in the kinematics model with external forcing.</p></details> |  |

In this method, each control input between two consecutive events is a polynomial and its coefficients are chosen to minimize the error in approximating a continuous-time control signal. We design an event-triggering rule that guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of the tracking error and non-Zeno behavior of inter-event times. We illustrate our results through a suite of numerical simulations and experiments, which indicate that the number of events generated by the proposed controller is significantly less compared to that by a time-triggered controller or a event-triggered controller based on zero-order hold while guaranteeing similar tracking performance.</p></details> |  |

Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis for safety verification has demonstrated practical utility only when efficient evaluation of the Hamiltonian over a large state-time grid is possible. In this study, we introduce the concept of a data-driven Hamiltonian (DDH), which circumvents the need for an explicit dynamics model by relying only on mild prior knowledge (e.g., Lipschitz constants), thus enabling the construction of reachable sets directly from trajectory data. Recognizing that the Hamiltonian is the optimal inner product between a given costate and realizable state velocities, the DDH estimates the Hamiltonian using the worst-case realization of the velocity field based on the observed state trajectory data. This formulation ensures a conservative approximation of the true Hamiltonian for uncertain dynamics. The reachable set computed based on the DDH is also ensured to be a conservative approximation of the true reachable set. Next, we propose a data-efficient safe experiment framework for gradual expansion of safe sets using the DDH. This is achieved by iteratively conducting experiments within the computed data-driven safe set and updating the set using newly collected trajectory data. To demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, we showcase its effectiveness in safe flight envelope expansion for a tiltrotor vehicle transitioning from near-hover to forward flight.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the extended version of the article submitted to IEEE CDC 2025.

| **[Learning Lie Group Generators from Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03220v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the inverse problem of generator recovery in matrix Lie groups from discretized trajectories. Let $G$ be a real matrix Lie group and $\mathfrak{g} = \text{Lie}(G)$ its corresponding Lie algebra. A smooth trajectory $\gamma($t$)$ generated by a fixed Lie algebra element $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}$ follows the exponential flow $\gamma($t$) = g_0 \cdot \exp(t \xi)$. The central task addressed in this work is the reconstruction of such a latent generator $\xi$ from a discretized sequence of poses $ \{g_0, g_1, \dots, g_T\} \subset G$, sampled at uniform time intervals. This problem is formulated as a data-driven regression from normalized sequences of discrete Lie algebra increments $\log\left(g_{t}^{-1} g_{t+1}\right)$ to the constant generator $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}$.

| **[VL-TGS: Trajectory Generation and Selection using Vision Language Models in Mapless Outdoor Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02454v5)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a multi-modal trajectory generation and selection algorithm for real-world mapless outdoor navigation in human-centered environments. Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quattro: Transformer-Accelerated Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator Framework for Fast Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01806v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time optimal control remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, especially for nonlinear systems with stringent performance requirements. As one of the representative trajectory optimization algorithms, the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) faces limitations due to their inherently sequential computational nature, which restricts the efficiency and applicability of real-time control for robotic systems. While existing parallel implementations aim to overcome the above limitations, they typically demand additional computational iterations and high-performance hardware, leading to only modest practical improvements. In this paper, we introduce Quattro, a transformer-accelerated iLQR framework employing an algorithm-hardware co-design strategy to predict intermediate feedback and feedforward matrices. It facilitates effective parallel computations on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on cart-pole and quadrotor systems show an algorithm-level acceleration of up to 5.3$\times$ and 27$\times$ per iteration, respectively. When integrated into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, Quattro achieves overall speedups of 2.8$\times$ for the cart-pole and 17.8$\times$ for the quadrotor compared to the one that applies traditional iLQR. Transformer inference is deployed on FPGA to maximize performance, achieving further up to 20.8$\times$ speedup over prevalent embedded CPUs with over 11$\times$ power reduction than GPU and low hardware resource overhead.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often struggle to accurately capture this intricate structure from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data, particularly due to the lack of ground truth labels and the ambiguous, intertwined nature of fiber trajectories. We present a novel deep learning framework for unsupervised clustering of myocardial fibers, providing a data-driven approach to identifying distinct fiber bundles. We uniquely combine a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to capture local sequential information along fibers, with a Transformer autoencoder to learn global shape features, with pointwise incorporation of essential anatomical context. Clustering these representations using a density-based algorithm identifies 33 to 62 robust clusters, successfully capturing the subtle distinctions in fiber trajectories with varying levels of granularity. Our framework offers a new, flexible, and quantitative way to analyze myocardial structure, achieving a level of delineation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously achieved, with potential applications in improving surgical planning, characterizing disease-related remodeling, and ultimately, advancing personalized cardiac care.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Virtual Target Trajectory Prediction for Stochastic Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01851v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction of other vehicles is crucial for autonomous vehicles, with applications from missile guidance to UAV collision avoidance. Typically, target trajectories are assumed deterministic, but real-world aerial vehicles exhibit stochastic behavior, such as evasive maneuvers or gliders circling in thermals. This paper uses Conditional Normalizing Flows, an unsupervised Machine Learning technique, to learn and predict the stochastic behavior of targets of guided missiles using trajectory data. The trained model predicts the distribution of future target positions based on initial conditions and parameters of the dynamics. Samples from this distribution are clustered using a time series k-means algorithm to generate representative trajectories, termed virtual targets. The method is fast and target-agnostic, requiring only training data in the form of target trajectories. Thus, it serves as a drop-in replacement for deterministic trajectory predictions in guidance laws and path planning. Simulated scenarios demonstrate the approach's effectiveness for aerial vehicles with random maneuvers, bridging the gap between deterministic predictions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>will ...</summary><p>will be submitted to Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics</p></details> |

Point-based solutions rely on position annotations of WiFi fingerprints. Trajectory-based solutions, however, require end-position annotations of WiFi trajectories, where a WiFi trajectory is a multivariate time series of signal features. A trajectory dataset is much larger than a pointwise dataset as the number of potential trajectories in a field may grow exponentially with respect to the size of the field. This work presents a semi-self representation learning solution, where a large dataset $C$ of crowdsourced unlabeled WiFi trajectories can be automatically labeled by a much smaller dataset $\tilde C$ of labeled WiFi trajectories. The size of $\tilde C$ only needs to be proportional to the size of the physical field, while the unlabeled $C$ could be much larger. This is made possible through a novel ``cut-and-flip'' augmentation scheme based on the meet-in-the-middle paradigm. A two-stage learning consisting of trajectory embedding followed by endpoint embedding is proposed for the unlabeled $C$. Then the learned representations are labeled by $\tilde C$ and connected to a neural-based localization network. The result, while delivering promising accuracy, significantly relieves the burden of human annotations for trajectory-based localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VTC2025-Spring</p></details> |
| **[ACTIVE: Continuous Similarity Search for Vessel Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01142v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Publicly available vessel trajectory data is emitted continuously from the global AIS system. Continuous trajectory similarity search on this data has applications in, e.g., maritime navigation and safety. Existing proposals typically assume an offline setting and focus on finding similarities between complete trajectories. Such proposals are less effective when applied to online scenarios, where similarity comparisons must be performed continuously as new trajectory data arrives and trajectories evolve. We therefore propose a real-time continuous trajectory similarity search method for vessels (ACTIVE). We introduce a novel similarity measure, object-trajectory real-time distance, that emphasizes the anticipated future movement trends of vessels, enabling more predictive and forward-looking comparisons. Next, we propose a segment-based vessel trajectory index structure that organizes historical trajectories into smaller and manageable segments, facilitating accelerated similarity computations. Leveraging this index, we propose an efficient continuous similar trajectory search (CSTS) algorithm together with a variety of search space pruning strategies that reduce unnecessary computations during the continuous similarity search, thereby further improving efficiency. Extensive experiments on two large real-world AIS datasets offer evidence that ACTIVE is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods considerably. ACTIVE significantly reduces index construction costs and index size while achieving a 70% reduction in terms of query time and a 60% increase in terms of hit rate.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we aim to learn the trajectory prediction model by using broad out-of-domain data to improve its performance and generalization ability. Trajectory model is designed to predict any-point trajectories in the current frame given an instruction and can provide detailed control guidance for robotic policy learning. To handle the diverse out-of-domain data distribution, we propose a sparsely-gated MoE (\textbf{Top-1} gating strategy) architecture for trajectory model, coined as \textbf{Tra-MoE}. The sparse activation design enables good balance between parameter cooperation and specialization, effectively benefiting from large-scale out-of-domain data while maintaining constant FLOPs per token. In addition, we further introduce an adaptive policy conditioning technique by learning 2D mask representations for predicted trajectories, which is explicitly aligned with image observations to guide action prediction more flexibly. We perform extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world scenarios to verify the effectiveness of Tra-MoE and adaptive policy conditioning technique. We also conduct a comprehensive empirical study to train Tra-MoE, demonstrating that our Tra-MoE consistently exhibits superior performance compared to the dense baseline model, even when the latter is scaled to match Tra-MoE's parameter count.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

| **[Timely Trajectory Reconstruction in Finite Buffer Remote Tracking Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00849v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote tracking systems play a critical role in applications such as IoT, monitoring, surveillance and healthcare. In such systems, maintaining both real-time state awareness (for online decision making) and accurate reconstruction of historical trajectories (for offline post-processing) are essential. While the Age of Information (AoI) metric has been extensively studied as a measure of freshness, it does not capture the accuracy with which past trajectories can be reconstructed. In this work, we investigate reconstruction error as a complementary metric to AoI, addressing the trade-off between timely updates and historical accuracy. Specifically, we consider three policies, each prioritizing different aspects of information management: Keep-Old, Keep-Fresh, and our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy. We compare these policies in terms of impact on both AoI and reconstruction error in a remote tracking system with a finite buffer. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of queueing behavior, we demonstrate that while the Keep-Fresh policy minimizes AoI, it does not necessarily minimize reconstruction error. In contrast, our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy dynamically adjusts packet retention decisions based on generation times, achieving a balance between AoI and reconstruction error. Our results provide key insights into the design of efficient update policies for resource-constrained IoT networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Behavior and Lane Constraints Guided Trajectory Prediction Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21477v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction, as a critical component of autonomous driving systems, has attracted the attention of many researchers. Existing prediction algorithms focus on extracting more detailed scene features or selecting more reasonable trajectory destinations. However, in the face of dynamic and evolving future movements of the target vehicle, these algorithms cannot provide a fine-grained and continuous description of future behaviors and lane constraints, which degrades the prediction accuracy. To address this challenge, we present BLNet, a novel dualstream architecture that synergistically integrates behavioral intention recognition and lane constraint modeling through parallel attention mechanisms. The framework generates fine-grained behavior state queries (capturing spatial-temporal movement patterns) and lane queries (encoding lane topology constraints), supervised by two auxiliary losses, respectively. Subsequently, a two-stage decoder first produces trajectory proposals, then performs point-level refinement by jointly incorporating both the continuity of passed lanes and future motion features. Extensive experiments on two large datasets, nuScenes and Argoverse, show that our network exhibits significant performance gains over existing direct regression and goal-based algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

The proposed system employs multiple UAVs equipped with dual-functional radar-communication capabilities to simultaneously perform target sensing and provide communication services to users. We formulate a joint optimization problem that aims to maximize the sum rate of users while maintaining target sensing performance through coordinated beamforming and UAV trajectory design. To address this challenging non-convex problem, we develop a block coordinated descent (BCD)-based iterative algorithm that decomposes the original problem into tractable subproblems. Then, the beamforming design problem is addressed using fractional programming, while the UAV trajectory is refined through the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization approach achieves significant performance improvements in both communication throughput and sensing accuracy compared to conventional, separated designs. We also show that proper coordination of multiple UAVs through optimized trajectories and beamforming patterns can effectively balance the tradeoff between sensing and communication objectives.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

To this end, an accurate prediction of dynamic obstacle trajectories is vital. Traditional approaches to trajectory prediction face limitations in generalizability and often fail to account for the intentions of other vessels. While recent research has considered incorporating the intentions of dynamic obstacles, these efforts are typically based on the own-ship's interpretation of the situation. The current state-of-the-art in this area is a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model, which infers target vessel intentions by considering multiple underlying causes and allowing for different interpretations of the situation by different vessels. However, since its inception, there have not been any significant structural improvements to this model. In this paper, we propose enhancing the DBN model by incorporating considerations for grounding hazards and vessel waypoint information. The proposed model is validated using real vessel encounters extracted from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.</p></details> |  |

Although mmWaves can offer a notably high data rate, their high penetration and propagation losses mean that line of sight (LoS) is necessary for effective communication. Due to the presence of obstacles and user mobility, UAV trajectory planning plays a crucial role in improving system performance. In this work, we propose a novel computational geometry-based trajectory planning scheme by considering the user mobility, the priority of the delay sensitive ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) and the high throughput requirements of the enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) traffic. Specifically, we use geometric tools like Apollonius circle and minimum enclosing ball of balls to find the optimal position of the UAV that supports uninterrupted connections to the URLLC users and maximizes the aggregate throughput of the eMBB users. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate the benefits of the suggested approach over an existing state of the art benchmark scheme in terms of sum throughput obtained by URLLC and eMBB users.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to a reputed conference</p></details> |

This article presents an extension of the HMPC formulation to track periodic harmonic/sinusoidal references and discusses its use for tracking arbitrary trajectories. The proposed formulation inherits the benefits of its predecessor, namely its good performance and large domain of attraction when using small prediction horizons, and that the complexity of its optimization problem does not depend on the period of the reference.

| **[Aligning Diffusion Model with Problem Constraints for Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00342v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently emerged as effective generative frameworks for trajectory optimization, capable of producing high-quality and diverse solutions. However, training these models in a purely data-driven manner without explicit incorporation of constraint information often leads to violations of critical constraints, such as goal-reaching, collision avoidance, and adherence to system dynamics. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that aligns diffusion models explicitly with problem-specific constraints, drawing insights from the Dynamic Data-driven Application Systems (DDDAS) framework. Our approach introduces a hybrid loss function that explicitly measures and penalizes constraint violations during training. Furthermore, by statistically analyzing how constraint violations evolve throughout the diffusion steps, we develop a re-weighting strategy that aligns predicted violations to ground truth statistics at each diffusion step. Evaluated on a tabletop manipulation and a two-car reach-avoid problem, our constraint-aligned diffusion model significantly reduces constraint violations compared to traditional diffusion models, while maintaining the quality of trajectory solutions. This approach is well-suited for integration into the DDDAS framework for efficient online trajectory adaptation as new environmental data becomes available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Velocity and Acceleration: Self-Supervised Motion Consistency for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24272v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human motion is crucial for accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction. Conventional methods typically rely on supervised learning, where ground-truth labels are directly optimized against predicted trajectories. This amplifies the limitations caused by long-tailed data distributions, making it difficult for the model to capture abnormal behaviors. In this work, we propose a self-supervised pedestrian trajectory prediction framework that explicitly models position, velocity, and acceleration. We leverage velocity and acceleration information to enhance position prediction through feature injection and a self-supervised motion consistency mechanism. Our model hierarchically injects velocity features into the position stream. Acceleration features are injected into the velocity stream. This enables the model to predict position, velocity, and acceleration jointly. From the predicted position, we compute corresponding pseudo velocity and acceleration, allowing the model to learn from data-generated pseudo labels and thus achieve self-supervised learning. We further design a motion consistency evaluation strategy grounded in physical principles; it selects the most reasonable predicted motion trend by comparing it with historical dynamics and uses this trend to guide and constrain trajectory generation. We conduct experiments on the ETH-UCY and Stanford Drone datasets, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions with Diffuser for Safety-Critical Trajectory Planning at Signal-Free Intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00162v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning safe and efficient trajectories through signal-free intersections presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in dynamic, multi-task environments with unpredictable interactions and an increased possibility of conflicts. This study aims to address these challenges by developing a unified, robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety and efficiency across three distinct intersection movements: left-turn, right-turn, and straight-ahead. Existing methods often struggle to reliably ensure safety and effectively learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in such environments. This study proposes a safety-critical planning method that integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF) with a diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser (DSC-Diffuser). The DSC-Diffuser leverages task-guided planning to enhance efficiency, allowing the simultaneous learning of multiple driving tasks from real-world expert demonstrations. Moreover, the incorporation of goal-oriented constraints significantly reduces displacement errors, ensuring precise trajectory execution. To further ensure driving safety in dynamic environments, the proposed DHOCBF framework dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of surrounding vehicles, offering enhanced adaptability and reduce the conservatism compared to traditional control barrier functions. Validity evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical simulations, demonstrate its robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle velocities, sizes, uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining driving safety across a wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios. Comprehensive performance evaluations demonstrate that DSC-Diffuser generates realistic, stable, and generalizable policies, providing flexibility and reliable safety assurance in complex multi-task driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 fi...</summary><p>11 figures, 5 tables, 15 pages</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Automated Driving using Target Funnels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23795v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-driving vehicles rely on sensory input to monitor their surroundings and continuously adapt to the most likely future road course. Predictive trajectory planning is based on snapshots of the (uncertain) road course as a key input. Under noisy perception data, estimates of the road course can vary significantly, leading to indecisive and erratic steering behavior. To overcome this issue, this paper introduces a predictive trajectory planning algorithm with a novel objective function: instead of targeting a single reference trajectory based on the most likely road course, tracking a series of target reference sets, called a target funnel, is considered. The proposed planning algorithm integrates probabilistic information about the road course, and thus implicitly considers regular updates to road perception. Our solution is assessed in a case study using real driving data collected from a prototype vehicle. The results demonstrate that the algorithm maintains tracking accuracy and substantially reduces undesirable steering commands in the presence of noisy road perception, achieving a 56% reduction in input costs compared to a certainty equivalent formulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to European Control Conference 2025 (ECC25)</p></details> |

These high-resolution, language-guided synthesized images are essential for the explainability of disease or exploring causal relationships. However, their potential for disentangling and controlling latent factors of variation in specialized domains like medical imaging remains under-explored. In this work, we present the first investigation of the power of pre-trained vision-language foundation models, once fine-tuned on medical image datasets, to perform latent disentanglement for factorized medical image generation and interpolation. Through extensive experiments on chest X-ray and skin datasets, we illustrate that fine-tuned, language-guided Stable Diffusion inherently learns to factorize key attributes for image generation, such as the patient's anatomical structures or disease diagnostic features. We devise a framework to identify, isolate, and manipulate key attributes through latent space trajectory traversal of generative models, facilitating precise control over medical image synthesis.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, existing datasets fall short in capturing the diversity and dynamics of VRU behaviors, making it difficult to meet the research demands of complex traffic environments. To address this gap, this study developed the OnSiteVRU datasets, which cover a variety of scenarios, including intersections, road segments, and urban villages. These datasets provide trajectory data for motor vehicles, electric bicycles, and human-powered bicycles, totaling approximately 17,429 trajectories with a precision of 0.04 seconds. The datasets integrate both aerial-view natural driving data and onboard real-time dynamic detection data, along with environmental information such as traffic signals, obstacles, and real-time maps, enabling a comprehensive reconstruction of interaction events. The results demonstrate that VRU\_Data outperforms traditional datasets in terms of VRU density and scene coverage, offering a more comprehensive representation of VRU behavioral characteristics. This provides critical support for traffic flow modeling, trajectory prediction, and autonomous driving virtual testing.

VT migration is an effective way that migrates the VT when the locations of physical entities keep changing to maintain seamless immersive VT services. However, an efficient VT migration is challenging due to the rapid movement of vehicles, dynamic workloads of Roadside Units (RSUs), and heterogeneous resources of the RSUs. To achieve efficient migration decisions and a minimum latency for the VT migration, we propose a multi-agent split Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework combined with spatio-temporal trajectory generation. In this framework, multiple split DRL agents utilize split architecture to efficiently determine VT migration decisions. Furthermore, we propose a spatio-temporal trajectory generation algorithm based on trajectory datasets and road network data to simulate vehicle trajectories, enhancing the generalization of the proposed scheme for managing VT migration in dynamic network environments. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only enhances the Quality of Experience (QoE) by 29% but also reduces the computational parameter count by approximately 25% while maintaining similar performances, enhancing users' immersive experiences in vehicular metaverses.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods also generally predict agents' states without offering any state-wise measure of uncertainty. Moreover, popular multi-modal sampling methods lack any error probability estimates for each generated scene under the same prior observations, making it difficult to rank the predictions during inference time. We introduce U2Diff, a \textbf{unified} diffusion model designed to handle trajectory completion while providing state-wise \textbf{uncertainty} estimates jointly. This uncertainty estimation is achieved by augmenting the simple denoising loss with the negative log-likelihood of the predicted noise and propagating latent space uncertainty to the real state space. Additionally, we incorporate a Rank Neural Network in post-processing to enable \textbf{error probability} estimation for each generated mode, demonstrating a strong correlation with the error relative to ground truth. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in trajectory completion and forecasting across four challenging sports datasets (NBA, Basketball-U, Football-U, Soccer-U), highlighting the effectiveness of uncertainty and error probability estimation.

We present streaming algorithms for two such problems under the Fr\'{e}chet distance $d_F$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for some constant $d \geq 2$. Consider a polygonal curve $\tau$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in a stream. We present a streaming algorithm that, for any $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$ and $\delta > 0$, produces a curve $\sigma$ such that $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon)\delta$ and $|\sigma|\le 2\,\mathrm{opt}-2$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far, and $\mathrm{opt} = \min\{|\sigma'|: d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i])\le \delta\}$. Let $\alpha = 2(d-1){\lfloor d/2 \rfloor}^2 + d$. The working storage is $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$. Each vertex is processed in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$ time for $d \geq 4$ . Thus, the whole $\tau$ can be simplified in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}|\tau|\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time. Ignoring polynomial factors in $1/\varepsilon$, this running time is a factor $|\tau|$ faster than the best static algorithm that offers the same guarantees. We present another streaming algorithm that, for any integer $k \geq 2$ and any $\varepsilon \in (0,\frac{1}{17})$, maintains a curve $\sigma$ such that $|\sigma| \leq 2k-2$ and $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon) \cdot \min\{d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i]): |\sigma'| \leq k\}$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far.

| **[Next-Best-Trajectory Planning of Robot Manipulators for Effective Observation and Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22588v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual observation of objects is essential for many robotic applications, such as object reconstruction and manipulation, navigation, and scene understanding. Machine learning algorithms constitute the state-of-the-art in many fields but require vast data sets, which are costly and time-intensive to collect. Automated strategies for observation and exploration are crucial to enhance the efficiency of data gathering. Therefore, a novel strategy utilizing the Next-Best-Trajectory principle is developed for a robot manipulator operating in dynamic environments. Local trajectories are generated to maximize the information gained from observations along the path while avoiding collisions. We employ a voxel map for environment modeling and utilize raycasting from perspectives around a point of interest to estimate the information gain. A global ergodic trajectory planner provides an optional reference trajectory to the local planner, improving exploration and helping to avoid local minima. To enhance computational efficiency, raycasting for estimating the information gain in the environment is executed in parallel on the graphics processing unit. Benchmark results confirm the efficiency of the parallelization, while real-world experiments demonstrate the strategy's effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Robust Offline Imitation Learning Through State-level Trajectory Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22524v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning (IL) has proven effective for enabling robots to acquire visuomotor skills through expert demonstrations. However, traditional IL methods are limited by their reliance on high-quality, often scarce, expert data, and suffer from covariate shift. To address these challenges, recent advances in offline IL have incorporated suboptimal, unlabeled datasets into the training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance policy learning from mixed-quality offline datasets by leveraging task-relevant trajectory fragments and rich environmental dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a state-based search framework that stitches state-action pairs from imperfect demonstrations, generating more diverse and informative training trajectories. Experimental results on standard IL benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks showcase that our proposed method significantly improves both generalization and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement learning for efficient and robust multi-setpoint and multi-trajectory tracking in bioprocesses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22409v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient and robust bioprocess control is essential for maximizing performance and adaptability in advanced biotechnological systems. In this work, we present a reinforcement-learning framework for multi-setpoint and multi-trajectory tracking. Tracking multiple setpoints and time-varying trajectories in reinforcement learning is challenging due to the complexity of balancing multiple objectives, a difficulty further exacerbated by system uncertainties such as uncertain initial conditions and stochastic dynamics. This challenge is relevant, e.g., in bioprocesses involving microbial consortia, where precise control over population compositions is required. We introduce a novel return function based on multiplicative reciprocal saturation functions, which explicitly couples reward gains to the simultaneous satisfaction of multiple references. Through a case study involving light-mediated cybergenetic growth control in microbial consortia, we demonstrate via computational experiments that our approach achieves faster convergence, improved stability, and superior control compliance compared to conventional quadratic-cost-based return functions. Moreover, our method enables tuning of the saturation function's parameters, shaping the learning process and policy updates. By incorporating system uncertainties, our framework also demonstrates robustness, a key requirement in industrial bioprocessing. Overall, this work advances reinforcement-learning-based control strategies in bioprocess engineering, with implications in the broader field of process and systems engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Follow Your Motion: A Generic Temporal Consistency Portrait Editing Framework with Trajectory Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22225v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained conditional diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable potential in image editing. However, they often face challenges with temporal consistency, particularly in the talking head domain, where continuous changes in facial expressions intensify the level of difficulty. These issues stem from the independent editing of individual images and the inherent loss of temporal continuity during the editing process. In this paper, we introduce Follow Your Motion (FYM), a generic framework for maintaining temporal consistency in portrait editing. Specifically, given portrait images rendered by a pre-trained 3D Gaussian Splatting model, we first develop a diffusion model that intuitively and inherently learns motion trajectory changes at different scales and pixel coordinates, from the first frame to each subsequent frame. This approach ensures that temporally inconsistent edited avatars inherit the motion information from the rendered avatars. Secondly, to maintain fine-grained expression temporal consistency in talking head editing, we propose a dynamic re-weighted attention mechanism. This mechanism assigns higher weight coefficients to landmark points in space and dynamically updates these weights based on landmark loss, achieving more consistent and refined facial expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of temporal consistency and can be used to optimize and compensate for temporally inconsistent outputs in a range of applications, such as text-driven editing, relighting, and various other applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://anonymous-hub1127.github.io/FYM.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Multi-modal Knowledge Distillation-based Human Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22201v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory forecasting is crucial in various applications such as autonomous driving and mobile robot navigation. In such applications, camera-based perception enables the extraction of additional modalities (human pose, text) to enhance prediction accuracy. Indeed, we find that textual descriptions play a crucial role in integrating additional modalities into a unified understanding. However, online extraction of text requires the use of VLM, which may not be feasible for resource-constrained systems. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework: a student model with limited modality is distilled from a teacher model trained with full range of modalities. The comprehensive knowledge of a teacher model trained with trajectory, human pose, and text is distilled into a student model using only trajectory or human pose as a sole supplement. In doing so, we separately distill the core locomotion insights from intra-agent multi-modality and inter-agent interaction. Our generalizable framework is validated with two state-of-the-art models across three datasets on both ego-view (JRDB, SIT) and BEV-view (ETH/UCY) setups, utilizing both annotated and VLM-generated text captions. Distilled student models show consistent improvement in all prediction metrics for both full and instantaneous observations, improving up to ~13%.

However, developing high-performance ASR models remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages like Arabic, due to the scarcity of large, labeled speech datasets, which are costly and labor-intensive to produce. In this work, we employ weakly supervised learning to train an Arabic ASR model using the Conformer architecture. Our model is trained from scratch on 15,000 hours of weakly annotated speech data covering both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Dialectal Arabic (DA), eliminating the need for costly manual transcriptions. Despite the absence of human-verified labels, our approach attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, exceeding all previous efforts in the field of Arabic ASR on the standard benchmarks. By demonstrating the effectiveness of weak supervision as a scalable, cost-efficient alternative to traditional supervised approaches, paving the way for improved ASR systems in low resource settings.</p></details> |  |

This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zhao-ht/BioMaze.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOS: Towards Effective Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection through Mixture-of-Experts Tuning of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12234v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contract vulnerabilities pose significant security risks to blockchain systems, potentially leading to severe financial losses. Existing methods face several limitations: (1) Program analysis-based approaches rely on predefined patterns, lacking flexibility for new vulnerability types; (2) Deep learning-based methods lack explanations; (3) Large language model-based approaches suffer from high false positives. We propose MOS, a smart contract vulnerability detection framework based on mixture-of-experts tuning (MOE-Tuning) of large language models. First, we conduct continual pre-training on a large-scale smart contract dataset to provide domain-enhanced initialization. Second, we construct a high-quality MOE-Tuning dataset through a multi-stage pipeline combining LLM generation and expert verification for reliable explanations. Third, we design a vulnerability-aware routing mechanism that activates the most relevant expert networks by analyzing code features and their matching degree with experts. Finally, we extend the feed-forward layers into multiple parallel expert networks, each specializing in specific vulnerability patterns. We employ a dual-objective loss function: one for optimizing detection and explanation performance, and another for ensuring reasonable distribution of vulnerability types to experts through entropy calculation. Experiments show that MOS significantly outperforms existing methods with average improvements of 6.32% in F1 score and 4.80% in accuracy. The vulnerability explanations achieve positive ratings (scores of 3-4 on a 4-point scale) of 82.96%, 85.21% and 94.58% for correctness, completeness, and conciseness through human and LLM evaluation.</p></details> |  |

These capabilities have primarily been demonstrated within the left-to-right autoregressive (AR) generation paradigm. In contrast, non-autoregressive paradigms based on diffusion generate text in a coarse-to-fine manner. Although recent diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have achieved competitive language modeling performance compared to their AR counterparts, it remains unclear if dLLMs can also leverage recent advances in LLM reasoning. To this end, we propose d1, a framework to adapt pre-trained masked dLLMs into reasoning models via a combination of supervised finetuning (SFT) and RL. Specifically, we develop and extend techniques to improve reasoning in pretrained dLLMs: (a) we utilize a masked SFT technique to distill knowledge and instill self-improvement behavior directly from existing datasets, and (b) we introduce a novel critic-free, policy-gradient based RL algorithm called diffu-GRPO. Through empirical studies, we investigate the performance of different post-training recipes on multiple mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks. We find that d1 yields the best performance and significantly improves performance of a state-of-the-art dLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, project page at https://dllm-reasoning.github.io/</p></details> |

This study explores the potential of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM), to automate the generation of personality situational judgment tests (PSJTs) in Chinese. Traditional SJT development is labor-intensive and prone to biases, while GPT-4 offers a scalable, efficient alternative. Two studies were conducted: Study 1 evaluated the impact of prompt design and temperature settings on content validity, finding that optimized prompts with a temperature of 1.0 produced creative and accurate items. Study 2 assessed the psychometric properties of GPT-4-generated PSJTs, revealing that they demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity, surpassing the performance of manually developed tests in measuring the Big Five personality traits. This research highlights GPT-4's effectiveness in developing high-quality PSJTs, providing a scalable and innovative method for psychometric test development. These findings expand the possibilities of automatic item generation and the application of LLMs in psychology, and offer practical implications for streamlining test development processes in resource-limited settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Psychological Methods. 56 pages (main text), 12 pages (appendix), and 5 figures</p></details> |

But what -- if anything -- do LLMs actually know? In this paper, I argue that LLMs can acquire tacit knowledge as defined by Martin Davies (1990). Whereas Davies himself denies that neural networks can acquire tacit knowledge, I demonstrate that certain architectural features of LLMs satisfy the constraints of semantic description, syntactic structure, and causal systematicity. Thus, tacit knowledge may serve as a conceptual framework for describing, explaining, and intervening on LLMs and their behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Philosophy of Science</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a method to improve LLM-based long-document translation through targeted fine-tuning on high-quality document-level data, which we curate and introduce as DocBlocks. Our approach supports multiple translation paradigms, including direct document-to-document and chunk-level translation, by integrating instructions both with and without surrounding context. This enables models to better capture cross-sentence dependencies while maintaining strong sentence-level translation performance. Experimental results show that incorporating multiple translation paradigms improves document-level translation quality and inference speed compared to prompting and agent-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, work-in-progress</p></details> |

To mitigate such hallucinations, we introduce Efficient Contrastive Decoding (ECD), a simple method that leverages probabilistic hallucination detection to shift the output distribution towards contextually accurate answers at inference time. By contrasting token probabilities and hallucination scores, ECD subtracts hallucinated concepts from the original distribution, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Notably, our proposed method can be applied to any open-source LVLM and does not require additional LVLM training. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and across different LVLMs. Our experiments show that ECD effectively mitigates hallucinations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with respect to performance on LVLM benchmarks and computation time.</p></details> |  |

Large terrestrial mammalian herbivores are keystone species as their activity not only has deep effects on soils, plants, and animals, but also shapes landscapes, as large herbivores act as allogenic ecosystem engineers. One key landscape feature that indicates intense herbivore activity and potentially impacts biodiversity is the formation of grazing trails. Grazing trails are formed by the continuous trampling activity of large herbivores that can produce complex networks of tracks of bare soil. Here, we evaluated different algorithms based on machine learning techniques to identify grazing trails. Our goal is to automatically detect potential areas with intense herbivory activity, which might be beneficial for conservation and management plans. We have applied five semantic segmentation methods combined with fourteen encoders aimed at mapping grazing trails on aerial images. Our results indicate that in most cases the chosen methodology successfully mapped the trails, although there were a few instances where the actual trail structure was underestimated. The UNet architecture with the MambaOut encoder was the best architecture for mapping trails. The proposed approach could be applied to develop tools for mapping and monitoring temporal changes in these landscape structures to support habitat conservation and land management programs. This is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that competitive image segmentation results are obtained for the detection and delineation of trails of large herbivorous mammals.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figures.

To address these limitations, we propose a self-alignment framework that enables LVLMs to learn from their own errors. Our proposed framework first obtains a training set of preferred and non-preferred response pairs, where non-preferred responses are generated by incorporating common error patterns that often occur due to inadequate spatio-temporal understanding, spurious correlations between co-occurring concepts, and over-reliance on linguistic cues while neglecting the vision modality, among others. To facilitate self-alignment of LVLMs with the constructed preferred and non-preferred response pairs, we introduce Refined Regularized Preference Optimization (RRPO), a novel preference optimization method that utilizes sub-sequence-level refined rewards and token-wise KL regularization to address the limitations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We demonstrate that RRPO achieves more precise alignment and more stable training compared to DPO. Our experiments and analysis validate the effectiveness of our approach across diverse video tasks, including video hallucination, short- and long-video understanding, and fine-grained temporal reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, annotating RS images with rich linguistic semantics at scale demands expertise in RS and substantial human labor, making it costly and often impractical. In this study, we propose a workflow that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate multimodal datasets with semantically rich captions at scale from plain OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for images sourced from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This approach facilitates the generation of paired remote sensing data and can be readily scaled up using openly available data. Within this framework, we present RSTeller, a multimodal dataset comprising over 1.3 million RS images, each accompanied by two descriptive captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSTeller enhances the performance of multiple existing vision language models for RS scene understanding through continual pre-training. Our methodology significantly reduces the manual effort and expertise needed for annotating remote sensing imagery while democratizing access to high-quality annotated data. This advancement fosters progress in visual language modeling and encourages broader participation in remote sensing research and applications.

However, in creative or exploratory contexts, these "mistakes" may represent unexpected avenues for innovation. We introduce Purposefully Induced Psychosis (PIP), a novel approach that amplifies LLM hallucinations for imaginative tasks such as speculative fiction, interactive storytelling, and mixed-reality simulations. Drawing on Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, where Pip's "madness" reveals profound insight, we reframe hallucinations as a source of computational imagination rather than a flaw. Our method fine-tunes LLMs to encourage speculative, metaphorical, and surreal outputs - hallucinations that are useful when factual accuracy is not the chief objective. Inspired by the consensual illusions of theater and stage magic, PIP situates these creative missteps in contexts where users willingly suspend disbelief, thereby transforming "errors" into catalysts for new ways of thinking. We discuss potential applications, design principles for ensuring user consent, preliminary observations, and implications for broader AI ethics and human-AI collaboration.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

Security professionals are increasingly burdened by the sheer volume and complexity of information, creating an urgent need for effective tools to navigate, synthesize, and act on large-scale data to counter evolving threats proactively. However, conventional threat intelligence tools often fail to scale with the dynamic nature of this data and lack the adaptability to support diverse threat intelligence tasks. In this work, we introduce CYLENS, a cyber threat intelligence copilot powered by large language models (LLMs). CYLENS is designed to assist security professionals throughout the entire threat management lifecycle, supporting threat attribution, contextualization, detection, correlation, prioritization, and remediation. To ensure domain expertise, CYLENS integrates knowledge from 271,570 threat reports into its model parameters and incorporates six specialized NLP modules to enhance reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, CYLENS can be customized to meet the unique needs of different or ganizations, underscoring its adaptability. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that CYLENS consistently outperforms industry-leading LLMs and state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents. By detailing its design, development, and evaluation, this work provides a blueprint for leveraging LLMs to address complex, data-intensive cybersecurity challenges.</p></details> |  |

Traditional machine learning models have shown promise in analyzing longitudinal medical records for this task. However, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer an opportunity to enhance prediction performance by leveraging their ability to process long textual data and their inherent prior knowledge across diverse tasks. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of Open AI's GPT-4o LLM in predicting drug overdose events using patients' longitudinal insurance claims records. We evaluate its performance in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings, comparing them to strong traditional machine learning methods as baselines. Our results show that LLMs not only outperform traditional models in certain settings but can also predict overdose risk in a zero-shot setting without task-specific training. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in clinical decision support, particularly for drug overdose risk prediction.</p></details> |  |

A Survey on Test-Time Scaling in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24235v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As enthusiasm for scaling computation (data and parameters) in the pretraining era gradually diminished, test-time scaling (TTS), also referred to as ``test-time computing'' has emerged as a prominent research focus. Recent studies demonstrate that TTS can further elicit the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling significant breakthroughs not only in specialized reasoning tasks, such as mathematics and coding, but also in general tasks like open-ended Q&A. However, despite the explosion of recent efforts in this area, there remains an urgent need for a comprehensive survey offering a systemic understanding. To fill this gap, we propose a unified, multidimensional framework structured along four core dimensions of TTS research: what to scale, how to scale, where to scale, and how well to scale. Building upon this taxonomy, we conduct an extensive review of methods, application scenarios, and assessment aspects, and present an organized decomposition that highlights the unique functional roles of individual techniques within the broader TTS landscape. From this analysis, we distill the major developmental trajectories of TTS to date and offer hands-on guidelines for practical deployment. Furthermore, we identify several open challenges and offer insights into promising future directions, including further scaling, clarifying the functional essence of techniques, generalizing to more tasks, and more attributions.

Experimental results demonstrate that RoboMorph successfully generates nontrivial robots optimized for different terrains while showcasing improvements in robot morphology over successive evolutions.

Computing extraction probabilities for individual sequences provides finer-grained information than has been studied in prior benchmarking work. We re-analyze the effects of decoding schemes, model sizes, prefix lengths, partial sequence leakages, and token positions to uncover new insights that were not possible in previous works due to their choice of metrics. We perform this study on two pre-trained models, Llama and OPT, trained on the Common Crawl and The Pile respectively. We discover that 1) Extraction Rate, the predominant metric used in prior quantification work, underestimates the threat of leakage of training data in randomized LLMs by as much as 2.14X. 2) Although on average, larger models and longer prefixes can extract more data, this is not true for a substantial portion of individual sequences. 30.4-41.5% of our sequences are easier to extract with either shorter prefixes or smaller models. 3) Contrary to previous beliefs, partial leakage in commonly used decoding schemes like top-k and top-p is not easier than leaking verbatim training data. The aim of this work is to encourage the adoption of this metric for future work on quantification of training data extraction.</p></details> |  |

It involves artificially injecting specific failures into a distributed system and observing its behavior in response. Based on the observation, the system can be proactively improved to handle those failures. Recent CE tools implement the automated execution of predefined CE experiments. However, defining these experiments and improving the system based on the experimental results still remain manual. To reduce the costs of the manual operations, we propose ChaosEater, a system for automating the entire CE operations with Large Language Models (LLMs). It predefines the agentic workflow according to a systematic CE cycle and assigns subdivided operations within the workflow to LLMs. ChaosEater targets CE for Kubernetes systems, which are managed through code (i.e., Infrastructure as Code). Therefore, the LLMs in ChaosEater perform software engineering tasks to complete CE cycles, including requirement definition, code generation, debugging, and testing. We evaluate ChaosEater through case studies on both small and large Kubernetes systems. The results demonstrate that it stably completes reasonable single CE cycles with significantly low time and monetary costs.

| **[Enumeration of Bases in Matroid with Exponentially Large Ground Set](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11728v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When we deal with a matroid ${\mathcal M}=(U,{\mathcal I})$, we usually assume that it is implicitly given by means of the membership (MEM) oracle. Many existing efficient algorithms run in polynomial time with respect to $|U|$ and the running time of the MEM-oracle. However, they are not efficient any more when $U$ is exponentially large in some context. In this paper, we study two problems of enumerating bases in such matroids. First, we present an incremental-polynomial algorithm that enumerates all minimum-weighted bases, where the bounding polynomial does not depend on $|U|$. To design the algorithm, we assume two oracles other than the MEM-oracle: the MinB-oracle that returns a minimum basis and the REL-oracle that returns a relevant element one by one in non-decreasing order of weight. The proposed algorithm is applicable to enumeration of minimum bases of binary matroids from cycle space, path space and cut space, all of which have exponentially large $U$ with respect to a given graph. The highlight in this context is that, to design the REL-oracle for cut space, we develop the first polynomial-delay algorithm that enumerates all relevant cuts of a given graph in non-decreasing order of weight. Finally, we present a polynomial-delay algorithm that enumerates all sets of linearly independent $r$-dimensional $r$ vectors over $\mathit{GF}(2)$. Using the algorithm, we can enumerate all unweighted bases of a binary matroid such that elements are closed under addition, in polynomial-delay with respect to the matroid rank $r$.</p></details> |  |

Compared to approaches predicated on GUI metadata, which are platform-dependent and vulnerable to implementation variations, vision-based approaches offer broader applicability. In this vision-based paradigm, the GUI instruction grounding, which maps user instruction to the location of corresponding element on the given screenshot, remains a critical challenge, particularly due to limited public training dataset and resource-intensive manual instruction data annotation. In this paper, we delve into unexplored challenges in this task including element-to-screen ratio, unbalanced element type, and implicit instruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale data synthesis pipeline UI-E2I-Synth for generating varying complex instruction datasets using GPT-4o instead of human annotators. Furthermore, we propose a new GUI instruction grounding benchmark UI-I2E-Bench, which is designed to address the limitations of existing benchmarks by incorporating diverse annotation aspects. Our model, trained on the synthesized data, achieves superior performance in GUI instruction grounding, demonstrating the advancements of proposed data synthesis pipeline. The proposed benchmark, accompanied by extensive analyses, provides practical insights for future research in GUI grounding. We will release corresponding artifacts at https://colmon46.github.io/i2e-bench-leaderboard/ .</p></details> |  |
| **[A New Paradigm of User-Centric Wireless Communication Driven by Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11696v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The next generation of wireless communications seeks to deeply integrate artificial intelligence (AI) with user-centric communication networks, with the goal of developing AI-native networks that more accurately address user requirements. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) offers significant potential in realizing these goals. However, existing efforts that leverage LLMs for wireless communication often overlook the considerable gap between human natural language and the intricacies of real-world communication systems, thus failing to fully exploit the capabilities of LLMs. To address this gap, we propose a novel LLM-driven paradigm for wireless communication that innovatively incorporates the nature language to structured query language (NL2SQL) tool. Specifically, in this paradigm, user personal requirements is the primary focus. Upon receiving a user request, LLMs first analyze the user intent in terms of relevant communication metrics and system parameters. Subsequently, a structured query language (SQL) statement is generated to retrieve the specific parameter values from a high-performance real-time database. We further utilize LLMs to formulate and solve an optimization problem based on the user request and the retrieved parameters. The solution to this optimization problem then drives adjustments in the communication system to fulfill the user's requirements. To validate the feasibility of the proposed paradigm, we present a prototype system. In this prototype, we consider user-request centric semantic communication (URC-SC) system in which a dynamic semantic representation network at the physical layer adapts its encoding depth to meet user requirements. Additionally, two LLMs are employed to analyze user requests and generate SQL statements, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Empowering Multimodal Large Language Models for Forensics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11686v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of generative AI facilitates content creation and makes image manipulation easier and more difficult to detect. While multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) have encoded rich world knowledge, they are not inherently tailored for combating AI-generated Content (AIGC) and struggle to comprehend local forgery details. In this work, we investigate the application of multimodal LLMs in forgery detection. We propose a framework capable of evaluating image authenticity, localizing tampered regions, providing evidence, and tracing generation methods based on semantic tampering clues. Our method demonstrates that the potential of LLMs in forgery analysis can be effectively unlocked through meticulous prompt engineering and the application of few-shot learning techniques. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments and show that GPT4V can achieve an accuracy of 92.1% in Autosplice and 86.3% in LaMa, which is competitive with state-of-the-art AIGC detection methods. We further discuss the limitations of multimodal LLMs in such tasks and propose potential improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, 13IHMMSec2025</p></details> |

Despite these advances, recent research indicates that Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-3.5-turbo, underachieve compared to well-trained smaller models, such as BERT, in Fake News Detection (FND), prompting inquiries into LVLMs' efficacy in FND tasks. Although performance could improve through fine-tuning LVLMs, the substantial parameters and requisite pre-trained weights render it a resource-heavy endeavor for FND applications. This paper initially assesses the FND capabilities of two notable LVLMs, CogVLM and GPT4V, in comparison to a smaller yet adeptly trained CLIP model in a zero-shot context. The findings demonstrate that LVLMs can attain performance competitive with that of the smaller model. Next, we integrate standard in-context learning (ICL) with LVLMs, noting improvements in FND performance, though limited in scope and consistency. To address this, we introduce the \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{F}ake \textbf{N}ews \textbf{D}etection (IMFND) framework, enriching in-context examples and test inputs with predictions and corresponding probabilities from a well-trained smaller model. This strategic integration directs the LVLMs' focus towards news segments associated with higher probabilities, thereby improving their analytical accuracy. The experimental results suggest that the IMFND framework significantly boosts the FND efficiency of LVLMs, achieving enhanced accuracy over the standard ICL approach across three publicly available FND datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdraw for new experiments</p></details> |

Users commonly rely on the intuition that well-written text is easier to translate when using off-the-shelf MT systems. LLMs can rewrite text in many ways but in the context of MT, these capabilities have been primarily exploited to rewrite outputs via post-editing. We present an empirical study of 21 input rewriting methods with 3 open-weight LLMs for translating from English into 6 target languages. We show that text simplification is the most effective MT-agnostic rewrite strategy and that it can be improved further when using quality estimation to assess translatability. Human evaluation further confirms that simplified rewrites and their MT outputs both largely preserve the original meaning of the source and MT. These results suggest LLM-assisted input rewriting as a promising direction for improving translations.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Combining Artificial Users and Psychotherapist Assessment to Evaluate Large Language Model-based Mental Health Chatbots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21540v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to overcome limitations of rule-based mental health chatbots through more natural conversations. However, evaluating LLM-based mental health chatbots presents a significant challenge: Their probabilistic nature requires comprehensive testing to ensure therapeutic quality, yet conducting such evaluations with people with depression would impose an additional burden on vulnerable people and risk exposing them to potentially harmful content. Our paper presents an evaluation approach for LLM-based mental health chatbots that combines dialogue generation with artificial users and dialogue evaluation by psychotherapists. We developed artificial users based on patient vignettes, systematically varying characteristics such as depression severity, personality traits, and attitudes toward chatbots, and let them interact with a LLM-based behavioral activation chatbot. Ten psychotherapists evaluated 48 randomly selected dialogues using standardized rating scales to assess the quality of behavioral activation and its therapeutic capabilities. We found that while artificial users showed moderate authenticity, they enabled comprehensive testing across different users. In addition, the chatbot demonstrated promising capabilities in delivering behavioral activation and maintaining safety. Furthermore, we identified deficits, such as ensuring the appropriateness of the activity plan, which reveals necessary improvements for the chatbot. Our framework provides an effective method for evaluating LLM-based mental health chatbots while protecting vulnerable people during the evaluation process. Future research should improve the authenticity of artificial users and develop LLM-augmented evaluation tools to make psychotherapist evaluation more efficient, and thus further advance the evaluation of LLM-based mental health chatbots.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a novel approach by fine-tuning Meta's Llama3 Large Language Models (LLMs) to create SynLlama, which generates full synthetic pathways made of commonly accessible building blocks and robust organic reaction templates. SynLlama explores a large synthesizable space using significantly less data compared to other state-of-the-art methods, and offers strong performance in bottom-up synthesis, synthesizable analog generation, and hit expansion, offering medicinal chemists a valuable tool for drug discovery developments. We find that SynLlama, even without training on external building blocks, can effectively generalize to unseen yet purchasable building blocks, meaning that its reconstruction capabilities extend to a broader synthesizable chemical space than the training data. We also demonstrate the use of SynLlama in a pharmaceutical context for synthesis planning of analog molecules and hit expansion leads for proposed inhibitors of target proteins.</p></details> |  |

While reinforcement learning (RL) applied to LLMs shows promise, progress is significantly hindered by the lack of large-scale training data that is sufficiently challenging, possesses verifiable answer formats suitable for RL, and is free from contamination with evaluation benchmarks. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepMath-103K, a new, large-scale dataset comprising approximately 103K mathematical problems, specifically designed to train advanced reasoning models via RL. DeepMath-103K is curated through a rigorous pipeline involving source analysis, stringent decontamination against numerous benchmarks, and filtering for high difficulty (primarily Levels 5-9), significantly exceeding existing open resources in challenge. Each problem includes a verifiable final answer, enabling rule-based RL, and three distinct R1-generated solutions suitable for diverse training paradigms like supervised fine-tuning or distillation. Spanning a wide range of mathematical topics, DeepMath-103K promotes the development of generalizable reasoning. We demonstrate that models trained on DeepMath-103K achieve significant improvements on challenging mathematical benchmarks, validating its effectiveness. We release DeepMath-103K publicly to facilitate community progress in building more capable AI reasoning systems: https://github.com/zwhe99/DeepMath.</p></details> | WIP |
| **[Optimal Hardness of Online Algorithms for Large Independent Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11450v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the algorithmic problem of finding a large independent set in an Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$. For constant $p$ and $b=1/(1-p)$, the largest independent set has size $2\log_b n$, while a simple greedy algorithm revealing vertices sequentially and making decisions based only on previously seen vertices finds an independent set of size $\log_b n$. In his seminal 1976 paper, Karp challenged to either improve this guarantee or establish its hardness. Decades later, this problem remains open, one of the most prominent algorithmic problems in the theory of random graphs. In this paper, we establish that a broad class of online algorithms fails to find an independent set of size $(1+\epsilon)\log_b n$ any constant $\epsilon>0$ w.h.p. This class includes Karp's algorithm as a special case, and extends it by allowing the algorithm to query exceptional edges not yet 'seen' by the algorithm. Our lower bound holds for all $p\in [d/n,1-n^{-1/d}]$, where $d$ is a large constant. In the dense regime (constant $p$), we further prove that our result is asymptotically tight with respect to the number of exceptional edges queried, by designing an online algorithm which beats the half-optimality threshold when the number of exceptional edges slightly exceeds our bound. Our result provides evidence for the algorithmic hardness of Karp's problem by supporting the conjectured optimality of the aforementioned greedy algorithm and establishing it within the class of online algorithms. Our proof relies on a refined analysis of the geometric structure of tuples of large independent sets, establishing a variant of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP) commonly used as a barrier for classes of algorithms. While OGP has predominantly served as a barrier to stable algorithms, online algorithms are not stable and our application of OGP-based techniques to online setting is novel.</p></details> |  |

Masculine defaults involve three key parts: (i) the cultural context, (ii) the masculine characteristics or behaviors, and (iii) the reward for, or simply acceptance of, those masculine characteristics or behaviors. In this work, we study discourse-based masculine defaults, and propose a twofold framework for (i) the large-scale discovery and analysis of gendered discourse words in spoken content via our Gendered Discourse Correlation Framework (GDCF); and (ii) the measurement of the gender bias associated with these gendered discourse words in LLMs via our Discourse Word-Embedding Association Test (D-WEAT). We focus our study on podcasts, a popular and growing form of social media, analyzing 15,117 podcast episodes. We analyze correlations between gender and discourse words -- discovered via LDA and BERTopic -- to automatically form gendered discourse word lists. We then study the prevalence of these gendered discourse words in domain-specific contexts, and find that gendered discourse-based masculine defaults exist in the domains of business, technology/politics, and video games. Next, we study the representation of these gendered discourse words from a state-of-the-art LLM embedding model from OpenAI, and find that the masculine discourse words have a more stable and robust representation than the feminine discourse words, which may result in better system performance on downstream tasks for men. Hence, men are rewarded for their discourse patterns with better system performance by one of the state-of-the-art language models -- and this embedding disparity is a representational harm and a masculine default.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICWSM 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Dual-Space Framework for General Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11426v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution to compress large language models (LLMs) by transferring their knowledge to smaller models. During this process, white-box KD methods usually minimize the distance between the output distributions of the teacher model and the student model to transfer more information. However, we reveal that the current white-box KD framework exhibits two limitations: a) bridging probability distributions from different output spaces will limit the similarity between the teacher model and the student model; b) this framework cannot be applied to LLMs with different vocabularies. One of the root causes for these limitations is that the distributions from the teacher and the student for KD are output by different prediction heads, which yield distributions in different output spaces and dimensions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dual-space knowledge distillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the prediction heads of the teacher and the student models for KD. Specifically, we first introduce two projectors with ideal initialization to project the teacher/student hidden states into the student/teacher representation spaces. After this, the hidden states from different models can share the same head and unify the output spaces of the distributions. Furthermore, we develop an exact token alignment (ETA) algorithm to align the same tokens in two differently-tokenized sequences. Based on the above, our DSKD framework is a general KD framework that supports both off-policy and on-policy KD, and KD between any two LLMs regardless of their vocabularies. Extensive experiments on instruction-following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation benchmarks show that DSKD significantly outperforms existing methods based on the current white-box KD framework and surpasses other cross-tokenizer KD methods for LLMs with different vocabularies.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures, 11 tables, under review.

| **[Graph Linearization Methods for Reasoning on Graphs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19494v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have evolved to process multiple modalities beyond text, such as images and audio, which motivates us to explore how to effectively leverage them for graph reasoning tasks. The key question, therefore, is how to transform graphs into linear sequences of tokens, a process we term "graph linearization", so that LLMs can handle graphs naturally. We consider that graphs should be linearized meaningfully to reflect certain properties of natural language text, such as local dependency and global alignment, in order to ease contemporary LLMs, trained on trillions of textual tokens, better understand graphs. To achieve this, we developed several graph linearization methods based on graph centrality and degeneracy. These methods are further enhanced using node relabeling techniques. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods compared to the random linearization baseline. Our work introduces novel graph representations suitable for LLMs, contributing to the potential integration of graph machine learning with the trend of multimodal processing using a unified transformer model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical few-shot learning for large-scale classification via parameter pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11404v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large-scale few-shot learning for classification problems, often there are a large number of classes and few high-dimensional observations per class. Previous model-based methods, such as Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA), require the strong assumptions of a shared covariance matrix between all classes. Quadratic discriminant analysis will often lead to singular or unstable covariance matrix estimates. Both of these methods can lead to lower-than-desired classification performance. We introduce a novel, model-based clustering method that can relax the shared covariance assumptions of LDA by clustering sample covariance matrices, either singular or non-singular. In addition, we study the statistical properties of parameter estimates. This will lead to covariance matrix estimates which are pooled within each cluster of classes. We show, using simulated and real data, that our classification method tends to yield better discrimination compared to other methods.</p></details> |  |

DMPC has the prospect of scaling well by parallelizing computations among subsystems. However, communication delays may deteriorate the performance of decentralized optimization, if excessively many iterations are required per control step. Moreover, centralized solvers often exhibit faster asymptotic convergence rates and, by parallelizing costly linear algebra operations, they can also benefit from modern multicore computing architectures. On this canvas, we study the computational performance of cooperative DMPC for linear and nonlinear systems. To this end, we apply a tailored decentralized real-time iteration scheme to frequency control for power systems. DMPC scales well for the considered linear and nonlinear benchmarks, as the iteration number does not depend on the number of subsystems. Comparisons with multi-threaded centralized solvers demonstrate competitive performance of the proposed decentralized optimization algorithms.</p></details> |  |

One key limitation is their inconsistency at reporting the the same information when prompts are changed. In this paper, we consider the discrepancy between a model's generated answer and their own verification of that answer, the generator-validator gap. We define this gap in a more stringent way than prior work: we expect correlation of scores from a generator and a validator over the entire set of candidate answers. We show that according to this measure, a large gap exists in various settings, including question answering, lexical semantics tasks, and next-word prediction. We then propose RankAlign, a ranking-based training method, and show that it significantly closes the gap by 31.8% on average, surpassing all baseline methods. Moreover, this approach generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks and lexical items.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching Large Language Models to Reason through Learning and Forgetting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11364v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging inference-time search in large language models has proven effective in further enhancing a trained model's capability to solve complex mathematical and reasoning problems. However, this approach significantly increases computational costs and inference time, as the model must generate and evaluate multiple candidate solutions to identify a viable reasoning path. To address this, we propose an effective approach that integrates search capabilities directly into the model by fine-tuning it using both successful (learning) and failed reasoning paths (forgetting) derived from diverse search methods. While fine-tuning the model with these data might seem straightforward, we identify a critical issue: the model's search capability tends to degrade rapidly if fine-tuning is performed naively. We show that this degradation can be substantially mitigated by employing a smaller learning rate. Extensive experiments on the challenging Game-of-24 and Countdown mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that our approach not only outperforms both standard fine-tuning and inference-time search baselines but also significantly reduces inference time by 180$\times$.</p></details> |  |

Despite decades of research, misleading visualizations remain a widespread and pressing issue. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong chart comprehension capabilities, yet no existing work has systematically evaluated their ability to detect and interpret misleading charts. This paper introduces the Misleading Chart Question Answering (Misleading ChartQA) Benchmark, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed to assess MLLMs in identifying and reasoning about misleading charts. It contains over 3,000 curated examples, covering 21 types of misleaders and 10 chart types. Each example includes standardized chart code, CSV data, and multiple-choice questions with labeled explanations, validated through multi-round MLLM checks and exhausted expert human review. We benchmark 16 state-of-the-art MLLMs on our dataset, revealing their limitations in identifying visually deceptive practices. We also propose a novel pipeline that detects and localizes misleaders, enhancing MLLMs' accuracy in misleading chart interpretation. Our work establishes a foundation for advancing MLLM-driven misleading chart comprehension. We publicly release the sample dataset to support further research in this critical area.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages in total. Under Review</p></details> |

Traditionally, many phishing emails have been characterized by typos, errors, and poor language. These errors can be mitigated by LLMs, potentially lowering the barrier for attackers. Despite this, there is a lack of large-scale studies comparing the effectiveness of LLM-generated lateral phishing emails to those crafted by humans. Current literature does not adequately address the comparative effectiveness of LLM and human-generated lateral phishing emails in a real-world, large-scale organizational setting, especially considering the potential for LLMs to generate more convincing and error-free phishing content. To address this gap, we conducted a pioneering study within a large university, targeting its workforce of approximately 9,000 individuals including faculty, staff, administrators, and student workers. Our results indicate that LLM-generated lateral phishing emails are as effective as those written by communications professionals, emphasizing the critical threat posed by LLMs in leading phishing campaigns. We break down the results of the overall phishing experiment, comparing vulnerability between departments and job roles. Furthermore, to gather qualitative data, we administered a detailed questionnaire, revealing insights into the reasons and motivations behind vulnerable employee's actions. This study contributes to the understanding of cyber security threats in educational institutions and provides a comprehensive comparison of LLM and human-generated phishing emails' effectiveness, considering the potential for LLMs to generate more convincing content. The findings highlight the need for enhanced user education and system defenses to mitigate the growing threat of AI-powered phishing attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

However, producing insightful and engaging commentary for complex games with incomplete information remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel commentary method that combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) and LLMs, tailored specifically for the Chinese card game \textit{Guandan}. Our system leverages RL to generate intricate card-playing scenarios and employs LLMs to generate corresponding commentary text, effectively emulating the strategic analysis and narrative prowess of professional commentators. The framework comprises a state commentary guide, a Theory of Mind (ToM)-based strategy analyzer, and a style retrieval module, which seamlessly collaborate to deliver detailed and context-relevant game commentary in the Chinese language environment. We empower LLMs with ToM capabilities and refine both retrieval and information filtering mechanisms. This facilitates the generation of personalized commentary content. Our experimental results showcase the substantial enhancement in performance achieved by the proposed commentary framework when applied to open-source LLMs, surpassing the performance of GPT-4 across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

LLMs have a wide range of application value in the field of humanities and social sciences because of its strong text understanding, generation and reasoning capabilities. In humanities and social sciences research, LLMs can analyze large-scale text data and make inferences. This article analyzes the large language model DeepSeek-R1 from seven aspects: low-resource language translation, educational question-answering, student writing improvement in higher education, logical reasoning, educational measurement and psychometrics, public health policy analysis, and art education . Then we compare the answers given by DeepSeek-R1 in the seven aspects with the answers given by o1-preview. DeepSeek-R1 performs well in the humanities and social sciences, answering most questions correctly and logically, and can give reasonable analysis processes and explanations. Compared with o1-preview, it can automatically generate reasoning processes and provide more detailed explanations, which is suitable for beginners or people who need to have a detailed understanding of this knowledge, while o1-preview is more suitable for quick reading.

To address this challenge, we propose an agent system that integrates large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs. By leveraging LLMs' powerful capabilities for extracting and recognizing chemical substance names, and storing the extracted data in a structured knowledge graph, our system fully automates the retrieval of relevant literatures, extraction of reaction data, database querying, construction of retrosynthetic pathway trees, further expansion through the retrieval of additional literature and recommendation of optimal reaction pathways. By considering the complex interdependencies among chemical reactants, a novel Multi-branched Reaction Pathway Search Algorithm (MBRPS) is proposed to help identify all valid multi-branched reaction pathways, which arise when a single product decomposes into multiple reaction intermediates. In contrast, previous studies were limited to cases where a product decomposes into at most one reaction intermediate. This work represents the first attempt to develop a fully automated retrosynthesis planning agent tailored specially for macromolecules powered by LLMs. Applied to polyimide synthesis, our new approach constructs a retrosynthetic pathway tree with hundreds of pathways and recommends optimized routes, including both known and novel pathways. This demonstrates utilizing LLMs for literature consultation to accomplish specific tasks is possible and crucial for future materials research, given the vast amount of materials-related literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code of RetroSynthesisAgent is available at https://github.com/QinyuMa316/RetroSynthesisAgent</p></details> |

Existing video summarization methods, which heavily rely on visual features and temporal dynamics, often fail to capture the semantics of video content, resulting in incomplete or incoherent summaries. To tackle the challenge, we propose a new video summarization framework that leverages the capabilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs), expecting that the knowledge learned from massive data enables LLMs to evaluate video frames in a manner that better aligns with diverse semantics and human judgments, effectively addressing the inherent subjectivity in defining keyframes. Our method, dubbed LLM-based Video Summarization (LLMVS), translates video frames into a sequence of captions using a Muti-modal Large Language Model (M-LLM) and then assesses the importance of each frame using an LLM, based on the captions in its local context. These local importance scores are refined through a global attention mechanism in the entire context of video captions, ensuring that our summaries effectively reflect both the details and the overarching narrative. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing ones in standard benchmarks, highlighting the potential of LLMs in the processing of multimedia content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Autonomous Driving Systems with On-Board Deployed Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11514v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Networks (NNs) trained through supervised learning struggle with managing edge-case scenarios common in real-world driving due to the intractability of exhaustive datasets covering all edge-cases, making knowledge-driven approaches, akin to how humans intuitively detect unexpected driving behavior, a suitable complement to data-driven methods. This work proposes a hybrid architecture combining low-level Model Predictive Controller (MPC) with locally deployed Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance decision-making and Human Machine Interaction (HMI). The DecisionxLLM module evaluates robotic state information against natural language instructions to ensure adherence to desired driving behavior. The MPCxLLM module then adjusts MPC parameters based on LLM-generated insights, achieving control adaptability while preserving the safety and constraint guarantees of traditional MPC systems. Further, to enable efficient on-board deployment and to eliminate dependency on cloud connectivity, we shift processing to the on-board computing platform: We propose an approach that exploits Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, and quantization. Experimental results demonstrate that these enhancements yield significant improvements in reasoning accuracy by up to 10.45%, control adaptability by as much as 52.2%, and up to 10.5x increase in computational efficiency (tokens/s), validating the proposed framework's practicality for real-time deployment even on down-scaled robotic platforms. This work bridges high-level decision-making with low-level control adaptability, offering a synergistic framework for knowledge-driven and adaptive Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS).</p></details> |  |

However, their performance in specialized domains like ophthalmology remains underexplored. This study comprehensively evaluated and compared the accuracy and reasoning capabilities of four newly developed reasoning-focused LLMs, namely DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1, o3-mini, and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking. Each model was assessed using 5,888 multiple-choice ophthalmology exam questions from the MedMCQA dataset in zero-shot setting. Quantitative evaluation included accuracy, Macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, METEOR, BERTScore, BARTScore, and AlignScore), computed against ground-truth reasonings. Average inference time was recorded for a subset of 100 randomly selected questions. Additionally, two board-certified ophthalmologists qualitatively assessed clarity, completeness, and reasoning structure of responses to differential diagnosis questions.O1 (0.902) and DeepSeek-R1 (0.888) achieved the highest accuracy, with o1 also leading in Macro-F1 (0.900). The performance of models across the text-generation metrics varied: O3-mini excelled in ROUGE-L (0.151), o1 in METEOR (0.232), DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini tied for BERTScore (0.673), DeepSeek-R1 (-4.105) and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking (-4.127) performed best in BARTScore, while o3-mini (0.181) and o1 (0.176) led AlignScore. Inference time across the models varied, with DeepSeek-R1 being slowest (40.4 seconds) and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking fastest (6.7 seconds). Qualitative evaluation revealed that DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking tended to provide detailed and comprehensive intermediate reasoning, whereas o1 and o3-mini displayed concise and summarized justifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>83 pa...</summary><p>83 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, 9 supplementary figures, 7 supplementary tables</p></details> |

Unlike other multimodal models, TerraMind is pretrained on dual-scale representations combining both token-level and pixel-level data across modalities. On a token level, TerraMind encodes high-level contextual information to learn cross-modal relationships, while on a pixel level, TerraMind leverages fine-grained representations to capture critical spatial nuances. We pretrained TerraMind on nine geospatial modalities of a global, large-scale dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that (i) TerraMind's dual-scale early fusion approach unlocks a range of zero-shot and few-shot applications for Earth observation, (ii) TerraMind introduces "Thinking-in-Modalities" (TiM) -- the capability of generating additional artificial data during finetuning and inference to improve the model output -- and (iii) TerraMind achieves beyond state-of-the-art performance in community-standard benchmarks for EO like PANGAEA. The pretraining dataset, the model weights, and our code is open-sourced under a permissive license.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low-Rank SPIKE Framework for Solving Large Sparse Linear Systems with Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11167v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The SPIKE family of linear system solvers provides parallelism using a block tridiagonal partitioning. Typically SPIKE-based solvers are applied to banded systems, resulting in structured off-diagonal blocks with non-zeros elements restricted to relatively small submatrices comprising the band of the original matrix. In this work, a low-rank SVD based approximation of the off-diagonal blocks is investigated. This produces a representation which more effectively handles matrices with large, sparse bands. A set of flexible distributed solvers, the LR-SPIKE variants, are implemented. There are applicable to a wide range of applications -- from use as a "black-box" preconditioner which straightforwardly improves upon the classic Block Jacobi preconditioner, to use as a specialized "approximate direct solver." An investigation of the effectiveness of the new preconditioners for a selection of SuiteSparse matrices is performed, particularly focusing on matrices derived from 3D finite element simulations. In addition, the SPIKE approximate linear system solvers are also paired with the FEAST eigenvalue solver, where they are shown to be particularly effective due to the former's rapid convergence, and the latter's acceptance of loose linear system solver convergence, resulting in a combination which requires very few solver iterations.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Yet few works have explored the potential of LLM in quantum computing. The most challenging problem is how to leverage LLMs to automatically generate quantum circuits at a large scale. In this paper, we address such a challenge by fine-tuning LLMs and injecting the domain-specific knowledge of quantum computing. In particular, we investigate the mechanisms to generate training data sets and construct the end-to-end pipeline to fine-tune pre-trained LLMs that produce parameterized quantum circuits for optimization problems. We have prepared 14,000 quantum circuits covering a substantial part of the quantum optimization landscape: 12 optimization problem instances and their optimized QAOA, VQE, and adaptive VQE circuits. The fine-tuned LLMs can construct syntactically correct parametrized quantum circuits in the most recent OpenQASM 3.0. We have evaluated the quality of the parameters by comparing them to the optimized expectation values and distributions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM outperforms state-of-the-art models and that the parameters are better than random. The LLM-generated parametrized circuits and initial parameters can be used as a starting point for further optimization, \emph{e.g.,} templates in quantum machine learning and the benchmark for compilers and hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, these capabilities come with an increased model scale. While post-training pruning reduces model size in unimodal models, its application to MLLMs often yields limited success. Our analysis discovers that conventional methods fail to account for the unique token attributes across layers and modalities inherent to MLLMs. Inspired by this observation, we propose TAMP, a simple yet effective pruning framework tailored for MLLMs, featuring two key components: (1) Diversity-Aware Sparsity, which adjusts sparsity ratio per layer based on diversities among multimodal output tokens, preserving more parameters in high-diversity layers; and (2) Adaptive Multimodal Input Activation, which identifies representative multimodal input tokens using attention scores to guide unstructured weight pruning. We validate our method on two state-of-the-art MLLMs: LLaVA-NeXT, designed for vision-language tasks, and VideoLLaMA2, capable of processing audio, visual, and language modalities. Empirical experiments across various multimodal evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that each component of our approach substantially outperforms existing pruning techniques.</p></details> | Preprint |

Yet, despite the strong performance of Large Vision and Language Models across a wide range of tasks, they struggle with interpreting checkable content. This challenge becomes particularly pressing in industries where a single overlooked checkbox may lead to costly regulatory or contractual oversights. To address this gap, we introduce the CheckboxQA dataset, a targeted resource designed to evaluate and improve model performance on checkbox-related tasks. It reveals the limitations of current models and serves as a valuable tool for advancing document comprehension systems, with significant implications for applications in sectors such as legal tech and finance.

| **[QAVA: Query-Agnostic Visual Attack to Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11038v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In typical multimodal tasks, such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), adversarial attacks targeting a specific image and question can lead large vision-language models (LVLMs) to provide incorrect answers. However, it is common for a single image to be associated with multiple questions, and LVLMs may still answer other questions correctly even for an adversarial image attacked by a specific question. To address this, we introduce the query-agnostic visual attack (QAVA), which aims to create robust adversarial examples that generate incorrect responses to unspecified and unknown questions. Compared to traditional adversarial attacks focused on specific images and questions, QAVA significantly enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of attacks on images when the question is unknown, achieving performance comparable to attacks on known target questions. Our research broadens the scope of visual adversarial attacks on LVLMs in practical settings, uncovering previously overlooked vulnerabilities, particularly in the context of visual adversarial threats.

| **[New Constructions of Binary Cyclic Codes with Both Relatively Large Minimum Distance and Dual Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11010v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary cyclic codes are worth studying due to their applications and theoretical importance. It is an important problem to construct an infinite family of cyclic codes with large minimum distance $d$ and dual distance $d^{\perp}$. In recent years, much research has been devoted to improving the lower bound on $d$, some of which have exceeded the square-root bound. The constructions presented recently seem to indicate that when the minimum distance increases, the minimum distance of its dual code decreases. In this paper, we focus on the new constructions of binary cyclic codes with length $n=2^m-1$, dimension near $n/2$, and both relatively large minimum distance and dual distance. For $m$ is even, we construct a family of binary cyclic codes with parameters $[2^m-1,2^{m-1}\pm1,d]$, where $d\ge 2^{m/2}-1$ and $d^\perp\ge2^{m/2}$. Both the minimum distance and the dual distance are significantly better than the previous results. When $m$ is the product of two distinct primes, we construct some cyclic codes with dimensions $k=(n+1)/2$ and $d>\frac{n}{\log_2n},$ where the lower bound on the minimum distance is much larger than the square-root bound. For $m$ is odd, we present two families of binary $[2^m-1,2^{m-1},d]$ cyclic codes with $d\ge2^{(m+1)/2}-1$, $d^\perp\ge2^{(m+1)/2}$ and $d\ge2^{(m+3)/2}-15$, $d^\perp\ge2^{(m-1)/2}$ respectively, which leads that $d\cdot d^\perp$ can reach $2n$ asymptotically. To the best of our knowledge, except for the punctured binary Reed-Muller codes, there is no other construction of binary cyclic codes that reaches this bound.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for Large Language Models Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03784v3)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique for aligning the output of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. To learn the reward function, most existing RLHF algorithms use the Bradley-Terry model, which relies on assumptions about human preferences that may not reflect the complexity and variability of real-world judgments. In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm to enhance the performance of existing approaches under such reward model misspecifications. Theoretically, our algorithm reduces the variance of reward and policy estimators, leading to improved regret bounds. Empirical evaluations on LLM benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing methods, with 77-81% of responses being favored over baselines on the Anthropic Helpful and Harmless dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Compressing Prompts for Efficient Inference of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11004v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance across a variety of tasks, partly due to advanced prompting techniques. However, these techniques often require lengthy prompts, which increase computational costs and can hinder performance because of the limited context windows of LLMs. While prompt compression is a straightforward solution, existing methods confront the challenges of retaining essential information, adapting to context changes, and remaining effective across different tasks. To tackle these issues, we propose a task-agnostic method called Dynamic Compressing Prompts (LLM-DCP). Our method reduces the number of prompt tokens while aiming to preserve the performance as much as possible. We model prompt compression as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling the DCP-Agent to sequentially remove redundant tokens by adapting to dynamic contexts and retaining crucial content. We develop a reward function for training the DCP-Agent that balances the compression rate, the quality of the LLM output, and the retention of key information. This allows for prompt token reduction without needing an external black-box LLM. Inspired by the progressive difficulty adjustment in curriculum learning, we introduce a Hierarchical Prompt Compression (HPC) training strategy that gradually increases the compression difficulty, enabling the DCP-Agent to learn an effective compression method that maintains information integrity. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, especially at higher compression rates. The code for our approach will be available at https://github.com/Fhujinwu/DCP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review (submited in 2024.11)</p></details> |

These benchmarks provide the researchers with a corpus of documents, topics and relevance judgements indicating which documents are relevant for each topic. While test collections are an integral part of Information Retrieval (IR) research, their creation involves significant efforts in manual annotation. Large language models (LLMs) are gaining much attention as tools for automatic relevance assessment. Recent research has shown that LLM-based assessments yield high systems ranking correlation with human-made judgements. These correlations are helpful in large-scale experiments but less informative if we want to focus on top-performing systems. Moreover, these correlations ignore whether and how LLM-based judgements impact the statistically significant differences among systems with respect to human assessments. In this work, we look at how LLM-generated judgements preserve ranking differences among top-performing systems and also how they preserve pairwise significance evaluation as human judgements. Our results show that LLM-based judgements are unfair at ranking top-performing systems. Moreover, we observe an exceedingly high rate of false positives regarding statistical differences. Our work represents a step forward in the evaluation of the reliability of using LLMs-based judgements for IR evaluation. We hope this will serve as a basis for other researchers to develop more reliable models for automatic relevance assessment.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models Over-Rely on Names to Identify Ingredients of Chinese Drugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03786v3)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has seen increasing adoption in healthcare, with specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging to support clinical applications. A fundamental requirement for these models is accurate identification of TCM drug ingredients. In this paper, we evaluate how general and TCM-specialized LLMs perform when identifying ingredients of Chinese drugs. Our systematic analysis reveals consistent failure patterns: models often interpret drug names literally, overuse common herbs regardless of relevance, and exhibit erratic behaviors when faced with unfamiliar formulations. LLMs also fail to understand the verification task. These findings demonstrate that current LLMs rely primarily on drug names rather than possessing systematic pharmacological knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach focused on ingredient names. Experiments across 220 TCM formulations show our method significantly improves accuracy from approximately 50% to 82% in ingredient verification tasks. Our work highlights critical weaknesses in current TCM-specific LLMs and offers a practical solution for enhancing their clinical reliability.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, their generalization across different tasks and unseen data is very limited. Large language models (LLMs), known for their strong generalization capabilities, have shown promising performance in various domains. However, their application to the traffic analysis domain is limited due to significantly different characteristics of network traffic. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose TrafficLLM, which introduces a dual-stage fine-tuning framework to learn generic traffic representation from heterogeneous raw traffic data. The framework uses traffic-domain tokenization, dual-stage tuning pipeline, and extensible adaptation to help LLM release generalization ability on dynamic traffic analysis tasks, such that it enables traffic detection and traffic generation across a wide range of downstream tasks. We evaluate TrafficLLM across 10 distinct scenarios and 229 types of traffic. TrafficLLM achieves F1-scores of 0.9875 and 0.9483, with up to 80.12% and 33.92% better performance than existing detection and generation methods. It also shows strong generalization on unseen traffic with an 18.6% performance improvement. We further evaluate TrafficLLM in real-world scenarios. The results confirm that TrafficLLM is easy to scale and achieves accurate detection performance on enterprise traffic.</p></details> |  |

The divide-and-conquer paradigm has enabled large-scale scene reconstruction, but significant challenges remain in scene partitioning, optimization, and merging processes. This paper introduces BlockGaussian, a novel framework incorporating a content-aware scene partition strategy and visibility-aware block optimization to achieve efficient and high-quality large-scale scene reconstruction. Specifically, our approach considers the content-complexity variation across different regions and balances computational load during scene partitioning, enabling efficient scene reconstruction. To tackle the supervision mismatch issue during independent block optimization, we introduce auxiliary points during individual block optimization to align the ground-truth supervision, which enhances the reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-view geometry constraint that effectively mitigates rendering degradation caused by airspace floaters during block merging. Extensive experiments on large-scale scenes demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction efficiency and rendering quality, with a 5x speedup in optimization and an average PSNR improvement of 1.21 dB on multiple benchmarks. Notably, BlockGaussian significantly reduces computational requirements, enabling large-scale scene reconstruction on a single 24GB VRAM device.

However, existing benchmarks are typically static and often overlap with pre-training datasets, leading to fixed complexity constraints and substantial data contamination issues. Meanwhile, manually annotated datasets are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and subject to human bias and inconsistency, leading to reliability and reproducibility issues. To address these problems, we propose a fully dynamic multimodal evaluation framework, named Open-ended Visual Puzzle Generation (OVPG), which aims to generate fresh, diverse, and verifiable evaluation data automatically in puzzle-solving tasks. Specifically, the OVPG pipeline consists of a raw material sampling module, a visual content generation module, and a puzzle rule design module, which ensures that each evaluation instance is primitive, highly randomized, and uniquely solvable, enabling continual adaptation to the evolving capabilities of LMMs. Built upon OVPG, we construct PuzzleBench, a dynamic and scalable benchmark comprising 11,840 VQA samples. It features six carefully designed puzzle tasks targeting three core LMM competencies, visual recognition, logical reasoning, and context understanding. PuzzleBench differs from static benchmarks that quickly become outdated. It enables ongoing dataset refreshing through OVPG and a rich set of open-ended puzzle designs, allowing seamless adaptation to the evolving capabilities of LMMs.</p></details> |  |

However, these tasks are challenging due to the diversity and richness of visual features. We introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-informed feature discovery framework that leverages multimodal LLMs, such as GPT-4o, to evaluate content credibility and explain its reasoning. We extract and quantify interpretable features using targeted prompts and integrate them into machine learning models to improve credibility predictions. We tested this approach on 4,191 visual social media posts across eight topics in science, health, and politics, using credibility ratings from 5,355 crowdsourced workers. Our method outperformed zero-shot GPT-based predictions by 13 percent in R2, and revealed key features like information concreteness and image format. We discuss the implications for misinformation mitigation, visual credibility, and the role of LLMs in social science.</p></details> | 26 pages |

However, the substantial computational overhead associated with LVLMs presents a new challenge. The primary source of this computational cost arises from processing hundreds of image tokens. Therefore, an effective strategy to mitigate such overhead is to reduce the number of image tokens, a process known as image token pruning. Previous studies on image token pruning for LVLMs have primarily focused on high level visual understanding tasks, such as visual question answering and image captioning. In contrast, guiding vision foundation models to generate accurate visual masks based on textual queries demands precise semantic and spatial reasoning capabilities. Consequently, pruning methods must carefully control individual image tokens throughout the LVLM reasoning process. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing methods struggle to adequately balance reductions in computational overhead with the necessity to maintain high segmentation accuracy. In this work, we propose LVLM_CSP, a novel training free visual token pruning method specifically designed for LVLM based reasoning segmentation tasks. LVLM_CSP consists of three stages: clustering, scattering, and pruning. Initially, the LVLM performs coarse-grained visual reasoning using a subset of selected image tokens. Next, fine grained reasoning is conducted, and finally, most visual tokens are pruned in the last stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LVLM_CSP achieves a 65% reduction in image token inference FLOPs with virtually no accuracy degradation, and a 70% reduction with only a minor 1% drop in accuracy on the 7B LVLM.</p></details> |  |

However, the need for linguistic data is not applicable to all practical tasks. In this study, we aim to explore using large vision models (LVMs) or visual foundation models (VFMs) to enhance long-tailed data features without any language information. Specifically, we extract features from the LVM and fuse them with features in the baseline network's map and latent space to obtain the augmented features. Moreover, we design several prototype-based losses in the latent space to further exploit the potential of the augmented features. In the experimental section, we validate our approach on two benchmark datasets: ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist2018.</p></details> |  |

Evidence from China's Social Security Studies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09137v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) is reshaping operational paradigms across multidisciplinary domains. LLMs' emergent capability to synthesize policy-relevant insights across disciplinary boundaries suggests potential as decision-support tools. However, their actual performance and suitability as policy refinement partners still require verification through rigorous and systematic evaluations. Our study employs the context-embedded generation-adaptation framework to conduct a tripartite comparison among the American GPT-4o, the Chinese DeepSeek-R1 and human researchers, investigating the capability boundaries and performance characteristics of LLMs in generating policy recommendations for China's social security issues. This study demonstrates that while LLMs exhibit distinct advantages in systematic policy design, they face significant limitations in addressing complex social dynamics, balancing stakeholder interests, and controlling fiscal risks within the social security domain. Furthermore, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates superior performance to GPT-4o across all evaluation dimensions in policy recommendation generation, illustrating the potential of localized training to improve contextual alignment. These findings suggest that regionally-adapted LLMs can function as supplementary tools for generating diverse policy alternatives informed by domain-specific social insights. Nevertheless, the formulation of policy refinement requires integration with human researchers' expertise, which remains critical for interpreting institutional frameworks, cultural norms, and value systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[LanguageMPC: Large Language Models as Decision Makers for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03026v3)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing learning-based autonomous driving (AD) systems face challenges in comprehending high-level information, generalizing to rare events, and providing interpretability. To address these problems, this work employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as a decision-making component for complex AD scenarios that require human commonsense understanding. We devise cognitive pathways to enable comprehensive reasoning with LLMs, and develop algorithms for translating LLM decisions into actionable driving commands. Through this approach, LLM decisions are seamlessly integrated with low-level controllers by guided parameter matrix adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method not only consistently surpasses baseline approaches in single-vehicle tasks, but also helps handle complex driving behaviors even multi-vehicle coordination, thanks to the commonsense reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This paper presents an initial step toward leveraging LLMs as effective decision-makers for intricate AD scenarios in terms of safety, efficiency, generalizability, and interoperability. We aspire for it to serve as inspiration for future research in this field. Project page: https://sites.google.com/view/llm-mpc</p></details> |  |
| **[IAA: Inner-Adaptor Architecture Empowers Frozen Large Language Model with Multimodal Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12902v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), common methods typically involve unfreezing the language model during training to foster profound visual understanding. However, the fine-tuning of such models with vision-language data often leads to a diminution of their natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. To avoid this performance degradation, a straightforward solution is to freeze the language model while developing multimodal competencies. Unfortunately, previous works have not attained satisfactory outcomes. Building on the strategy of freezing the language model, we conduct thorough structural exploration and introduce the Inner-Adaptor Architecture (IAA). Specifically, the architecture incorporates multiple multimodal adaptors at varying depths within the large language model to facilitate direct interaction with the inherently text-oriented transformer layers, thereby enabling the frozen language model to acquire multimodal capabilities. Unlike previous approaches of freezing language models that require large-scale aligned data, our proposed architecture is able to achieve superior performance on small-scale datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to improve the general multimodal capabilities and visual grounding abilities of the MLLM. Our approach remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across various vision-language benchmarks without sacrificing performance on NLP tasks.

While recent methods based on generative models have shown promising results, they typically require substantial amounts of training data or extensive fine-tuning, limiting their versatility and practical applicability. Alternatively, some training-free approaches leveraging in-context learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged, but they often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities and overly simplistic ranking mechanisms, which restrict their ability to generate consistently high-quality layouts. To this end, we propose LayoutCoT, a novel approach that leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through a combination of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. Specifically, LayoutCoT transforms layout representations into a standardized serialized format suitable for processing by LLMs. A Layout-aware RAG is used to facilitate effective retrieval and generate a coarse layout by LLMs. This preliminary layout, together with the selected exemplars, is then fed into a specially designed CoT reasoning module for iterative refinement, significantly enhancing both semantic coherence and visual quality. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets spanning three conditional layout generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LayoutCoT achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring training or fine-tuning. Notably, our CoT reasoning module enables standard LLMs, even those without explicit deep reasoning abilities, to outperform specialized deep-reasoning models such as deepseek-R1, highlighting the potential of our approach in unleashing the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs for layout generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we reframe contamination as an inherent aspect of learning and seek to disentangle genuine capability acquisition from superficial memorization in LLM evaluation. First, by analyzing model performance under different memorization conditions, we uncover a counterintuitive trend: LLMs perform worse on memorized MCQs than on non-memorized ones, indicating the coexistence of two distinct learning phenomena, i.e., rote memorization and genuine capability learning. To disentangle them, we propose TrinEval, a novel evaluation framework that reformulates MCQs into an alternative trinity format, reducing memorization while preserving knowledge assessment. Experiments validate TrinEval's effectiveness in reformulation, and its evaluation reveals that common LLMs may memorize by rote 20.5% of knowledge points (in MMLU on average).</p></details> | Work in Progress |

However, the diversity and complexity of different components pose a significant challenge to cloud security, especially when dealing with sophisticated and advanced cyberattacks. Recent advancements in generative foundation models (GFMs), particularly in the large language models (LLMs), offer promising solutions for security intelligence. By exploiting the powerful abilities in language understanding, data analysis, task inference, action planning, and code generation, we present LLM-PD, a novel proactive defense architecture that defeats various threats in a proactive manner. LLM-PD can efficiently make a decision through comprehensive data analysis and sequential reasoning, as well as dynamically creating and deploying actionable defense mechanisms on the target cloud. Furthermore, it can flexibly self-evolve based on experience learned from previous interactions and adapt to new attack scenarios without additional training. The experimental results demonstrate its remarkable ability in terms of defense effectiveness and efficiency, particularly highlighting an outstanding success rate when compared with other existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages; In submission</p></details> |

However, designing effective curricula for a specific task often requires extensive domain knowledge and human intervention, which limits its applicability across various domains. Our core idea is that large language models (LLMs), with their extensive training on diverse language data and ability to encapsulate world knowledge, present significant potential for efficiently breaking down tasks and decomposing skills across various robotics environments. Additionally, the demonstrated success of LLMs in translating natural language into executable code for RL agents strengthens their role in generating task curricula. In this work, we propose CurricuLLM, which leverages the high-level planning and programming capabilities of LLMs for curriculum design, thereby enhancing the efficient learning of complex target tasks. CurricuLLM consists of: (Step 1) Generating sequence of subtasks that aid target task learning in natural language form, (Step 2) Translating natural language description of subtasks in executable task code, including the reward code and goal distribution code, and (Step 3) Evaluating trained policies based on trajectory rollout and subtask description. We evaluate CurricuLLM in various robotics simulation environments, ranging from manipulation, navigation, and locomotion, to show that CurricuLLM can aid learning complex robot control tasks. In addition, we validate humanoid locomotion policy learned through CurricuLLM in real-world.

As these AI tools continue to gain importance in applications ranging from virtual assistants to content generation, the volume of traffic they generate is expected to increase massively. These models use the Internet as the global infrastructure for delivering multimedia messages (text, voice, images, video, etc.) to users, by interconnecting users and devices with AI agents typically deployed in the cloud. We believe this represents a new paradigm that will lead to a considerable increase in network traffic, and network operators must be prepared to address the resulting demands. To support this claim, we provide a proof-of-concept and source code for measuring traffic in remote user-agent interactions, estimating the traffic generated per prompt for some of the most popular open-source LLMs in 2025. The average size of each prompt query and response is 7,593 bytes, with a standard deviation of 369 bytes. These numbers are comparable with email and web browsing traffic. However, we envision AI as the next ``killer application" that will saturate networks with traffic, such as Peer-to-Peer traffic and Video-on-demand dominated in previous decades.</p></details> |  |

However, such data -- sometimes referred to as citizen science data -- are opportunistic and lack a structured sampling strategy. This volunteer-collected biodiversity data contains geographic, temporal, taxonomic, observers, and sociopolitical biases that can have significant effects on biodiversity model performance, but whose impacts are unclear for fine-grained species recognition performance. Here we introduce Diversity Shift (DivShift), a framework for quantifying the effects of domain-specific distribution shifts on machine learning model performance. To diagnose the performance effects of biases specific to volunteer-collected biodiversity data, we also introduce DivShift - North American West Coast (DivShift-NAWC), a curated dataset of almost 7.5 million iNaturalist images across the western coast of North America partitioned across five types of expert-verified bias. We compare species recognition performance across these bias partitions using a diverse variety of species- and ecosystem-focused accuracy metrics. We observe that these biases confound model performance less than expected from the underlying label distribution shift, and that more data leads to better model performance but the magnitude of these improvements are bias-specific. These findings imply that while the structure within natural world images provides generalization improvements for biodiversity monitoring tasks, the biases present in volunteer-collected biodiversity data can also affect model performance; thus these models should be used with caution in downstream biodiversity monitoring tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at AAAI-25 AI for Social Impact Track (https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/35060) Presented at NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning (https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2024/43)</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Chains of Thought: Benchmarking Latent-Space Reasoning Abilities in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10615v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can perform reasoning computations both internally within their latent space and externally by generating explicit token sequences like chains of thought. Significant progress in enhancing reasoning abilities has been made by scaling test-time compute. However, understanding and quantifying model-internal reasoning abilities - the inferential "leaps" models make between individual token predictions - remains crucial. This study introduces a benchmark (n = 4,000 items) designed to quantify model-internal reasoning in different domains. We achieve this by having LLMs indicate the correct solution to reasoning problems not through descriptive text, but by selecting a specific language of their initial response token that is different from English, the benchmark language. This not only requires models to reason beyond their context window, but also to overrise their default tendency to respond in the same language as the prompt, thereby posing an additional cognitive strain. We evaluate a set of 18 LLMs, showing significant performance variations, with GPT-4.5 achieving the highest accuracy (74.7%), outperforming models like Grok-2 (67.2%), and Llama 3.1 405B (65.6%). Control experiments and difficulty scaling analyses suggest that while LLMs engage in internal reasoning, we cannot rule out heuristic exploitations under certain conditions, marking an area for future investigation. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can "think" via latent-space computations, revealing model-internal inference strategies that need further understanding, especially regarding safety-related concerns such as covert planning, goal-seeking, or deception emerging without explicit token traces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Free Token Reduction for Multi-Modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17391v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a range of multimodal tasks; however, their practical deployment is often constrained by high computational costs and prolonged inference times. Since the vision modality typically carries more information than the text modality, compressing visual prompts offers a promising solution to alleviate these challenges. Existing approaches predominantly focus on refining model architectures or directly reducing the number of visual tokens. However, these methods often compromise inference performance due to a lack of consideration for the unique spatial and temporal characteristics of visual data. In this work, we propose a token compression paradigm that operates on both spatial and temporal dimensions. Our approach includes a learning-free, plug-and-play compression pipeline that can be seamlessly integrated into most Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) frameworks. By leveraging this method, we enhance the model inference capability while simultaneously reducing its computational cost. Experimental results on the Video-QA task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing significant improvements in efficiency without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |

However, such potential also raises concerns about the safety risks of LLM-driven persuasion, particularly their potential for unethical influence through manipulation, deception, exploitation of vulnerabilities, and many other harmful tactics. In this work, we present a systematic investigation of LLM persuasion safety through two critical aspects: (1) whether LLMs appropriately reject unethical persuasion tasks and avoid unethical strategies during execution, including cases where the initial persuasion goal appears ethically neutral, and (2) how influencing factors like personality traits and external pressures affect their behavior. To this end, we introduce PersuSafety, the first comprehensive framework for the assessment of persuasion safety which consists of three stages, i.e., persuasion scene creation, persuasive conversation simulation, and persuasion safety assessment. PersuSafety covers 6 diverse unethical persuasion topics and 15 common unethical strategies. Through extensive experiments across 8 widely used LLMs, we observe significant safety concerns in most LLMs, including failing to identify harmful persuasion tasks and leveraging various unethical persuasion strategies. Our study calls for more attention to improve safety alignment in progressive and goal-driven conversations such as persuasion.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained interest for this task due to their potential to leverage embedded scientific knowledge for hypothesis generation. However, evaluating the true discovery capabilities of these methods remains challenging, as existing benchmarks often rely on common equations that are susceptible to memorization by LLMs, leading to inflated performance metrics that do not reflect discovery. In this paper, we introduce LLM-SRBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 239 challenging problems across four scientific domains specifically designed to evaluate LLM-based scientific equation discovery methods while preventing trivial memorization. Our benchmark comprises two main categories: LSR-Transform, which transforms common physical models into less common mathematical representations to test reasoning beyond memorized forms, and LSR-Synth, which introduces synthetic, discovery-driven problems requiring data-driven reasoning. Through extensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art methods, using both open and closed LLMs, we find that the best-performing system so far achieves only 31.5% symbolic accuracy. These findings highlight the challenges of scientific equation discovery, positioning LLM-SRBench as a valuable resource for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/deep-symbolic-mathematics/llm-srbench , Benchmark page: https://huggingface.co/datasets/nnheui/llm-srbench</p></details> |

At present, many instruction selection methods have been proposed, but most of these methods select instruction based on heuristic quality metrics, and only consider data selection before training. These designs lead to insufficient optimization of instruction fine-tuning, and fixed heuristic indicators are often difficult to optimize for specific tasks. So we designed a dynamic, task-objective-driven instruction selection framework RAISE(Reinforenced Adaptive Instruction SElection), which incorporates the entire instruction fine-tuning process into optimization, selecting instruction at each step based on the expected impact of instruction on model performance improvement. Our approach is well interpretable and has strong task-specific optimization capabilities. By modeling dynamic instruction selection as a sequential decision-making process, we use RL to train our selection strategy. Extensive experiments and result analysis prove the superiority of our method compared with other instruction selection methods. Notably, RAISE achieves superior performance by updating only 1\% of the training steps compared to full-data training, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

While LRMs have achieved significant breakthroughs in complex reasoning tasks through explicit chains of thought, their reliance on deep analytical thinking may limit their system 1 thinking capabilities. Moreover, a lack of benchmark currently exists to evaluate LRMs' performance in tasks that require such capabilities. To fill this gap, S1-Bench presents a set of simple, diverse, and naturally clear questions across multiple domains and languages, specifically designed to assess LRMs' performance in such tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation of 22 LRMs reveals significant lower efficiency tendencies, with outputs averaging 15.5 times longer than those of traditional small LLMs. Additionally, LRMs often identify correct answers early but continue unnecessary deliberation, with some models even producing numerous errors. These findings highlight the rigid reasoning patterns of current LRMs and underscore the substantial development needed to achieve balanced dual-system thinking capabilities that can adapt appropriately to task complexity.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

The core of R1 lies in its rule-based reward formulation, which leverages tasks with deterministic ground-truth answers to enable precise and stable reward computation. In the visual domain, we similarly observe that a wide range of visual understanding tasks are inherently equipped with well-defined ground-truth annotations. This property makes them naturally compatible with rule-based reward mechanisms. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the extension of R1-style reinforcement learning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their visual reasoning capabilities. To this end, we develop VLM-R1, a dedicated framework designed to harness RL for improving VLMs' performance on general vision-language tasks. Using this framework, we further explore the feasibility of applying RL to visual domain. Experimental results indicate that the RL-based model not only delivers competitive performance on visual understanding tasks but also surpasses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in generalization ability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies that uncover a series of noteworthy insights, including the presence of reward hacking in object detection, the emergence of the "OD aha moment", the impact of training data quality, and the scaling behavior of RL across different model sizes. Through these analyses, we aim to deepen the understanding of how reinforcement learning enhances the capabilities of vision-language models, and we hope our findings and open-source contributions will support continued progress in the vision-language RL community.

Despite the major attempts to analyze personality expression through output-based evaluations, little is known about how such traits are internally encoded within LLM parameters. In this paper, we introduce a layer-wise probing framework to systematically investigate the layer-wise capability of LLMs in encoding personality for responding. We conduct probing experiments on 11 open-source LLMs over the PersonalityEdit benchmark and find that LLMs predominantly encode personality for responding in their middle and upper layers, with instruction-tuned models demonstrating a slightly clearer separation of personality traits. Furthermore, by interpreting the trained probing hyperplane as a layer-wise boundary for each personality category, we propose a layer-wise perturbation method to edit the personality expressed by LLMs during inference. Our results show that even when the prompt explicitly specifies a particular personality, our method can still successfully alter the response personality of LLMs. Interestingly, the difficulty of converting between certain personality traits varies substantially, which aligns with the representational distances in our probing experiments. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive MMLU benchmark evaluation and time overhead analysis, demonstrating that our proposed personality editing method incurs only minimal degradation in general capabilities while maintaining low training costs and acceptable inference latency. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/universe-sky/probing-then-editing-personality.</p></details> | Working in Progress |

Notably, our analysis reveals that the hybrid strategy leverages the contextual understanding of LLMs and the high statistical reliability of traditional data-driven methods to achieve excellent feature selection performance, even surpassing LLMs and traditional data-driven methods.

However, traditional PINN models are typically designed for single PDEs, limiting their generalizability across different physical systems. In this work, we explore the potential of a foundation PINN model capable of solving multiple PDEs within a unified architecture. We investigate the efficacy of a single PINN framework trained on four distinct PDEs-the Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO), the 1D Heat Equation, the 1D Wave Equation, and the 2D Laplace Equation, demonstrating its ability to learn diverse physical dynamics. To enhance sample efficiency, we incorporate Active Learning (AL) using Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout-based uncertainty estimation, selecting the most informative training samples iteratively. We evaluate different active learning strategies, comparing models trained on 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% of the full dataset, and analyze their impact on solution accuracy. Our results indicate that targeted uncertainty sampling significantly improves performance with fewer training samples, leading to efficient learning across multiple PDEs. This work highlights the feasibility of a generalizable PINN-based foundation model, capable of adapting to different physics-based problems without redesigning network architectures. Our findings suggest that multi-PDE PINNs with active learning can serve as an effective approach for reducing computational costs while maintaining high accuracy in physics-based deep learning applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper should be rewritten</p></details> |
| **[A Complex-valued SAR Foundation Model Based on Physically Inspired Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11999v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models in remote sensing have been extensively studied due to their superior generalization on various downstream tasks. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, providing significant advantages for Earth observation. However, establishing a foundation model for SAR image interpretation inevitably encounters the challenges of insufficient information utilization and poor interpretability. In this paper, we propose a remote sensing foundation model based on complex-valued SAR data, which simulates the polarimetric decomposition process for pre-training, i.e., characterizing pixel scattering intensity as a weighted combination of scattering bases and scattering coefficients, thereby endowing the foundation model with physical interpretability. Specifically, we construct a series of scattering queries, each representing an independent and meaningful scattering basis, which interact with SAR features in the scattering query decoder and output the corresponding scattering coefficient. To guide the pre-training process, polarimetric decomposition loss and power self-supervision loss are constructed. The former aligns the predicted coefficients with Yamaguchi coefficients, while the latter reconstructs power from the predicted coefficients and compares it to the input image's power. The performance of our foundation model is validated on six typical downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Notably, the foundation model can extract stable feature representations and exhibits strong generalization, even in data-scarce conditions.</p></details> |  |

Systems like Circom simplify ZK development by combining witness computation and circuit constraints in one program. However, even small errors can compromise security of ZK programs --under-constrained circuits may accept invalid witnesses, while over-constrained ones may reject valid ones. Static analyzers are often imprecise with high false positives, and formal tools struggle with real-world circuit scale. Additionally, existing tools overlook several critical behaviors, such as intermediate computations and program aborts, and thus miss many vulnerabilities. Our theoretical contribution is the Trace-Constraint Consistency Test (TCCT), a foundational language-independent formulation of ZK circuit bugs that defines bugs as discrepancies between the execution traces of the computation and the circuit constraints. TCCT captures both intermediate computations and program aborts, detecting bugs that elude prior tools. Our systems contribution is zkFuzz, a novel program mutation-based fuzzing framework for detecting TCCT violations. zkFuzz systematically mutates the computational logic of Zk programs guided by a novel fitness function, and injects carefully crafted inputs using tailored heuristics to expose bugs. We evaluated zkFuzz on 354 real-world ZK circuits written in Circom, a leading programming system for ZK development. zkFuzz successfully identified 66 bugs, including 38 zero-days --18 of which were confirmed by developers and 6 fixed, earning bug bounties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Multi-View Stereo with Depth Foundation Model in the Absence of Real-World Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11845v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods have made remarkable progress in recent years. However, how to effectively train the network without using real-world labels remains a challenging problem. In this paper, driven by the recent advancements of vision foundation models, a novel method termed DFM-MVS, is proposed to leverage the depth foundation model to generate the effective depth prior, so as to boost MVS in the absence of real-world labels. Specifically, a depth prior-based pseudo-supervised training mechanism is developed to simulate realistic stereo correspondences using the generated depth prior, thereby constructing effective supervision for the MVS network. Besides, a depth prior-guided error correction strategy is presented to leverage the depth prior as guidance to mitigate the error propagation problem inherent in the widely-used coarse-to-fine network structure. Experimental results on DTU and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that the proposed DFM-MVS significantly outperforms existing MVS methods without using real-world labels.</p></details> |  |

We conduct a comparative analysis on various approaches for sensing force, data collection, behavior cloning, tactile representation learning, and low-level robot control. From our analysis, we articulate when and why forces are needed, and highlight opportunities to improve learning of contact-rich, generalist robot policies on the path toward highly capable touch-based robot foundation models. We generally find that while there are few tasks such as pouring, peg-in-hole insertion, and handling delicate objects, the performance of imitation learning models is not at a level of dynamics where force truly matters. Also, force and touch are abstract quantities that can be inferred through a wide range of modalities and are often measured and controlled implicitly. We hope that juxtaposing the different approaches currently in use will help the reader to gain a systemic understanding and help inspire the next generation of robot foundation models.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

However, addressing uncertainty in both perception (sensory interpretation) and decision-making (plan generation) remains a critical challenge for ensuring task reliability. We present a comprehensive framework to disentangle, quantify, and mitigate these two forms of uncertainty. We first introduce a framework for uncertainty disentanglement, isolating perception uncertainty arising from limitations in visual understanding and decision uncertainty relating to the robustness of generated plans. To quantify each type of uncertainty, we propose methods tailored to the unique properties of perception and decision-making: we use conformal prediction to calibrate perception uncertainty and introduce Formal-Methods-Driven Prediction (FMDP) to quantify decision uncertainty, leveraging formal verification techniques for theoretical guarantees. Building on this quantification, we implement two targeted intervention mechanisms: an active sensing process that dynamically re-observes high-uncertainty scenes to enhance visual input quality and an automated refinement procedure that fine-tunes the model on high-certainty data, improving its capability to meet task specifications. Empirical validation in real-world and simulated robotic tasks demonstrates that our uncertainty disentanglement framework reduces variability by up to 40% and enhances task success rates by 5% compared to baselines. These improvements are attributed to the combined effect of both interventions and highlight the importance of uncertainty disentanglement, which facilitates targeted interventions that enhance the robustness and reliability of autonomous systems.

However, such solutions are not yet available for Tetun, making it challenging to find relevant documents for text-based search queries in this language. To address these challenges, this study investigates Tetun text retrieval with a focus on the ad-hoc retrieval task. It begins by developing essential language resources -- including a list of stopwords, a stemmer, and a test collection -- which serve as foundational components for solutions tailored to Tetun text retrieval. Various strategies are then explored using both document titles and content to evaluate retrieval effectiveness. The results show that retrieving document titles, after removing hyphens and apostrophes without applying stemming, significantly improves retrieval performance compared to the baseline. Efficiency increases by 31.37%, while effectiveness achieves an average gain of 9.40% in MAP@10 and 30.35% in nDCG@10 with DFR BM25. Beyond the top-10 cutoff point, Hiemstra LM demonstrates strong performance across various retrieval strategies and evaluation metrics. Contributions of this work include the development of Labadain-Stopwords (a list of 160 Tetun stopwords), Labadain-Stemmer (a Tetun stemmer with three variants), and Labadain-Avaliad\'or (a Tetun test collection containing 59 topics, 33,550 documents, and 5,900 qrels).</p></details> | Version 3 |

Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry (REIMS), a tool for real-time intraoperative margin assessment, generates spectra that require machine learning models to support clinical decision-making. However, the scarcity of labeled data in surgical contexts presents a significant challenge. This study is the first to develop a foundation model tailored specifically for REIMS data, addressing this limitation and advancing real-time surgical margin assessment. Methods: We propose FACT, a Foundation model for Assessing Cancer Tissue margins. FACT is an adaptation of a foundation model originally designed for text-audio association, pretrained using our proposed supervised contrastive approach based on triplet loss. An ablation study is performed to compare our proposed model against other models and pretraining methods. Results: Our proposed model significantly improves the classification performance, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an AUROC of $82.4\% \pm 0.8$. The results demonstrate the advantage of our proposed pretraining method and selected backbone over the self-supervised and semi-supervised baselines and alternative models. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that foundation models, adapted and pretrained using our novel approach, can effectively classify REIMS data even with limited labeled examples. This highlights the viability of foundation models for enhancing real-time surgical margin assessment, particularly in data-scarce clinical environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Whole-Body Humanoid Control via Behavioral Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11054v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) aims at pre-training agents that can solve a wide range of downstream tasks in complex environments. Despite recent advancements, existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they may require running an RL process on each downstream task to achieve a satisfactory performance, they may need access to datasets with good coverage or well-curated task-specific samples, or they may pre-train policies with unsupervised losses that are poorly correlated with the downstream tasks of interest. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm regularizing unsupervised RL towards imitating trajectories from unlabeled behavior datasets. The key technical novelty of our method, called Forward-Backward Representations with Conditional-Policy Regularization, is to train forward-backward representations to embed the unlabeled trajectories to the same latent space used to represent states, rewards, and policies, and use a latent-conditional discriminator to encourage policies to ``cover'' the states in the unlabeled behavior dataset. As a result, we can learn policies that are well aligned with the behaviors in the dataset, while retaining zero-shot generalization capabilities for reward-based and imitation tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach in a challenging humanoid control problem: leveraging observation-only motion capture datasets, we train Meta Motivo, the first humanoid behavioral foundation model that can be prompted to solve a variety of whole-body tasks, including motion tracking, goal reaching, and reward optimization. The resulting model is capable of expressing human-like behaviors and it achieves competitive performance with task-specific methods while outperforming state-of-the-art unsupervised RL and model-based baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Distribution Gaps in Time Series Foundation Model Pretraining with Prototype-Guided Normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10900v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across diverse machine-learning domains through large-scale pretraining on large, diverse datasets. However, pretraining on such datasets introduces significant challenges due to substantial mismatches in data distributions, a problem particularly pronounced with time series data. In this paper, we tackle this issue by proposing a domain-aware adaptive normalization strategy within the Transformer architecture. Specifically, we replace the traditional LayerNorm with a prototype-guided dynamic normalization mechanism (ProtoNorm), where learned prototypes encapsulate distinct data distributions, and sample-to-prototype affinity determines the appropriate normalization layer. This mechanism effectively captures the heterogeneity of time series characteristics, aligning pretrained representations with downstream tasks. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional pretraining techniques across both classification and forecasting tasks, while effectively mitigating the adverse effects of distribution shifts during pretraining. Incorporating ProtoNorm is as simple as replacing a single line of code. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world time series benchmarks validate the robustness and generalizability of our approach, advancing the development of more versatile time series foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce SE Arena, an interactive platform designed to evaluate SE-focused chatbots. SE Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including the consistency score that measures model consistency through self-play matches. Moreover, SE Arena incorporates a new feature called RepoChat, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SE Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |
| **[Mamba as a Bridge: Where Vision Foundation Models Meet Vision Language Models for Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03193v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained traction in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) due to their strong generalization capabilities. However, existing DGSS methods often rely exclusively on either VFMs or VLMs, overlooking their complementary strengths. VFMs (e.g., DINOv2) excel at capturing fine-grained features, while VLMs (e.g., CLIP) provide robust text alignment but struggle with coarse granularity. Despite their complementary strengths, effectively integrating VFMs and VLMs with attention mechanisms is challenging, as the increased patch tokens complicate long-sequence modeling. To address this, we propose MFuser, a novel Mamba-based fusion framework that efficiently combines the strengths of VFMs and VLMs while maintaining linear scalability in sequence length. MFuser consists of two key components: MVFuser, which acts as a co-adapter to jointly fine-tune the two models by capturing both sequential and spatial dynamics; and MTEnhancer, a hybrid attention-Mamba module that refines text embeddings by incorporating image priors. Our approach achieves precise feature locality and strong text alignment without incurring significant computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MFuser significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS methods, achieving 68.20 mIoU on synthetic-to-real and 71.87 mIoU on real-to-real benchmarks.

However, due to the high computation complexity of adversarial training, it is not feasible to fine-tune the foundation model to improve its robustness on the downstream task. Observing the above challenge, we want to improve the downstream robustness without updating/accessing the weights in the foundation model. Inspired from existing literature in robustness inheritance (Kim et al., 2020), through theoretical investigation, we identify a close relationship between robust contrastive learning with the adversarial robustness of supervised learning. To further validate and utilize this theoretical insight, we design a simple-yet-effective robust auto-encoder as a data pre-processing method before feeding the data into the foundation model. The proposed approach has zero access to the foundation model when training the robust auto-encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the robustness of downstream tasks, verifying the connection between the feature robustness (implied by small adversarial contrastive loss) and the robustness of the downstream task.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 2 figures, 12 tables.

This is primarily due to the inherent data variability and diversity of downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel universal 3D pre-training framework designed to facilitate the acquisition of efficient 3D representation, thereby establishing a pathway to 3D foundational models. Considering that informative 3D features should encode rich geometry and appearance cues that can be utilized to render realistic images, we propose to learn 3D representations by differentiable neural rendering. We train a 3D backbone with a devised volumetric neural renderer by comparing the rendered with the real images. Notably, our approach seamlessly integrates the learned 3D encoder into various downstream tasks. These tasks encompass not only high-level challenges such as 3D detection and segmentation but also low-level objectives like 3D reconstruction and image synthesis, spanning both indoor and outdoor scenarios. Besides, we also illustrate the capability of pre-training a 2D backbone using the proposed methodology, surpassing conventional pre-training methods by a large margin. For the first time, PonderV2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 indoor and outdoor benchmarks, implying its effectiveness.

Video datasets, however, are often released as extracted features (i.e., tabular data) rather than raw footage due to privacy and ethical concerns. Prior research on such tabular datasets established tree-based classical machine learning approaches as the best-performing models. Motivated by the recent success of textual foundation models (i.e., large language models), we explore the use of tabular foundation models in empathy detection from tabular visual features. We experiment with two recent tabular foundation models $-$ TabPFN v2 and TabICL $-$ through in-context learning and fine-tuning setups. Our experiments on a public human-robot interaction benchmark demonstrate a significant boost in cross-subject empathy detection accuracy over several strong baselines (accuracy: $0.590 \rightarrow 0.730$; AUC: $0.564 \rightarrow 0.669$). In addition to performance improvement, we contribute novel insights and an evaluation setup to ensure generalisation on unseen subjects in this public benchmark. As the practice of releasing video features as tabular datasets is likely to persist due to privacy constraints, our findings will be widely applicable to future empathy detection video datasets as well.</p></details> |  |

These models facilitate the understanding of matter and the discovery of new molecules and materials. In contrast to GNNs operating on a large homogeneous graphs, GNNs used by CFMs process a large number of geometric graphs of varying sizes, requiring different optimization strategies than those developed for large homogeneous GNNs. This paper presents optimizations for two critical phases of CFM training: data distribution and model training, targeting MACE - a state-of-the-art CFM. We address the challenge of load balancing in data distribution by formulating it as a multi-objective bin packing problem. We propose an iterative algorithm that provides a highly effective, fast, and practical solution, ensuring efficient data distribution. For the training phase, we identify symmetric tensor contraction as the key computational kernel in MACE and optimize this kernel to improve the overall performance. Our combined approach of balanced data distribution and kernel optimization significantly enhances the training process of MACE. Experimental results demonstrate a substantial speedup, reducing per-epoch execution time for training from 12 to 2 minutes on 740 GPUs with a 2.6M sample dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The 34th ACM International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC 2025)</p></details> |

The success of these models can be attributed to their ability to effectively learn latent representations of atomic structures directly from the training data. Conversely, this also results in high data requirements for these models, hindering their application to problems which are data sparse which are common in this domain. To address this limitation, there is a growing development in the area of pre-trained machine learning models which have learned general, fundamental, geometric relationships in atomistic data, and which can then be fine-tuned to much smaller application-specific datasets. In particular, models which are pre-trained on diverse, large-scale atomistic datasets have shown impressive generalizability and flexibility to downstream applications, and are increasingly referred to as atomistic foundation models. To leverage the untapped potential of these foundation models, we introduce MatterTune, a modular and extensible framework that provides advanced fine-tuning capabilities and seamless integration of atomistic foundation models into downstream materials informatics and simulation workflows, thereby lowering the barriers to adoption and facilitating diverse applications in materials science. In its current state, MatterTune supports a number of state-of-the-art foundation models such as ORB, MatterSim, JMP, and EquformerV2, and hosts a wide range of features including a modular and flexible design, distributed and customizable fine-tuning, broad support for downstream informatics tasks, and more.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigated what these models learn and evaluated the transferability of an FM trained on MIMIC-IV to an institutional EHR dataset at the University of Chicago Medical Center. We assessed their ability to identify outlier patients and examined representation-space patient trajectories in relation to future clinical outcomes. We also evaluated the performance of supervised fine-tuned classifiers on both source and target datasets. Our findings offer insights into the adaptability of FMs across different healthcare systems, highlight considerations for their effective implementation, and provide an empirical analysis of the underlying factors that contribute to their predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Satellite Federated Fine-Tuning for Foundation Models in Space Computing Power Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10403v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites have promoted the application of large remote sensing foundation models for various downstream tasks. However, direct downloading of these models for fine-tuning on the ground is impeded by privacy concerns and limited bandwidth. Satellite federated learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling model fine-tuning directly on-board satellites and aggregating model updates without data downloading. Nevertheless, for large foundation models, the computational capacity of satellites is insufficient to support effective on-board fine-tuning in traditional satellite FL frameworks. To address these challenges, we propose a satellite-ground collaborative federated fine-tuning framework. The key of the framework lies in how to reasonably decompose and allocate model components to alleviate insufficient on-board computation capabilities. During fine-tuning, satellites exchange intermediate results with ground stations or other satellites for forward propagation and back propagation, which brings communication challenges due to the special communication topology of space transmission networks, such as intermittent satellite-ground communication, short duration of satellite-ground communication windows, and unstable inter-orbit inter-satellite links (ISLs). To reduce transmission delays, we further introduce tailored communication strategies that integrate both communication and computing resources. Specifically, we propose a parallel intra-orbit communication strategy, a topology-aware satellite-ground communication strategy, and a latency-minimalization inter-orbit communication strategy to reduce space communication costs. Simulation results demonstrate significant reductions in training time with improvements of approximately 33%.</p></details> |  |

As recommender systems increasingly incorporate these modalities, leveraging MFMs to generate better representations has great potential. However, their application in sequential recommendation remains largely unexplored. This is primarily because mainstream adaptation methods, such as Fine-Tuning and even Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques (e.g., Adapter and LoRA), incur high computational costs, especially when integrating multiple modality encoders, thus hindering research progress. As a result, it remains unclear whether we can efficiently and effectively adapt multiple (>2) MFMs for the sequential recommendation task. To address this, we propose a plug-and-play Cross-modal Side Adapter Network (CROSSAN). Leveraging the fully decoupled side adapter-based paradigm, CROSSAN achieves high efficiency while enabling cross-modal learning across diverse modalities. To optimize the final stage of multimodal fusion across diverse modalities, we adopt the Mixture of Modality Expert Fusion (MOMEF) mechanism. CROSSAN achieves superior performance on the public datasets for adapting four foundation models with raw modalities. Performance consistently improves as more MFMs are adapted. We will release our code and datasets to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  |

The generalization ability of foundation models is crucial for the success in various downstream clinical tasks. However, current foundation models have only been evaluated on a limited type and number of tasks, leaving their generalization ability and overall performance unclear. To address this gap, we established a most comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf foundation models across six distinct clinical task types, encompassing a total of 72 specific tasks, including slide-level classification, survival prediction, ROI-tissue classification, ROI retrieval, visual question answering, and report generation. Our findings reveal that existing foundation models excel at certain task types but struggle to effectively handle the full breadth of clinical tasks. To improve the generalization of pathology foundation models, we propose a unified knowledge distillation framework consisting of both expert and self-knowledge distillation, where the former allows the model to learn from the knowledge of multiple expert models, while the latter leverages self-distillation to enable image representation learning via local-global alignment. Based on this framework, we curated a dataset of 96,000 whole slide images (WSIs) and developed a Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model (GPFM). This advanced model was trained on a substantial dataset comprising 190 million images extracted from approximately 72,000 publicly available slides, encompassing 34 major tissue types. Evaluated on the established benchmark, GPFM achieves an impressive average rank of 1.6, with 42 tasks ranked 1st, while the second-best model, UNI, attains an average rank of 3.7, with only 6 tasks ranked 1st.</p></details> | update |
| **[Enhancing Multi-task Learning Capability of Medical Generalist Foundation Model via Image-centric Multi-annotation Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09967v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of medical generalist foundation models has revolutionized conventional task-specific model development paradigms, aiming to better handle multiple tasks through joint training on large-scale medical datasets. However, recent advances prioritize simple data scaling or architectural component enhancement, while neglecting to re-examine multi-task learning from a data-centric perspective. Critically, simply aggregating existing data resources leads to decentralized image-task alignment, which fails to cultivate comprehensive image understanding or align with clinical needs for multi-dimensional image interpretation. In this paper, we introduce the image-centric multi-annotation X-ray dataset (IMAX), the first attempt to enhance the multi-task learning capabilities of medical multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) from the data construction level. To be specific, IMAX is featured from the following attributes: 1) High-quality data curation. A comprehensive collection of more than 354K entries applicable to seven different medical tasks. 2) Image-centric dense annotation. Each X-ray image is associated with an average of 4.10 tasks and 7.46 training entries, ensuring multi-task representation richness per image. Compared to the general decentralized multi-annotation X-ray dataset (DMAX), IMAX consistently demonstrates significant multi-task average performance gains ranging from 3.20% to 21.05% across seven open-source state-of-the-art medical MLLMs. Moreover, we investigate differences in statistical patterns exhibited by IMAX and DMAX training processes, exploring potential correlations between optimization dynamics and multi-task performance. Finally, leveraging the core concept of IMAX data construction, we propose an optimized DMAX-based training strategy to alleviate the dilemma of obtaining high-quality IMAX data in practical scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies indicate that scaling-up and advanced design of the recommendation model can bring significant performance improvement. However, with a larger model scale, such prior studies have a significantly increasing gap from industry as they often neglect two fundamental challenges in industrial-scale applications. First, training and inference budgets are restricted for the model to be served, exceeding which may incur latency and impair user experience. Second, large-volume data arrive in a streaming mode with data distributions dynamically shifting, as new users/ads join and existing users/ads leave the system. We propose the External Large Foundation Model (ExFM) framework to address the overlooked challenges. Specifically, we develop external distillation and a data augmentation system (DAS) to control the computational cost of training/inference while maintaining high performance. We design the teacher in a way like a foundation model (FM) that can serve multiple students as vertical models (VMs) to amortize its building cost. We propose Auxiliary Head and Student Adapter to mitigate the data distribution gap between FM and VMs caused by the streaming data issue. Comprehensive experiments on internal industrial-scale applications and public datasets demonstrate significant performance gain by ExFM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the ACM Web Conference (WWW) 2025 Industrial Track as Oral Presentation</p></details> |

| **[OVERLORD: Ultimate Scaling of DataLoader for Multi-Source Large Foundation Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09844v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern frameworks for training large foundation models (LFMs) employ data loaders in a data parallel paradigm. While this design offers implementation simplicity, it introduces two fundamental challenges. First, due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention operator, the non-uniform sample distribution over data-parallel ranks leads to a significant workload imbalance among loaders, which degrades the training efficiency. This paradigm also impedes the implementation of data mixing algorithms (e.g., curriculum learning) over different datasets. Second, to acquire a broad range of capability, LFMs training ingests data from diverse sources, each with distinct file access states. Colocating massive datasets within loader instances can easily exceed local pod memory capacity. Additionally, heavy sources with higher transformation latency require larger worker pools, further exacerbating memory consumption. We present OVERLORD, an industrial-grade distributed data loading architecture with three innovations: (1) A centralized and declarative data plane, which facilitates elastic data orchestration strategy, such as long-short context, multimodal, and curriculum learning; (2) Disaggregated multisource preprocessing through role-specific actors, i.e., Source Loaders and Data Constructors, leveraging autoscaling for Source Loaders towards heterogeneous and evolving source preprocessing cost; (3) Shadow Loaders with differential checkpointing for uninterrupted fault recovery. Deployed on production clusters scaling to multi-thousand GPU, OVERLORD achieves: (1) 4.5x end-to-end training throughput improvement, (2) a minimum 3.6x reduction in CPU memory usage, with further improvements to be added in later experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied Chain of Action Reasoning with Multi-Modal Foundation Model for Humanoid Loco-manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09532v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling humanoid robots to autonomously perform loco-manipulation tasks in complex, unstructured environments poses significant challenges. This entails equipping robots with the capability to plan actions over extended horizons while leveraging multi-modality to bridge gaps between high-level planning and actual task execution. Recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models have showcased substantial potential in enhancing planning and reasoning abilities, particularly in the comprehension and processing of semantic information for robotic control tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework based on foundation models that applies the embodied chain of action reasoning methodology to autonomously plan actions from textual instructions for humanoid loco-manipulation. Our method integrates humanoid-specific chain of thought methodology, including detailed affordance and body movement analysis, which provides a breakdown of the task into a sequence of locomotion and manipulation actions. Moreover, we incorporate spatial reasoning based on the observation and target object properties to effectively navigate where target position may be unseen or occluded. Through rigorous experimental setups on object rearrangement, manipulations and loco-manipulation tasks on a real-world environment, we evaluate our method's efficacy on the decoupled upper and lower body control and demonstrate the effectiveness of the chain of robotic action reasoning strategies in comprehending human instructions.</p></details> |  |

Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wjq-learning/CBraMod.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

Therefore, redefining modes of collaboration between devices and agents, and constructing native intelligence libraries become critically important in 6G. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of achieving 6G native AI from the perspectives of data, AI models, and operational paradigm. Then, we propose a 6G native AI framework based on foundation models, provide an integration method for the expert knowledge, present the customization for two kinds of PFM, and outline a novel operational paradigm for the native AI framework. As a practical use case, we apply this framework for orchestration, achieving the maximum sum rate within a cell-free massive MIMO system, and presenting preliminary evaluation results. Finally, we outline research directions for achieving native AI in 6G.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

However, existing pre-trained circuit models are typically limited to standalone encoders for predictive tasks or decoders for generative tasks. These two model types are developed independently, operate on different circuit modalities, and reside in separate latent spaces, which restricts their ability to complement each other for more advanced applications. In this work, we present GenEDA, the first framework that aligns circuit encoders with decoders within a shared latent space. GenEDA bridges the gap between graph-based circuit representations and text-based large language models (LLMs), enabling communication between their respective latent spaces. To achieve the alignment, we propose two paradigms that support both open-source trainable LLMs and commercial frozen LLMs. Built on this aligned architecture, GenEDA enables three unprecedented generative reasoning tasks over netlists, where the model reversely generates the high-level functionality from low-level netlists in different granularities. These tasks extend traditional gate-type prediction to direct generation of full-circuit functionality. Experiments demonstrate that GenEDA significantly boosts advanced LLMs' (e.g., GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3) performance in all tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> |

OCL's self-supervision of reconstructing the input from these aggregated slots struggles with complex object textures, thus Vision Foundation Model (VFM) representations are used as the aggregation input and reconstruction target. However, existing methods leverage VFM representations in diverse ways and often fail to fully exploit their potential. In response, we propose a clean architecture -- Vector-Quantized VFMs for OCL (VQ-VFM-OCL, or VVO) -- that unifies mainstream OCL methods. The key to our unification is simple yet effective, just shared quantizing the same VFM representation as the reconstruction target. Through mathematical modeling and statistical verification, we further analyze why VFM representations facilitate OCL aggregation and how their shared quantization as reconstruction targets strengthens OCL supervision. Experiments show that across different VFMs, aggregators and decoders, our VVO consistently outperforms baselines in object discovery and recognition, as well as downstream visual prediction and reasoning.

While current deep learning models excel at specific tasks like skin cancer diagnosis from dermoscopic images, they struggle to meet the complex, multimodal requirements of clinical practice. Here, we introduce PanDerm, a multimodal dermatology foundation model pretrained through self-supervised learning on over 2 million real-world skin disease images from 11 clinical institutions across 4 imaging modalities. We evaluated PanDerm on 28 diverse benchmarks, including skin cancer screening, risk stratification, differential diagnosis of common and rare skin conditions, lesion segmentation, longitudinal monitoring, and metastasis prediction and prognosis. PanDerm achieved state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated tasks, often outperforming existing models when using only 10% of labeled data. We conducted three reader studies to assess PanDerm's potential clinical utility. PanDerm outperformed clinicians by 10.2% in early-stage melanoma detection through longitudinal analysis, improved clinicians' skin cancer diagnostic accuracy by 11% on dermoscopy images, and enhanced non-dermatologist healthcare providers' differential diagnosis by 16.5% across 128 skin conditions on clinical photographs. These results demonstrate PanDerm's potential to improve patient care across diverse clinical scenarios and serve as a model for developing multimodal foundation models in other medical specialties, potentially accelerating the integration of AI support in healthcare.

Existing pre-trained solutions rely on graph learning with complex functional supervision, such as truth table simulation. However, they only handle simple and-inverter graphs (AIGs), struggling to fully encode other complex gate functionalities. While large language models (LLMs) excel at functional understanding, they lack the structural awareness for flattened netlists. To advance netlist representation learning, we present NetTAG, a netlist foundation model that fuses gate semantics with graph structure, handling diverse gate types and supporting a variety of functional and physical tasks. Moving beyond existing graph-only methods, NetTAG formulates netlists as text-attributed graphs, with gates annotated by symbolic logic expressions and physical characteristics as text attributes. Its multimodal architecture combines an LLM-based text encoder for gate semantics and a graph transformer for global structure. Pre-trained with gate and graph self-supervised objectives and aligned with RTL and layout stages, NetTAG captures comprehensive circuit intrinsics. Experimental results show that NetTAG consistently outperforms each task-specific method on four largely different functional and physical tasks and surpasses state-of-the-art AIG encoders, demonstrating its versatility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2025</p></details> |

This raises an important question: How can we train a graph foundational model on multiple source domains and adapt to an unseen target domain? A major obstacle is that graphs from different domains often exhibit divergent characteristics. Some studies leverage large language models to align multiple domains based on textual descriptions associated with the graphs, limiting their applicability to text-attributed graphs. For text-free graphs, a few recent works attempt to align different feature distributions across domains, while generally neglecting structural differences. In this work, we propose a novel Structure Alignment framework for text-free Multi-domain Graph Pre-Training and cross-domain adaptation (SAMGPT). It is designed to learn multi-domain knowledge from graphs originating in multiple source domains, which can then be adapted to address applications in an unseen target domain. Specifically, we introduce a set of structure tokens to harmonize structure-based aggregation across source domains during the pre-training phase. Next, for cross-domain adaptation, we design dual prompts, namely, holistic prompts and specific prompts, which adapt unified multi-domain structural knowledge and fine-grained, domain-specific information, respectively, to a target domain. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on seven public datasets to evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of SAMGPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW2025 Main Track</p></details> |
| **[Parameter-Free Fine-tuning via Redundancy Elimination for Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08915v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (VFMs) are large pre-trained models that form the backbone of various vision tasks. Fine-tuning VFMs can further unlock their potential for downstream tasks or scenarios. However, VFMs often contain significant feature redundancy, which may limit their adaptability to new tasks. In this paper, we investigate the redundancies in the segment anything model (SAM) and then propose a parameter-free fine-tuning method to address this issue. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods that adjust parameters, our method emphasizes selecting, reusing, and enhancing pre-trained features, offering a new perspective on model fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce a channel selection algorithm based on the model's output difference to identify redundant and effective channels. By selectively replacing the redundant channels with more effective ones, we filter out less useful features and reuse the more relevant features to downstream tasks, thereby enhancing the task-specific feature representation. Experiments on both out-of-domain and in-domain datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method. Notably, our approach can seamlessly integrate with existing fine-tuning strategies (e.g., LoRA, Adapter), further boosting the performance of already fine-tuned models. Moreover, since our channel selection involves only model inference, our method significantly reduces computational and GPU memory overhead.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies show that token distributions in foundation models exhibit scale-free properties, suggesting that hyperbolic space is a more suitable ambient space than Euclidean space for many pre-training and downstream tasks. However, existing tools lack essential components for building hyperbolic foundation models, making it difficult to leverage recent advancements. We introduce HyperCore, a comprehensive open-source framework that provides core modules for constructing hyperbolic foundation models across multiple modalities. HyperCore's modules can be effortlessly combined to develop novel hyperbolic foundation models, eliminating the need to extensively modify Euclidean modules from scratch and possible redundant research efforts. To demonstrate its versatility, we build and test the first fully hyperbolic vision transformers (LViT) with a fine-tuning pipeline, the first fully hyperbolic multimodal CLIP model (L-CLIP), and a hybrid Graph RAG with a hyperbolic graph encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that LViT outperforms its Euclidean counterpart. Additionally, we benchmark and reproduce experiments across hyperbolic GNNs, CNNs, Transformers, and vision Transformers to highlight HyperCore's advantages.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Given SAM's wide applications, understanding its robustness against adversarial attacks is crucial for real-world deployment. However, research on SAM's robustness is still in its early stages. Existing attacks often overlook the role of prompts in evaluating SAM's robustness, and there has been insufficient exploration of defense methods to balance the robustness and accuracy. To address these gaps, this paper proposes an adversarial robustness framework designed to evaluate and enhance the robustness of SAM. Specifically, we introduce a cross-prompt attack method to enhance the attack transferability across different prompt types. Besides attacking, we propose a few-parameter adaptation strategy to defend SAM against various adversarial attacks. To balance robustness and accuracy, we use the singular value decomposition (SVD) to constrain the space of trainable parameters, where only singular values are adaptable. Experiments demonstrate that our cross-prompt attack method outperforms previous approaches in terms of attack success rate on both SAM and SAM 2. By adapting only 512 parameters, we achieve at least a 15\% improvement in mean intersection over union (mIoU) against various adversarial attacks. Compared to previous defense methods, our approach enhances the robustness of SAM while maximally maintaining its original performance.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |

However, recent literature has demonstrated that this choice comes with fundamental limitations. At a large scale, real-world data often exhibit inherently non-Euclidean structures, such as multi-way relationships, hierarchies, symmetries, and non-isotropic scaling, in a variety of domains, such as languages, vision, and the natural sciences. It is challenging to effectively capture these structures within the constraints of Euclidean spaces. This position paper argues that moving beyond Euclidean geometry is not merely an optional enhancement but a necessity to maintain the scaling law for the next-generation of foundation models. By adopting these geometries, foundation models could more efficiently leverage the aforementioned structures. Task-aware adaptability that dynamically reconfigures embeddings to match the geometry of downstream applications could further enhance efficiency and expressivity. Our position is supported by a series of theoretical and empirical investigations of prevalent foundation models.Finally, we outline a roadmap for integrating non-Euclidean geometries into foundation models, including strategies for building geometric foundation models via fine-tuning, training from scratch, and hybrid approaches.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |

However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems.

In this position paper, we systematically examine the convergence of FRSs and FMs, illustrating how FM-enhanced frameworks can substantially improve client-side personalization, communication efficiency, and server-side aggregation. We also delve into pivotal challenges introduced by this integration, including privacy-security trade-offs, non-IID data, and resource constraints in federated setups, and propose prospective research directions in areas such as multimodal recommendation, real-time FM adaptation, and explainable federated reasoning.

Despite the rapid advances, there exists a fundamental limitation: Processing unseen medical codes out of the vocabulary. This problem limits the generality of EHR foundation models and the integration of models trained with different vocabularies. To deal with this problem, we propose MedRep for EHR foundation models based on the observational medical outcome partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM), providing the integrated medical concept representations and the basic data augmentation strategy for patient trajectories. For concept representation learning, we enrich the information of each concept with a minimal definition through large language model (LLM) prompts and enhance the text-based representations through graph ontology of OMOP vocabulary. Trajectory augmentation randomly replaces selected concepts with other similar concepts that have closely related representations to let the model practice with the concepts out-of-vocabulary. Finally, we demonstrate that EHR foundation models trained with MedRep better maintain the prediction performance in external datasets. Our code implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/kicarussays/MedRep.</p></details> | Under review |

The framework comprises three parts: data processing, foundation system, and downstream applications. First, we comprehensively present our data processing pipeline, which transforms massive raw audio into a large-scale high-quality TTS dataset with rich annotations and a wide coverage of content, speaking style, and timbre. Then, we propose a language-model-based foundation TTS system. The speech signal is compressed into discrete semantic tokens via a semantic-aware speech tokenizer, and can be generated by a language model from the prompt text and audio. Then, a two-stage waveform generator is proposed to decode them to the high-fidelity waveform. We present two applications of this system: voice cloning for dubbing and human-like speech generation for chatbots. The experimental results demonstrate the solid in-context learning capability of FireRedTTS, which can stably synthesize high-quality speech consistent with the prompt text and audio. For dubbing, FireRedTTS can clone target voices in a zero-shot way for the UGC scenario and adapt to studio-level expressive voice characters in the PUGC scenario via few-shot fine-tuning with 1-hour recording. Moreover, FireRedTTS achieves controllable human-like speech generation in a casual style with paralinguistic behaviors and emotions via instruction tuning, to better serve spoken chatbots.</p></details> |  |

Still, they face limitations in tasks requiring specific, structured knowledge, flexibility, or accountable decision-making. While agents are capable of perceiving their environments, forming inferences, planning, and executing actions towards goals, they often face issues such as hallucinations and lack of contextual memory across interactions. This paper explores how Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), a strategy that solves new problems by referencing past experiences, can be integrated into LLM agent frameworks. This integration allows LLMs to leverage explicit knowledge, enhancing their effectiveness. We systematically review the theoretical foundations of these enhanced agents, identify critical framework components, and formulate a mathematical model for the CBR processes of case retrieval, adaptation, and learning. We also evaluate CBR-enhanced agents against other methods like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation, analyzing their relative strengths. Moreover, we explore how leveraging CBR's cognitive dimensions (including self-reflection, introspection, and curiosity) via goal-driven autonomy mechanisms can further enhance the LLM agent capabilities. Contributing to the ongoing research on neuro-symbolic hybrid systems, this work posits CBR as a viable technique for enhancing the reasoning skills and cognitive aspects of autonomous LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

Annotating medical images is costly and requires domain expertise, limiting large-scale annotated data availability. To address this, we propose SynthFM, a synthetic data generation framework that mimics the complexities of medical images, enabling foundation models to adapt without real medical data. Using SAM's pretrained encoder and training the decoder from scratch on SynthFM's dataset, we evaluated our method on 11 anatomical structures across 9 datasets (CT, MRI, and Ultrasound). SynthFM outperformed zero-shot baselines like SAM and MedSAM, achieving superior results under different prompt settings and on out-of-distribution datasets.</p></details> |  |

Much of this early progress rests on the foundations and standard practices of traditional reinforcement learning, without questioning if they are well-suited to the challenges of continual learning agents. We suggest that many core foundations of traditional RL are, in fact, antithetical to the goals of continual reinforcement learning. We enumerate four such foundations: the Markov decision process formalism, a focus on optimal policies, the expected sum of rewards as the primary evaluation metric, and episodic benchmark environments that embrace the other three foundations. Shedding such sacredly held and taught concepts is not easy. They are self-reinforcing in that each foundation depends upon and holds up the others, making it hard to rethink each in isolation. We propose an alternative set of all four foundations that are better suited to the continual learning setting. We hope to spur on others in rethinking the traditional foundations, proposing and critiquing alternatives, and developing new algorithms and approaches enabled by better-suited foundations.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent complexity and high dimensionality of cellular responses, combined with the extremely limited available experimental data, makes the task challenging. In this study, we leverage single-cell foundation models (FMs) pre-trained on tens of millions of single cells, encompassing multiple cell types, states, and disease annotations, to address molecular perturbation prediction. We introduce a drug-conditional adapter that allows efficient fine-tuning by training less than 1% of the original foundation model, thus enabling molecular conditioning while preserving the rich biological representation learned during pre-training. The proposed strategy allows not only the prediction of cellular responses to novel drugs, but also the zero-shot generalization to unseen cell lines. We establish a robust evaluation framework to assess model performance across different generalization tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results across all settings, with significant improvements in the few-shot and zero-shot generalization to new cell lines compared to existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Adaptation with Behavioral Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07896v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for pretraining behavioral foundation models (BFMs), enabling agents to solve a wide range of downstream tasks specified via reward functions in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without additional test-time learning or planning. This is achieved by learning self-supervised task embeddings alongside corresponding near-optimal behaviors and incorporating an inference procedure to directly retrieve the latent task embedding and associated policy for any given reward function. Despite promising results, zero-shot policies are often suboptimal due to errors induced by the unsupervised training process, the embedding, and the inference procedure. In this paper, we focus on devising fast adaptation strategies to improve the zero-shot performance of BFMs in a few steps of online interaction with the environment while avoiding any performance drop during the adaptation process. Notably, we demonstrate that existing BFMs learn a set of skills containing more performant policies than those identified by their inference procedure, making them well-suited for fast adaptation. Motivated by this observation, we propose both actor-critic and actor-only fast adaptation strategies that search in the low-dimensional task-embedding space of the pre-trained BFM to rapidly improve the performance of its zero-shot policies on any downstream task. Notably, our approach mitigates the initial "unlearning" phase commonly observed when fine-tuning pre-trained RL models. We evaluate our fast adaptation strategies on top of four state-of-the-art zero-shot RL methods in multiple navigation and locomotion domains. Our results show that they achieve 10-40% improvement over their zero-shot performance in a few tens of episodes, outperforming existing baselines.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[FAST: Federated Active Learning with Foundation Models for Communication-efficient Sampling and Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03783v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Active Learning (FAL) has emerged as a promising framework to leverage large quantities of unlabeled data across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, real-world deployments remain limited by high annotation costs and communication-intensive sampling processes, particularly in a cross-silo setting, when clients possess substantial local datasets. This paper addresses the crucial question: What is the best practice to reduce communication costs in human-in-the-loop learning with minimal annotator effort? Existing FAL methods typically rely on iterative annotation processes that separate active sampling from federated updates, leading to multiple rounds of expensive communication and annotation. In response, we introduce FAST, a two-pass FAL framework that harnesses foundation models for weak labeling in a preliminary pass, followed by a refinement pass focused exclusively on the most uncertain samples. By leveraging representation knowledge from foundation models and integrating refinement steps into a streamlined workflow, FAST substantially reduces the overhead incurred by iterative active sampling. Extensive experiments on diverse medical and natural image benchmarks demonstrate that FAST outperforms existing FAL methods by an average of 4.36% while reducing communication rounds eightfold under a limited 5% labeling budget.</p></details> |  |

Existing conceptual models for visual and multimedia analytics, however, do not adequately capture the complexity introduced by these powerful AI paradigms. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive multimedia analytics model specifically designed for the foundation model era. Building upon established frameworks from visual analytics, multimedia analytics, knowledge generation, analytic task definition, mixed-initiative guidance, and human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning, our model emphasizes integrated human-AI teaming based on visual analytics agents from both technical and conceptual perspectives. Central to the model is a seamless, yet explicitly separable, interaction channel between expert users and semi-autonomous analytical processes, ensuring continuous alignment between user intent and AI behavior. The model addresses practical challenges in sensitive domains such as intelligence analysis, investigative journalism, and other fields handling complex, high-stakes data. We illustrate through detailed case studies how our model facilitates deeper understanding and targeted improvement of multimedia analytics solutions. By explicitly capturing how expert users can optimally interact with and guide AI-powered multimedia analytics systems, our conceptual framework sets a clear direction for system design, comparison, and future research.</p></details> |  |

Our study spans embeddings from pre-trained convolutional and transformer models trained via supervised, self-supervised, and text-image contrastive learning. We assess full fine-tuning and transfer learning (top-tuning) on six diverse e-Commerce datasets: fashion, consumer goods, cars, food, and retail. Results show full fine-tuning consistently performs well, while text-image and self-supervised embeddings can match its performance with less training. While supervised embeddings remain stable across architectures, SSL and contrastive embeddings vary significantly, often benefiting from top-tuning. Top-tuning emerges as an efficient alternative to full fine-tuning, reducing computational costs. We also explore cross-tuning, noting its impact depends on dataset characteristics. Our findings offer practical guidelines for embedding selection and fine-tuning strategies, balancing efficiency and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at Future Technologies Conference (FTC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[GPT Carry-On: Training Foundation Model for Customization Could Be Simple, Scalable and Affordable](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07513v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern large language foundation models (LLM) have now entered the daily lives of millions of users. We ask a natural question whether it is possible to customize LLM for every user or every task. From system and industrial economy consideration, general continue-training or fine-tuning still require substantial computation and memory of training GPU nodes, whereas most inference nodes under deployment, possibly with lower-end GPUs, are configured to make forward pass fastest possible. We propose a framework to take full advantages of existing LLMs and systems of online service. We train an additional branch of transformer blocks on the final-layer embedding of pretrained LLMs, which is the base, then a carry-on module merge the base models to compose a customized LLM. We can mix multiple layers, or multiple LLMs specialized in different domains such as chat, coding, math, to form a new mixture of LLM that best fit a new task. As the base model don't need to update parameters, we are able to outsource most computation of the training job on inference nodes, and only train a lightweight carry-on on training nodes, where we consume less than 1GB GPU memory to train a 100M carry-on layer on 30B LLM. We tested Qwen and DeepSeek opensourced models for continue-pretraining and got faster loss convergence. We use it to improve solving math questions with extremely small computation and model size, with 1000 data samples of chain-of-thoughts, and as small as 1 MB parameters of two layer layer carry-on, and the results are promising.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resource-efficient Inference with Foundation Model Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07247v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inference-time resource costs of large language and vision models present a growing challenge in production deployments. We propose the use of foundation model programs, i.e., programs that can invoke foundation models with varying resource costs and performance, as an approach to this problem. Specifically, we present a method that translates a task into a program, then learns a policy for resource allocation that, on each input, selects foundation model "backends" for each program module. The policy uses smaller, cheaper backends to handle simpler subtasks, while allowing more complex subtasks to leverage larger, more capable models. We evaluate the method on two new "streaming" visual question-answering tasks in which a system answers a question on a sequence of inputs, receiving ground-truth feedback after each answer. Compared to monolithic multi-modal models, our implementation achieves up to 98% resource savings with minimal accuracy loss, demonstrating its potential for scalable and resource-efficient multi-modal inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching pathology foundation models to accurately predict gene expression with parameter efficient knowledge transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07061v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gene expression profiling provides critical insights into cellular heterogeneity, biological processes and disease mechanisms. There has been an increasing interest in computational approaches that can predict gene expression directly from digitalized histopathology images. While image foundation models have shown promise in a variety of pathology downstream analysis, their performances on gene-expression prediction are still limited. Explicitly incorporating information from the transcriptomic models can help image models to address domain shift, yet the fine-tuning and alignment of foundation models can be expensive. In the work, we propose Parameter Efficient Knowledge trAnsfer (PEKA), a novel framework that leverages Block-Affine Adaptation and integrates knowledge distillation and structure alignment losses for cross-modal knowledge transfer. We evaluated PEKA for gene expression prediction using multiple spatial transcriptomics datasets (comprising 206,123 image tiles with matched gene expression profiles) that encompassed various types of tissue. PEKA achieved at least 5\% performance improvement over baseline foundation models while also outperforming alternative parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies. We will release the code, datasets and aligned models after peer-review to facilitate broader adoption and further development for parameter efficient model alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Can Be a Foundation for Hidden Rationale-Based Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16615v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent advancement in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, most retrieval methodologies are often developed for factual retrieval, which assumes query and positive documents are semantically similar. In this paper, we instead propose and study a more challenging type of retrieval task, called hidden rationale retrieval, in which query and document are not similar but can be inferred by reasoning chains, logic relationships, or empirical experiences. To address such problems, an instruction-tuned Large language model (LLM) with a cross-encoder architecture could be a reasonable choice. To further strengthen pioneering LLM-based retrievers, we design a special instruction that transforms the retrieval task into a generative task by prompting LLM to answer a binary-choice question. The model can be fine-tuned with direct preference optimization (DPO). The framework is also optimized for computational efficiency with no performance degradation. We name this retrieval framework by RaHoRe and verify its zero-shot and fine-tuned performance superiority on Emotional Support Conversation (ESC), compared with previous retrieval works. Our study suggests the potential to employ LLM as a foundation for a wider scope of retrieval tasks. Our codes, models, and datasets are available on https://github.com/flyfree5/LaHoRe.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, ECIR 2025</p></details> |

However, a significant challenge lies in the scarcity and high cost of obtaining high-quality materials datasets. While foundation models pre-trained on large datasets have excelled in fields like natural language processing by leveraging latent features through transfer learning, their application in materials science remains limited. Here, we present a foundation model specifically designed for composite materials. Pre-trained on a dataset of short-fiber composites to learn robust latent features, the model accurately predicts homogenized stiffness during transfer learning, even with limited training data. Additionally, our model effectively predicts the material's nonlinear behavior by transferring these learned features to an Interaction-based Material Network, which is a constitutive surrogate model. These results demonstrate the potential of our foundation model to capture complex material behaviors. Our findings validate the feasibility and effectiveness of foundation models in composite materials. We anticipate extending this approach to more complex three-dimensional composite materials, polycrystalline materials, and beyond. Moreover, this framework enables high-accuracy predictions even when experimental data are scarce, paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective materials design and analysis.</p></details> |  |

Graph neural networks excel at learning graph data, the omnipresent non-Euclidean structure, but often lack the generalization capacity. Hence, graph foundation model is drawing increasing attention, and recent efforts have been made to leverage Large Language Models. On the one hand, existing studies primarily focus on text-attributed graphs, while a wider range of real graphs do not contain fruitful textual attributes. On the other hand, the sequential graph description tailored for the Large Language Model neglects the structural complexity, which is a predominant characteristic of the graph. Such limitations motivate an important question: Can we go beyond Large Language Models, and pretrain a universal model to learn the structural knowledge for any graph? The answer in the language or vision domain is a shared vocabulary. We observe the fact that there also exist shared substructures underlying graph domain, and thereby open a new opportunity of graph foundation model with structural vocabulary. The key innovation is the discovery of a simple yet effective structural vocabulary of trees and cycles, and we explore its inherent connection to Riemannian geometry. Herein, we present a universal pretraining model, RiemannGFM. Concretely, we first construct a novel product bundle to incorporate the diverse geometries of the vocabulary. Then, on this constructed space, we stack Riemannian layers where the structural vocabulary, regardless of specific graph, is learned in Riemannian manifold offering cross-domain transferability. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of RiemannGFM on a diversity of real graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

However, their high-dimensional output features often create a mismatch with downstream task models, which typically require lower-dimensional inputs. A common solution is to apply a dimensionality reduction (DR) layer, but this approach increases parameter overhead, computational costs, and risks losing valuable information. To address these issues, we propose Nested Res2Net (Nes2Net), a lightweight back-end architecture designed to directly process high-dimensional features without DR layers. The nested structure enhances multi-scale feature extraction, improves feature interaction, and preserves high-dimensional information. We first validate Nes2Net on CtrSVDD, a singing voice deepfake detection dataset, and report a 22% performance improvement and an 87% back-end computational cost reduction over the state-of-the-art baseline. Additionally, extensive testing across four diverse datasets: ASVspoof 2021, ASVspoof 5, PartialSpoof, and In-the-Wild, covering fully spoofed speech, adversarial attacks, partial spoofing, and real-world scenarios, consistently highlights Nes2Net's superior robustness and generalization capabilities.

Here, we present a systematic evaluation of transfer learning strategies for brain tumor classification using these models. We analyzed 254 cases comprising five major tumor types: glioblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and metastatic tumors. Comparing state-of-the-art foundation models with conventional approaches, we found that foundation models demonstrated robust classification performance with as few as 10 patches per case, despite the traditional assumption that extensive per-case image sampling is necessary. Furthermore, our evaluation revealed that simple transfer learning strategies like linear probing were sufficient, while fine-tuning often degraded model performance. These findings suggest a paradigm shift from "training encoders on extensive pathological data" to "querying pre-trained encoders with labeled datasets", providing practical implications for implementing AI-assisted diagnosis in clinical pathology.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |

Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies demonstrate that increasing the training data set and model size and integrating domain-specific image processing techniques can significantly enhance the model's performance on downstream tasks. Building on these insights, our work incorporates several recent modifications to the standard DINOv2 framework from the literature to optimize the training of pathology FMs. We also apply a post-training procedure for fine-tuning models on higher-resolution images to further enrich the information encoded in the embeddings. We present three novel pathology FMs trained on up to two orders of magnitude fewer WSIs than those used to train other state-of-the-art FMs while demonstrating a comparable or superior performance on downstream tasks. Even the model trained on TCGA alone (12k WSIs) outperforms most existing FMs and, on average, matches Virchow2, the second-best FM published to date. This suggests that there still remains a significant potential for further improving the models and algorithms used to train pathology FMs to take full advantage of the vast data collections.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Their applications in the software engineering of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are also growing. However, research in this area remains limited. Moreover, existing studies have primarily focused on LLMs-only one type of FM-leaving ample opportunities to explore others, such as vision-language models. We argue that, in addition to LLMs, other FMs utilizing different data modalities (e.g., images, audio) and multimodal models (which integrate multiple modalities) hold great potential for supporting CPS software engineering, given that these systems process diverse data types. To address this, we present a research roadmap for integrating FMs into various phases of CPS software engineering, highlighting key research opportunities and challenges for the software engineering community.</p></details> | 1 figure, 11 pages |

Through rigorous few-shot training, we found that the integration of image-based data augmentation techniques and grid-based sub-domain search strategy significantly enhances the performance of these foundation models. Building upon GroundingDINO, we employed several widely used image augmentation methods and established optimization objectives to effectively navigate the expansive domain space in search of optimal sub-domains. This approach facilitates efficient few-shot object detection and introduces an approach to solving the CD-FSOD problem by efficiently searching for the optimal parameter configuration from the foundation model. Our findings substantially advance the practical deployment of vision-language models in data-scarce environments, offering critical insights into optimizing their cross-domain generalization capabilities without labor-intensive retraining.

We make the first attempt and propose a self-supervised pretraining framework to learn fundamental representations of real face images, FSFM, that leverages the synergy between masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID). We explore various facial masking strategies for MIM and present a simple yet powerful CRFR-P masking, which explicitly forces the model to capture meaningful intra-region consistency and challenging inter-region coherency. Furthermore, we devise the ID network that naturally couples with MIM to establish underlying local-to-global correspondence via tailored self-distillation. These three learning objectives, namely 3C, empower encoding both local features and global semantics of real faces. After pretraining, a vanilla ViT serves as a universal vision foundation model for downstream face security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forgery detection.

Recent research challenges this common paradigm by introducing data-effective learning approaches, demonstrating that merely increasing pre-training data volume does not necessarily improve model performance. However, current methods still have unclear standards and the underlying theoretical foundation remains unknown. In this paper, as the first attempt to address this limitation, we introduce V-information into self-supervised pre-training of foundation models to provide a theoretical foundation for sample selection. Our derivation confirms that by optimizing V-information, sample selection can be framed as an optimization problem where choosing diverse and challenging samples enhances model performance even under limited training data. Under this guidance, we develop an optimized data-effective learning method (OptiDEL) to optimize V-information in real-world medical domains by generating more diverse and harder samples. We compare the OptiDEL method with state-of-the-art approaches finding that OptiDEL consistently outperforms existing approaches across eight different datasets, with foundation models trained on only 5% of the pre-training data achieving up to 6.2% higher mIoU than those trained on the full dataset. Remarkably, OptiDEL demonstrates an average improvement of 4.7% mIoU over competing methods while using 20x less training data.</p></details> |  |

Recent Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs), pretrained on large-scale histopathology data, have significantly enhanced capabilities of extractors and aggregators but lack systematic analysis frameworks. This survey presents a hierarchical taxonomy organizing PFMs through a top-down philosophy that can be utilized to analyze FMs in any domain: model scope, model pretraining, and model design. Additionally, we systematically categorize PFM evaluation tasks into slide-level, patch-level, multimodal, and biological tasks, providing comprehensive benchmarking criteria. Our analysis identifies critical challenges in both PFM development (pathology-specific methodology, end-to-end pretraining, data-model scalability) and utilization (effective adaptation, model maintenance), paving the way for future directions in this promising field.

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art pre-trained foundation models, introducing a novel taxonomy to categorize them across several dimensions. Specifically, we classify models by their architecture design, distinguishing between those leveraging patch-based representations and those operating directly on raw sequences. The taxonomy further includes whether the models provide probabilistic or deterministic predictions, and whether they are designed to work with univariate time series or can handle multivariate time series out of the box. Additionally, the taxonomy encompasses model scale and complexity, highlighting differences between lightweight architectures and large-scale foundation models. A unique aspect of this survey is its categorization by the type of objective function employed during training phase. By synthesizing these perspectives, this survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners, providing insights into current trends and identifying promising directions for future research in transformer-based time series modeling.</p></details> |  |

| **[Developing Generalist Foundation Models from a Multimodal Dataset for 3D Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17834v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While computer vision has achieved tremendous success with multimodal encoding and direct textual interaction with images via chat-based large language models, similar advancements in medical imaging AI, particularly in 3D imaging, have been limited due to the scarcity of comprehensive datasets. To address this critical gap, we introduce CT-RATE, the first dataset that pairs 3D medical images with corresponding textual reports. CT-RATE comprises 25,692 non-contrast 3D chest CT scans from 21,304 unique patients. Through various reconstructions, these scans are expanded to 50,188 volumes, totaling over 14.3 million 2D slices. Each scan is accompanied by its corresponding radiology report. Leveraging CT-RATE, we develop CT-CLIP, a CT-focused contrastive language-image pretraining framework designed for broad applications without the need for task-specific training. We demonstrate how CT-CLIP can be used in two tasks: multi-abnormality detection and case retrieval. Remarkably, in multi-abnormality detection, CT-CLIP outperforms state-of-the-art fully supervised models across all key metrics, effectively eliminating the need for manual annotation. In case retrieval, it efficiently retrieves relevant cases using either image or textual queries, thereby enhancing knowledge dissemination. By combining CT-CLIP's vision encoder with a pretrained large language model, we create CT-CHAT, a vision-language foundational chat model for 3D chest CT volumes. Finetuned on over 2.7 million question-answer pairs derived from the CT-RATE dataset, CT-CHAT surpasses other multimodal AI assistants, underscoring the necessity for specialized methods in 3D medical imaging. Collectively, the open-source release of CT-RATE, CT-CLIP, and CT-CHAT not only addresses critical challenges in 3D medical imaging, but also lays the groundwork for future innovations in medical AI and improved patient care.</p></details> |  |

They play a crucial role in understanding the psychological basis of human behavior and cultural orientation. The Moral Foundation Theory (MFT) is a well-established framework that identifies the core moral foundations underlying the manner in which different cultures shape individual and social lives. Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), have enabled the extraction and analysis of moral dimensions from textual data. This survey presents a comprehensive review of MFT-informed PLMs, providing an analysis of moral tendencies in PLMs and their application in the context of the MFT. We also review relevant datasets and lexicons and discuss trends, limitations, and future directions.

| **[Benchmarking Vision Foundation Models for Input Monitoring in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08083v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain challenged by distribution shifts in complex open-world domains like automated driving (AD): Robustness against yet unknown novel objects (semantic shift) or styles like lighting conditions (covariate shift) cannot be guaranteed. Hence, reliable operation-time monitors for identification of out-of-training-data-distribution (OOD) scenarios are imperative. Current approaches for OOD classification are untested for complex domains like AD, are limited in the kinds of shifts they detect, or even require supervision with OOD samples. To prepare for unanticipated shifts, we instead establish a framework around a principled, unsupervised and model-agnostic method that unifies detection of semantic and covariate shifts: Find a full model of the training data's feature distribution, to then use its density at new points as in-distribution (ID) score. To implement this, we propose to combine Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as feature extractors with density modeling techniques. Through a comprehensive benchmark of 4 VFMs with different backbone architectures and 5 density-modeling techniques against established baselines, we provide the first systematic evaluation of OOD classification capabilities of VFMs across diverse conditions. A comparison with state-of-the-art binary OOD classification methods reveals that VFM embeddings with density estimation outperform existing approaches in identifying OOD inputs. Additionally, we show that our method detects high-risk inputs likely to cause errors in downstream tasks, thereby improving overall performance. Overall, VFMs, when coupled with robust density modeling techniques, are promising to realize model-agnostic, unsupervised, reliable safety monitors in complex vision tasks</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpreting Object-level Foundation Models via Visual Precision Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16198v4)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in multimodal pre-training have propelled object-level foundation models, such as Grounding DINO and Florence-2, in tasks like visual grounding and object detection. However, interpreting these models' decisions has grown increasingly challenging. Existing interpretable attribution methods for object-level task interpretation have notable limitations: (1) gradient-based methods lack precise localization due to visual-textual fusion in foundation models, and (2) perturbation-based methods produce noisy saliency maps, limiting fine-grained interpretability. To address these, we propose a Visual Precision Search method that generates accurate attribution maps with fewer regions. Our method bypasses internal model parameters to overcome attribution issues from multimodal fusion, dividing inputs into sparse sub-regions and using consistency and collaboration scores to accurately identify critical decision-making regions. We also conducted a theoretical analysis of the boundary guarantees and scope of applicability of our method. Experiments on RefCOCO, MS COCO, and LVIS show our approach enhances object-level task interpretability over SOTA for Grounding DINO and Florence-2 across various evaluation metrics, with faithfulness gains of 23.7%, 31.6%, and 20.1% on MS COCO, LVIS, and RefCOCO for Grounding DINO, and 102.9% and 66.9% on MS COCO and RefCOCO for Florence-2. Additionally, our method can interpret failures in visual grounding and object detection tasks, surpassing existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

However, their application in remote sensing (RS) remains constrained by a fundamental gap: existing models predominantly handle single or limited modalities, overlooking the inherently multi-modal nature of RS observations. Optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and multi-spectral data offer complementary insights that significantly reduce the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty in single-source analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce RingMoE, a unified multi-modal RS foundation model with 14.7 billion parameters, pre-trained on 400 million multi-modal RS images from nine satellites. RingMoE incorporates three key innovations: (1) A hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture comprising modal-specialized, collaborative, and shared experts, effectively modeling intra-modal knowledge while capturing cross-modal dependencies to mitigate conflicts between modal representations; (2) Physics-informed self-supervised learning, explicitly embedding sensor-specific radiometric characteristics into the pre-training objectives; (3) Dynamic expert pruning, enabling adaptive model compression from 14.7B to 1B parameters while maintaining performance, facilitating efficient deployment in Earth observation applications. Evaluated across 23 benchmarks spanning six key RS tasks (i.e., classification, detection, segmentation, tracking, change detection, and depth estimation), RingMoE outperforms existing foundation models and sets new SOTAs, demonstrating remarkable adaptability from single-modal to multi-modal scenarios. Beyond theoretical progress, it has been deployed and trialed in multiple sectors, including emergency response, land management, marine sciences, and urban planning.</p></details> |  |

| **[F-ViTA: Foundation Model Guided Visible to Thermal Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02801v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thermal imaging is crucial for scene understanding, particularly in low-light and nighttime conditions. However, collecting large thermal datasets is costly and labor-intensive due to the specialized equipment required for infrared image capture. To address this challenge, researchers have explored visible-to-thermal image translation. Most existing methods rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Diffusion Models (DMs), treating the task as a style transfer problem. As a result, these approaches attempt to learn both the modality distribution shift and underlying physical principles from limited training data. In this paper, we propose F-ViTA, a novel approach that leverages the general world knowledge embedded in foundation models to guide the diffusion process for improved translation. Specifically, we condition an InstructPix2Pix Diffusion Model with zero-shot masks and labels from foundation models such as SAM and Grounded DINO. This allows the model to learn meaningful correlations between scene objects and their thermal signatures in infrared imagery. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that F-ViTA outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Furthermore, our model generalizes well to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and can generate Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR), Mid-Wave Infrared (MWIR), and Near-Infrared (NIR) translations from the same visible image.

| **[The Foundations of Tokenization: Statistical and Computational Concerns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11606v4)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tokenization - the practice of converting strings of characters from an alphabet into sequences of tokens over a vocabulary - is a critical step in the NLP pipeline. The use of token representations is widely credited with increased model performance but is also the source of many undesirable behaviors, such as spurious ambiguity or inconsistency. Despite its recognized importance as a standard representation method in NLP, the theoretical underpinnings of tokenization are not yet fully understood. In particular, the impact of tokenization on language model estimation has been investigated primarily through empirical means. The present paper contributes to addressing this theoretical gap by proposing a unified formal framework for representing and analyzing tokenizer models. Based on the category of stochastic maps, this framework enables us to establish general conditions for a principled use of tokenizers and, most importantly, the necessary and sufficient conditions for a tokenizer model to preserve the consistency of statistical estimators. In addition, we discuss statistical and computational concerns crucial for designing and implementing tokenizer models, such as inconsistency, ambiguity, finiteness, and sequentiality. The framework and results advanced in this paper contribute to building robust theoretical foundations for representations in neural language modeling that can inform future theoretical and empirical research.</p></details> |  |

For pixel-wise regression tasks, specifically utilizing remote sensing data from satellite imagery in EO Foundation Models, confidence quantification is a critical challenge. The focus of this research work is on developing a Foundation Model using EO satellite data that computes and assigns a confidence metric alongside regression outputs to improve the reliability and interpretability of predictions generated by deep neural networks. To this end, we develop, train and evaluate the proposed Confidence-Aware Regression Estimation (CARE) Foundation Model. Our model CARE computes and assigns confidence to regression results as downstream tasks of a Foundation Model for EO data, and performs a confidence-aware self-corrective learning method for the low-confidence regions. We evaluate the model CARE, and experimental results on multi-spectral data from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite constellation to estimate the building density (i.e. monitoring urban growth), show that the proposed method can be successfully applied to important regression problems in EO and remote sensing. We also show that our model CARE outperforms other baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, Submitted</p></details> |

Recently, foundation models have played a remarkable role in advancing medical AI. The development of an ECG foundation model holds the promise of elevating AI-ECG research to new heights. However, building such a model faces several challenges, including insufficient database sample sizes and inadequate generalization across multiple domains. Additionally, there is a notable performance gap between single-lead and multi-lead ECG analyses. We introduced an ECG Foundation Model (ECGFounder), a general-purpose model that leverages real-world ECG annotations from cardiology experts to broaden the diagnostic capabilities of ECG analysis. ECGFounder was trained on over 10 million ECGs with 150 label categories from the Harvard-Emory ECG Database, enabling comprehensive cardiovascular disease diagnosis through ECG analysis. The model is designed to be both an effective out-of-the-box solution, and a to be fine-tunable for downstream tasks, maximizing usability. Importantly, we extended its application to lower rank ECGs, and arbitrary single-lead ECGs in particular. ECGFounder is applicable to supporting various downstream tasks in mobile monitoring scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ECGFounder achieves expert-level performance on internal validation sets, with AUROC exceeding 0.95 for eighty diagnoses. It also shows strong classification performance and generalization across various diagnoses on external validation sets. When fine-tuned, ECGFounder outperforms baseline models in demographic analysis, clinical event detection, and cross-modality cardiac rhythm diagnosis. The trained model and data will be publicly released upon publication through the bdsp.io.

| **[Mixtera: A Data Plane for Foundation Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19790v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art large language and vision models are trained over trillions of tokens that are aggregated from a large variety of sources. As training data collections grow, manually managing the samples becomes time-consuming, tedious, and prone to errors. Yet recent research shows that the data mixture and the order in which samples are visited during training can significantly influence model accuracy. We build and present Mixtera, a data plane for foundation model training that enables users to declaratively express which data samples should be used in which proportion and in which order during training. Mixtera is a centralized, read-only layer that is deployed on top of existing training data collections and can be declaratively queried. It operates independently of the filesystem structure and supports mixtures across arbitrary properties (e.g., language, source dataset) as well as dynamic adjustment of the mixture based on model feedback. We experimentally evaluate Mixtera and show that our implementation does not bottleneck training and scales to 256 GH200 superchips. We demonstrate how Mixtera supports recent advancements in mixing strategies by implementing the proposed Adaptive Data Optimization (ADO) algorithm in the system and evaluating its performance impact. We also explore the role of mixtures for vision-language models.</p></details> | under submission |

Real-world challenges like occlusion and non-texture hinder accurate disparity estimation from binocular matching cues. Recently, monocular relative depth estimation has shown remarkable generalization using vision foundation models. Thus, to facilitate robust stereo matching with monocular depth cues, we incorporate a robust monocular relative depth model into the recurrent stereo-matching framework, building a new framework for depth foundation model-based stereo-matching, DEFOM-Stereo. In the feature extraction stage, we construct the combined context and matching feature encoder by integrating features from conventional CNNs and DEFOM. In the update stage, we use the depth predicted by DEFOM to initialize the recurrent disparity and introduce a scale update module to refine the disparity at the correct scale. DEFOM-Stereo is verified to have much stronger zero-shot generalization compared with SOTA methods. Moreover, DEFOM-Stereo achieves top performance on the KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, Middlebury, and ETH3D benchmarks, ranking $1^{st}$ on many metrics. In the joint evaluation under the robust vision challenge, our model simultaneously outperforms previous models on the individual benchmarks, further demonstrating its outstanding capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/Insta360-Research-Team/DEFOM-Stereo</p></details> |

Many existing deep-learning-based methods for analyzing colonoscopic videos either require task-specific fine-tuning, lack tracking capabilities, or rely on domain-specific pre-training. In this paper, we introduce PolypSegTrack, a novel foundation model that jointly addresses polyp detection, segmentation, classification and unsupervised tracking in colonoscopic videos. Our approach leverages a novel conditional mask loss, enabling flexible training across datasets with either pixel-level segmentation masks or bounding box annotations, allowing us to bypass task-specific fine-tuning. Our unsupervised tracking module reliably associates polyp instances across frames using object queries, without relying on any heuristics. We leverage a robust vision foundation model backbone that is pre-trained unsupervisedly on natural images, thereby removing the need for domain-specific pre-training. Extensive experiments on multiple polyp benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in detection, segmentation, classification, and tracking.</p></details> |  |

Social science has a long history of studying the social impacts of transformative technologies in terms of pre-existing systems of power and how these systems are disrupted or reinforced by new technologies. In this position paper, we build on prior work studying the social impacts of earlier technologies to propose a conceptual framework studying foundation models as sociotechnical systems, incorporating social science expertise to better understand how these models affect systems of power, anticipate the impacts of deploying these models in various applications, and study the effectiveness of technical interventions intended to mitigate social harms. We advocate for an interdisciplinary and collaborative research paradigm between AI and social science across all stages of foundation model research and development to promote socially responsible research practices and use cases, and outline several strategies to facilitate such research.</p></details> |  |

In addition, saved checkpoints are dispatched to evaluation tasks or transferred across different training stages (e.g., from pre-training to post-training). All these scenarios require resharding distributed checkpoints from one parallelism to another. In production environments, different LFMs are trained with various frameworks and storage backends, depending on model sizes and training scales. A high-performance checkpointing system is needed to enable efficient checkpoint management at scale throughout the lifecycle of LFM development. We introduce ByteCheckpoint, an industrial-grade checkpointing system for large-scale LFM training. ByteCheckpoint features: a parallelism-agnostic checkpoint representation that enables efficient load-time checkpoint resharding; a generic checkpoint saving/loading workflow to accommodate multiple training frameworks and support different storage backends; full-stack optimizations to ensure high I/O efficiency and scalability; a suite of monitoring tools to streamline large-scale performance analysis and bottleneck detection. Compared to existing open-source checkpointing systems [52, 58], ByteCheckpoint significantly reduces runtime checkpoint stalls, achieving an average reduction of 54.20x. For saving and loading times, ByteCheckpoint achieves improvements of up to 9.96x and 8.80x, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniFault: A Fault Diagnosis Foundation Model from Bearing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01373v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine fault diagnosis (FD) is a critical task for predictive maintenance, enabling early fault detection and preventing unexpected failures. Despite its importance, existing FD models are operation-specific with limited generalization across diverse datasets. Foundation models (FM) have demonstrated remarkable potential in both visual and language domains, achieving impressive generalization capabilities even with minimal data through few-shot or zero-shot learning. However, translating these advances to FD presents unique hurdles. Unlike the large-scale, cohesive datasets available for images and text, FD datasets are typically smaller and more heterogeneous, with significant variations in sampling frequencies and the number of channels across different systems and applications. This heterogeneity complicates the design of a universal architecture capable of effectively processing such diverse data while maintaining robust feature extraction and learning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce UniFault, a foundation model for fault diagnosis that systematically addresses these issues. Specifically, the model incorporates a comprehensive data harmonization pipeline featuring two key innovations. First, a unification scheme transforms multivariate inputs into standardized univariate sequences while retaining local inter-channel relationships. Second, a novel cross-domain temporal fusion strategy mitigates distribution shifts and enriches sample diversity and count, improving the model generalization across varying conditions. UniFault is pretrained on over 9 billion data points spanning diverse FD datasets, enabling superior few-shot performance. Extensive experiments on real-world FD datasets demonstrate that UniFault achieves SoTA performance, setting a new benchmark for fault diagnosis models and paving the way for more scalable and robust predictive maintenance solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundations and Evaluations in NLP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01342v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This memoir explores two fundamental aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP): the creation of linguistic resources and the evaluation of NLP system performance. Over the past decade, my work has focused on developing a morpheme-based annotation scheme for the Korean language that captures linguistic properties from morphology to semantics. This approach has achieved state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks, including part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition. Additionally, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of segmentation granularity and its critical impact on NLP system performance. In parallel with linguistic resource development, I have proposed a novel evaluation framework, the jp-algorithm, which introduces an alignment-based method to address challenges in preprocessing tasks like tokenization and sentence boundary detection (SBD). Traditional evaluation methods assume identical tokenization and sentence lengths between gold standards and system outputs, limiting their applicability to real-world data. The jp-algorithm overcomes these limitations, enabling robust end-to-end evaluations across a variety of NLP tasks. It enhances accuracy and flexibility by incorporating linear-time alignment while preserving the complexity of traditional evaluation metrics. This memoir provides key insights into the processing of morphologically rich languages, such as Korean, while offering a generalizable framework for evaluating diverse end-to-end NLP systems. My contributions lay the foundation for future developments, with broader implications for multilingual resource development and system evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-time Adaptation for Foundation Medical Segmentation Model without Parametric Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02008v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation medical segmentation models, with MedSAM being the most popular, have achieved promising performance across organs and lesions. However, MedSAM still suffers from compromised performance on specific lesions with intricate structures and appearance, as well as bounding box prompt-induced perturbations. Although current test-time adaptation (TTA) methods for medical image segmentation may tackle this issue, partial (e.g., batch normalization) or whole parametric updates restrict their effectiveness due to limited update signals or catastrophic forgetting in large models. Meanwhile, these approaches ignore the computational complexity during adaptation, which is particularly significant for modern foundation models. To this end, our theoretical analyses reveal that directly refining image embeddings is feasible to approach the same goal as parametric updates under the MedSAM architecture, which enables us to realize high computational efficiency and segmentation performance without the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Under this framework, we propose to encourage maximizing factorized conditional probabilities of the posterior prediction probability using a proposed distribution-approximated latent conditional random field loss combined with an entropy minimization loss. Experiments show that we achieve about 3\% Dice score improvements across three datasets while reducing computational complexity by over 7 times.</p></details> | Under review |

However, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for forecasting enables the adaptation to specific domains but may not generalize well across diverse, unseen datasets. Meanwhile, existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) lack inherent mechanisms for domain adaptation and suffer from limited interpretability, making them suboptimal for zero-shot forecasting. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation based time series forecasting framework that enhances the generalization capability and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant time series segments from a dedicated knowledge database, incorporating contextual patterns for the given time series query. Next, we develop a learnable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based augmentation module, which dynamically fuses retrieved time series patterns with the TSFM's representation of the input query, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming TSFMs by up to 6.51% across diverse domains and showcasing desired interpretability.</p></details> |  |

CoACT consists of three key components:(i) asynchronous contrastive tuning, which learns new classes by including LoRA modules in the pre-trained encoder while enforcing consistency between two asynchronous encoders; (ii) controlled fine-tuning, which facilitates effective tuning of a subset of the foundation model; and (iii) consistency-guided incremental tuning, which enforces additional regularization during later sessions to reduce forgetting of the learned classes. We evaluate our proposed solution on Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) as well as a new and more challenging setup called Few-Shot Class-Incremental Tuning (FSCIT), which facilitates the continual tuning of vision foundation models to learn new classes with only a few samples per class. Unlike traditional FSCIL, FSCIT does not require a large in-distribution base session for initial fully supervised training prior to the incremental few-shot sessions. We conduct extensive evaluations across 16 diverse datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of CoACT in both FSCIL and FSCIT setups. CoACT outperforms existing methods by up to 5.02% in FSCIL and up to 12.51% in FSCIT for individual datasets, with an average improvement of 2.47%. Furthermore, CoACT exhibits reduced forgetting and enhanced robustness in low-shot experiments. Detailed ablation and sensitivity studies highlight the contribution of each component of CoACT.

To address these challenges, we present HyperSIGMA, a vision transformer-based foundation model that unifies HSI interpretation across tasks and scenes, scalable to over one billion parameters. To overcome the spectral and spatial redundancy inherent in HSIs, we introduce a novel sparse sampling attention (SSA) mechanism, which effectively promotes the learning of diverse contextual features and serves as the basic block of HyperSIGMA. HyperSIGMA integrates spatial and spectral features using a specially designed spectral enhancement module. In addition, we construct a large-scale hyperspectral dataset, HyperGlobal-450K, for pre-training, which contains about 450K hyperspectral images, significantly surpassing existing datasets in scale. Extensive experiments on various high-level and low-level HSI tasks demonstrate HyperSIGMA's versatility and superior representational capability compared to current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, HyperSIGMA shows significant advantages in scalability, robustness, cross-modal transferring capability, real-world applicability, and computational efficiency. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/WHU-Sigma/HyperSIGMA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TPAMI.

| **[CellVTA: Enhancing Vision Foundation Models for Accurate Cell Segmentation and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00784v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell instance segmentation is a fundamental task in digital pathology with broad clinical applications. Recently, vision foundation models, which are predominantly based on Vision Transformers (ViTs), have achieved remarkable success in pathology image analysis. However, their improvements in cell instance segmentation remain limited. A key challenge arises from the tokenization process in ViTs, which substantially reduces the spatial resolution of input images, leading to suboptimal segmentation quality, especially for small and densely packed cells. To address this problem, we propose CellVTA (Cell Vision Transformer with Adapter), a novel method that improves the performance of vision foundation models for cell instance segmentation by incorporating a CNN-based adapter module. This adapter extracts high-resolution spatial information from input images and injects it into the ViT through a cross-attention mechanism. Our method preserves the core architecture of ViT, ensuring seamless integration with pretrained foundation models. Extensive experiments show that CellVTA achieves 0.538 mPQ on the CoNIC dataset and 0.506 mPQ on the PanNuke dataset, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art cell segmentation methods. Ablation studies confirm the superiority of our approach over other fine-tuning strategies, including decoder-only fine-tuning and full fine-tuning. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/JieZheng-ShanghaiTech/CellVTA.</p></details> |  |
