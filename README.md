| **[Efficient Deep Demosaicing with Spatially Downsampled Isotropic Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00703v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In digital imaging, image demosaicing is a crucial first step which recovers the RGB information from a color filter array (CFA). Oftentimes, deep learning is utilized to perform image demosaicing. Given that most modern digital imaging applications occur on mobile platforms, applying deep learning to demosaicing requires lightweight and efficient networks. Isotropic networks, also known as residual-in-residual networks, have been often employed for image demosaicing and joint-demosaicing-and-denoising (JDD). Most demosaicing isotropic networks avoid spatial downsampling entirely, and thus are often prohibitively expensive computationally for mobile applications. Contrary to previous isotropic network designs, this paper claims that spatial downsampling to a signficant degree can improve the efficiency and performance of isotropic networks. To validate this claim, we design simple fully convolutional networks with and without downsampling using a mathematical architecture design technique adapted from DeepMAD, and find that downsampling improves empirical performance. Additionally, empirical testing of the downsampled variant, JD3Net, of our fully convolutional networks reveals strong empirical performance on a variety of image demosaicing and JDD tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures.

| **[CubeBench: Diagnosing Interactive, Long-Horizon Spatial Reasoning Under Partial Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23328v3)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents, while proficient in the digital realm, face a significant gap in physical-world deployment due to the challenge of forming and maintaining a robust spatial mental model. We identify three core cognitive challenges hindering this transition: spatial reasoning, long-horizon state tracking via mental simulation, and active exploration under partial observation. To isolate and evaluate these faculties, we introduce CubeBench, a novel generative benchmark centered on the Rubik's Cube. CubeBench uses a three-tiered diagnostic framework that progressively assesses agent capabilities, from foundational state tracking with full symbolic information to active exploration with only partial visual data. Our experiments on leading LLMs reveal critical limitations, including a uniform 0.00% pass rate on all long-horizon tasks, exposing a fundamental failure in long-term planning. We also propose a diagnostic framework to isolate these cognitive bottlenecks by providing external solver tools. By analyzing the failure modes, we provide key insights to guide the development of more physically-grounded intelligent agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Webpa...</summary><p>Webpage: https://cubebench.c7w.tech/</p></details> |
| **[Spatially-Grounded Document Retrieval via Patch-to-Region Relevance Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02660v3)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Late-interaction multimodal retrieval models like ColPali achieve state-of-the-art document retrieval by embedding pages as images and computing fine-grained similarity between query tokens and visual patches. However, they operate at page-level granularity, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on area efficiency. We evaluate on BBox-DocVQA with ground-truth bounding boxes. For within-page localization (given correct page retrieval), ColQwen3-4B with percentile-50 thresholding achieves 59.7% hit rate at IoU@0.5 (84.4% at IoU@0.25, 35.8% at IoU@0.7), with mean IoU of 0.569, compared to ~6.7% for random region selection. Our approach reduces context tokens by 28.8% compared to returning all OCR regions and by 52.3% compared to full-page image tokens. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training. We release Snappy, an open-source implementation at https://github.com/athrael-soju/Snappy.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables.

| **[A Spatially Masked Adaptive Gated Network for multimodal post-flood water extent mapping using SAR and incomplete multispectral data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00123v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mapping water extent during a flood event is essential for effective disaster management throughout all phases: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. In particular, during the response stage, when timely and accurate information is important, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are primarily employed to produce water extent maps. Recently, leveraging the complementary characteristics of SAR and MSI data through a multimodal approach has emerged as a promising strategy for advancing water extent mapping using deep learning models. This approach is particularly beneficial when timely post-flood observations, acquired during or shortly after the flood peak, are limited, as it enables the use of all available imagery for more accurate post-flood water extent mapping. However, the adaptive integration of partially available MSI data into the SAR-based post-flood water extent mapping process remains underexplored. To bridge this research gap, we propose the Spatially Masked Adaptive Gated Network (SMAGNet), a multimodal deep learning model that utilizes SAR data as the primary input for post-flood water extent mapping and integrates complementary MSI data through feature fusion. In experiments on the C2S-MS Floods dataset, SMAGNet consistently outperformed other multimodal deep learning models in prediction performance across varying levels of MSI data availability. Furthermore, we found that even when MSI data were completely missing, the performance of SMAGNet remained statistically comparable to that of a U-Net model trained solely on SAR data. These findings indicate that SMAGNet enhances the model robustness to missing data as well as the applicability of multimodal deep learning in real-world flood management scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Delayed Acceptance Auxiliary Variable MCMC for Spatial Models with Intractable Likelihood Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17147v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large class of spatial models contains intractable normalizing functions, such as spatial lattice models, interaction spatial point processes, and social network models. Bayesian inference for such models is challenging since the resulting posterior distribution is doubly intractable. Although auxiliary variable MCMC (AVM) algorithms are known to be the most practical, they are computationally expensive due to the repeated auxiliary variable simulations. To address this, we propose delayed-acceptance AVM (DA-AVM) methods, which can reduce the number of auxiliary variable simulations. The first stage of the kernel uses a cheap surrogate to decide whether to accept or reject the proposed parameter value. The second stage guarantees detailed balance with respect to the posterior. The auxiliary variable simulation is performed only on the parameters accepted in the first stage. We construct various surrogates specifically tailored for doubly intractable problems, including subsampling strategy, Gaussian process emulation, and frequentist estimator-based approximation. We validate our method through simulated and real data applications, demonstrating its practicality for complex spatial models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial4D-Bench: A Versatile 4D Spatial Intelligence Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00092v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>4D spatial intelligence involves perceiving and processing how objects move or change over time. Humans naturally possess 4D spatial intelligence, supporting a broad spectrum of spatial reasoning abilities. To what extent can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve human-level 4D spatial intelligence? In this work, we present Spatial4D-Bench, a versatile 4D spatial intelligence benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the 4D spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs. Unlike existing spatial intelligence benchmarks that are often small-scale or limited in diversity, Spatial4D-Bench provides a large-scale, multi-task evaluation benchmark consisting of ~40,000 question-answer pairs covering 18 well-defined tasks. We systematically organize these tasks into six cognitive categories: object understanding, scene understanding, spatial relationship understanding, spatiotemporal relationship understanding, spatial reasoning and spatiotemporal reasoning. Spatial4D-Bench thereby offers a structured and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the spatial cognition abilities of MLLMs, covering a broad spectrum of tasks that parallel the versatility of human spatial intelligence. We benchmark various state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary MLLMs on Spatial4D-Bench and reveal their substantial limitations in a wide variety of 4D spatial reasoning aspects, such as route plan, action recognition, and physical plausibility reasoning. We hope that the findings provided in this work offer valuable insights to the community and that our benchmark can facilitate the development of more capable MLLMs toward human-level 4D spatial intelligence.

| **[Learning Spatial-Aware Manipulation Ordering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25138v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manipulation in cluttered environments is challenging due to spatial dependencies among objects, where an improper manipulation order can cause collisions or blocked access. Existing approaches often overlook these spatial relationships, limiting their flexibility and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose OrderMind, a unified spatial-aware manipulation ordering framework that directly learns object manipulation priorities based on spatial context. Our architecture integrates a spatial context encoder with a temporal priority structuring module. We construct a spatial graph using k-Nearest Neighbors to aggregate geometric information from the local layout and encode both object-object and object-manipulator interactions to support accurate manipulation ordering in real-time. To generate physically and semantically plausible supervision signals, we introduce a spatial prior labeling method that guides a vision-language model to produce reasonable manipulation orders for distillation. We evaluate OrderMind on our Manipulation Ordering Benchmark, comprising 163,222 samples of varying difficulty. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior approaches in effectiveness and efficiency, enabling robust manipulation in cluttered scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[From Sequential to Spatial: Reordering Autoregression for Efficient Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24639v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the remarkable success of autoregressive models in language modeling, this paradigm has been widely adopted in visual generation. However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization. Furthermore, to address the risk of inconsistent predictions arising from simultaneous token generation with limited context, we introduce a nested attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically refines implausible outputs during the forward pass, thereby mitigating error accumulation and preventing model collapse. By integrating radial parallel prediction with dynamic output correction, RadAR significantly improves generation efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Building Blocks to Planning: Multi-Step Spatial Reasoning in LLMs with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24532v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has gained increasing attention due to applications in navigation and planning. Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch. Finally, we analyze attention patterns to assess whether fine-tuning induces meaningful improvements in spatial understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral and Spatial Graph Learning for Multispectral Solar Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24463v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-fidelity compression of multispectral solar imagery remains challenging for space missions, where limited bandwidth must be balanced against preserving fine spectral and spatial details. We present a learned image compression framework tailored to solar observations, leveraging two complementary modules: (1) the Inter-Spectral Windowed Graph Embedding (iSWGE), which explicitly models inter-band relationships by representing spectral channels as graph nodes with learned edge features; and (2) the Windowed Spatial Graph Attention and Convolutional Block Attention (WSGA-C), which combines sparse graph attention with convolutional attention to reduce spatial redundancy and emphasize fine-scale structures. Evaluations on the SDOML dataset across six extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels show that our approach achieves a 20.15%reduction in Mean Spectral Information Divergence (MSID), up to 1.09% PSNR improvement, and a 1.62% log transformed MS-SSIM gain over strong learned baselines, delivering sharper and spectrally faithful reconstructions at comparable bits-per-pixel rates.

| **[Forging Spatial Intelligence: A Roadmap of Multi-Modal Data Pre-Training for Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24385v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of autonomous systems, including self-driving vehicles and drones, has intensified the need to forge true Spatial Intelligence from multi-modal onboard sensor data. While foundation models excel in single-modal contexts, integrating their capabilities across diverse sensors like cameras and LiDAR to create a unified understanding remains a formidable challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for multi-modal pre-training, identifying the core set of techniques driving progress toward this goal. We dissect the interplay between foundational sensor characteristics and learning strategies, evaluating the role of platform-specific datasets in enabling these advancements. Our central contribution is the formulation of a unified taxonomy for pre-training paradigms: ranging from single-modality baselines to sophisticated unified frameworks that learn holistic representations for advanced tasks like 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of textual inputs and occupancy representations to facilitate open-world perception and planning. Finally, we identify critical bottlenecks, such as computational efficiency and model scalability, and propose a roadmap toward general-purpose multi-modal foundation models capable of achieving robust Spatial Intelligence for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 38 pages, 7 figures, 9 tables; GitHub at https://github.com/worldbench/awesome-spatial-intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Spatial-aware Vision Language Model for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24331v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show significant promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging the common sense embedded in language models, their reliance on 2D image cues for complex scene understanding and decision-making presents a critical bottleneck for safety and reliability. Current image-based methods struggle with accurate metric spatial reasoning and geometric inference, leading to unreliable driving policies. To bridge this gap, we propose LVLDrive (LiDAR-Vision-Language), a novel framework specifically designed to upgrade existing VLMs with robust 3D metric spatial understanding for autonomous driving by incoperating LiDAR point cloud as an extra input modality. A key challenge lies in mitigating the catastrophic disturbance introduced by disparate 3D data to the pre-trained VLMs. To this end, we introduce a Gradual Fusion Q-Former that incrementally injects LiDAR features, ensuring the stability and preservation of the VLM's existing knowledge base. Furthermore, we develop a spatial-aware question-answering (SA-QA) dataset to explicitly teach the model advanced 3D perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on driving benchmarks demonstrate that LVLDrive achieves superior performance compared to vision-only counterparts across scene understanding, metric spatial perception, and reliable driving decision-making. Our work highlights the necessity of explicit 3D metric data for building trustworthy VLM-based autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topological Spatial Graph Coarsening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24327v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial graphs are particular graphs for which the nodes are localized in space (e.g., public transport network, molecules, branching biological structures). In this work, we consider the problem of spatial graph reduction, that aims to find a smaller spatial graph (i.e., with less nodes) with the same overall structure as the initial one. In this context, performing the graph reduction while preserving the main topological features of the initial graph is particularly relevant, due to the additional spatial information. Thus, we propose a topological spatial graph coarsening approach based on a new framework that finds a trade-off between the graph reduction and the preservation of the topological characteristics. The coarsening is realized by collapsing short edges. In order to capture the topological information required to calibrate the reduction level, we adapt the construction of classical topological descriptors made for point clouds (the so-called persistent diagrams) to spatial graphs. This construction relies on the introduction of a new filtration called triangle-aware graph filtration. Our coarsening approach is parameter-free and we prove that it is equivariant under rotations, translations and scaling of the initial spatial graph. We evaluate the performances of our method on synthetic and real spatial graphs, and show that it significantly reduces the graph sizes while preserving the relevant topological information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Discretization for Fine-Grain Zone Checks with STARKs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24238v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many location-based services rely on a point-in-polygon test (PiP), checking whether a point or a trajectory lies inside a geographic zone. Since geometric operations are expensive in zero-knowledge proofs, privately performing the PiP test is challenging. In this paper, we answer the research questions of how different ways of encoding zones affect accuracy and proof cost by exploiting gridbased lookup tables under a fixed STARK execution model. Beyond a Boolean grid-based baseline that marks cells as in- or outside, we explore a distance-aware encoding approach that stores how far each cell is from a zone boundary and uses interpolation to reason within a cell. Our experiments on real-world data demonstrate that the proposed distance-aware approach achieves higher accuracy on coarse grids (max. 60%p accuracy gain) with only a moderate verification overhead (approximately 1.4x), making zone encoding the key lever for efficient zero-knowledge spatial checks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Holistic Evaluation of Multimodal LLMs on Spatial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13142v5)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, the very capability that anchors artificial general intelligence in the physical world. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models (GPT, Gemini, Grok, Seed, Qwen, and Intern) stand on the path toward spatial intelligence (SI). We thus propose EASI for holistic Evaluation of multimodAl LLMs on Spatial Intelligence. EASI conceptualizes a comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and a growing collection of newly curated ones, enabling systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models. In this report, we conduct the study across eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding ten billion total tokens. Our empirical study then reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in SI, yet (2) still falls short of human performance significantly across a broad spectrum of SI-tasks. Moreover, we (3) show that SI-tasks expose greater model capability deficiency than non-SI tasks, to the extent that (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult ones. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans, yet fail the most advanced multimodal models. EASI is an ongoing community effort: we have open-sourced the EASI codebase that provides a one-stop and reproducible solution with standardized interfaces, integrated protocols and prompts that significantly reduce the friction of configuring and running multiple benchmarks; we have also launched an accompanying EASI leaderboard to provide a continually updated snapshot of model performance across the full SI spectrum, accelerating collective progress toward robust SI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codeb...</summary><p>Codebase: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/EASI/ ; Leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmms-lab-si/EASI-Leaderboard</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Spatial Intelligence with Multimodal Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13719v3)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite remarkable progress, multimodal foundation models still exhibit surprising deficiencies in spatial intelligence. In this work, we explore scaling up multimodal foundation models to cultivate spatial intelligence within the SenseNova-SI family, built upon established multimodal foundations including visual understanding models (i.e., Qwen3-VL and InternVL3) and unified understanding and generation models (i.e., Bagel). We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application. SenseNova-SI is an ongoing project, and this report will be updated continuously. All newly trained multimodal foundation models are publicly released to facilitate further research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codeb...</summary><p>Codebase: https://github.com/OpenSenseNova/SenseNova-SI ; Models: https://huggingface.co/collections/sensenova/sensenova-si</p></details> |
| **[Deep classifier kriging for probabilistic spatial prediction of air quality index](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23474v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate spatial interpolation of the air quality index (AQI), computed from concentrations of multiple air pollutants, is essential for regulatory decision-making, yet AQI fields are inherently non-Gaussian and often exhibit complex nonlinear spatial structure. Classical spatial prediction methods such as kriging are linear and rely on Gaussian assumptions, which limits their ability to capture these features and to provide reliable predictive distributions. In this study, we propose \textit{deep classifier kriging} (DCK), a flexible, distribution-free deep learning framework for estimating full predictive distribution functions for univariate and bivariate spatial processes, together with a \textit{data fusion} mechanism that enables modeling of non-collocated bivariate processes and integration of heterogeneous air pollution data sources. Through extensive simulation experiments, we show that DCK consistently outperforms conventional approaches in predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification. We further apply DCK to probabilistic spatial prediction of AQI by fusing sparse but high-quality station observations with spatially continuous yet biased auxiliary model outputs, yielding spatially resolved predictive distributions that support downstream tasks such as exceedance and extreme-event probability estimation for regulatory risk assessment and policy formulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SC-Net: Robust Correspondence Learning via Spatial and Cross-Channel Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23473v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has focused on using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the backbones in two-view correspondence learning, demonstrating significant superiority over methods based on multilayer perceptrons. However, CNN backbones that are not tailored to specific tasks may fail to effectively aggregate global context and oversmooth dense motion fields in scenes with large disparity. To address these problems, we propose a novel network named SC-Net, which effectively integrates bilateral context from both spatial and channel perspectives. Specifically, we design an adaptive focused regularization module (AFR) to enhance the model's position-awareness and robustness against spurious motion samples, thereby facilitating the generation of a more accurate motion field. We then propose a bilateral field adjustment module (BFA) to refine the motion field by simultaneously modeling long-range relationships and facilitating interaction across spatial and channel dimensions. Finally, we recover the motion vectors from the refined field using a position-aware recovery module (PAR) that ensures consistency and precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relative pose estimation and outlier removal tasks on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets.

| **[Intrinsic Whittle--Matérn fields and sparse spatial extremes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23395v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrinsic Gaussian fields are used in many areas of statistics as models for spatial or spatio-temporal dependence, or as priors for latent variables. However, there are two major gaps in the literature: first, the number and flexibility of existing intrinsic models are very limited; second, theory, fast inference, and software are currently underdeveloped for intrinsic fields. We tackle these challenges by introducing the new flexible class of intrinsic Whittle--Matérn Gaussian random fields obtained as the solution to a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). Exploiting sparsity resulting from finite-element approximations, we develop fast estimation and simulation methods for these models. We demonstrate the benefits of this intrinsic SPDE approach for the important task of kriging under extrapolation settings. Leveraging the connection of intrinsic fields to spatial extreme value processes, we translate our theory to an SPDE approach for Brown--Resnick processes for sparse modeling of spatial extreme events. This new paradigm paves the way for efficient inference in unprecedented dimensions. To demonstrate the wide applicability of our new methodology, we apply it in two very different areas: a longitudinal study of renal function data, and the modeling of marine heat waves using high-resolution sea surface temperature data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral Analysis of Hard-Constraint PINNs: The Spatial Modulation Mechanism of Boundary Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23295v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks with hard constraints (HC-PINNs) are increasingly favored for their ability to strictly enforce boundary conditions via a trial function ansatz $\tilde{u} = A + B \cdot N$, yet the theoretical mechanisms governing their training dynamics have remained unexplored. Unlike soft-constrained formulations where boundary terms act as additive penalties, this work reveals that the boundary function $B$ introduces a multiplicative spatial modulation that fundamentally alters the learning landscape. A rigorous Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework for HC-PINNs is established, deriving the explicit kernel composition law. This relationship demonstrates that the boundary function $B(\vec{x})$ functions as a spectral filter, reshaping the eigenspectrum of the neural network's native kernel. Through spectral analysis, the effective rank of the residual kernel is identified as a deterministic predictor of training convergence, superior to classical condition numbers. It is shown that widely used boundary functions can inadvertently induce spectral collapse, leading to optimization stagnation despite exact boundary satisfaction. Validated across multi-dimensional benchmarks, this framework transforms the design of boundary functions from a heuristic choice into a principled spectral optimization problem, providing a solid theoretical foundation for geometric hard constraints in scientific machine learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Spatial Confounding Adjustment via Basis Voting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22464v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating effects of spatially structured exposures is complicated by unmeasured spatial confounders, which undermine identifiability in spatial linear regression models unless structural assumptions are imposed. We develop a general framework for effect estimation in spatial regression models that relaxes the commonly assumed requirement that exposures contain higher-frequency variation than confounders. We propose basis voting, a plurality-rule estimator - novel in the spatial literature - that consistently identifies causal effects only under the assumption that, in a spatial basis expansion of the exposure and confounder, there exist several basis functions in the support of the exposure but not the confounder. This assumption generalizes existing assumptions of differential basis support used for identification of the causal effect under spatial confounding, and does not require prior knowledge of which basis functions satisfy this support condition. We design this estimator as the mode of several candidate estimators each computed based on a single working basis function. We also show that the standard projection-based candidate estimator typically used in other plurality-rule based methods is inefficient, and provide a more efficient novel candidate. Extensive simulations and a real-world application demonstrate that our approach reliably recovers unbiased causal estimates whenever exposure and confounder signals are separable on a plurality of basis functions. By not relying on higher-frequency variation, our method remains applicable to settings where exposures are smooth spatial functions, such as distance to pollution sources or major roadways, common in environmental studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>61 pa...</summary><p>61 pages, 9 figures, supplementary appendix included</p></details> |
| **[From Indoor to Open World: Revealing the Spatial Reasoning Gap in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19683v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance on semantic tasks, their spatial intelligence--crucial for robust and grounded AI systems--remains underdeveloped. Existing benchmarks fall short of diagnosing this limitation: they either focus on overly simplified qualitative reasoning or rely on domain-specific indoor data, constrained by the lack of outdoor datasets with verifiable metric ground truth. To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale benchmark built from pedestrian-perspective videos captured with synchronized stereo cameras, LiDAR, and IMU/GPS sensors. This dataset provides metrically precise 3D information, enabling the automatic generation of spatial reasoning questions that span a hierarchical spectrum--from qualitative relational reasoning to quantitative metric and kinematic understanding. Evaluations reveal that the performance gains observed in structured indoor benchmarks vanish in open-world settings. Further analysis using synthetic abnormal scenes and blinding tests confirms that current MLLMs depend heavily on linguistic priors instead of grounded visual reasoning. Our benchmark thus provides a principled platform for diagnosing these limitations and advancing physically grounded spatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://mingrui-wu.github.io/openbench/</p></details> |
| **[Learning Spatial Decay for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09525v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision, yet their self-attention mechanism lacks explicit spatial inductive biases, leading to suboptimal performance on spatially-structured tasks. Existing approaches introduce data-independent spatial decay based on fixed distance metrics, applying uniform attention weighting regardless of image content and limiting adaptability to diverse visual scenarios. Inspired by recent advances in large language models where content-aware gating mechanisms (e.g., GLA, HGRN2, FOX) significantly outperform static alternatives, we present the first successful adaptation of data-dependent spatial decay to 2D vision transformers. We introduce \textbf{Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT)}, featuring a novel Context-Aware Gating (CAG) mechanism that generates dynamic, data-dependent decay for patch interactions. Our approach learns to modulate spatial attention based on both content relevance and spatial proximity. We address the fundamental challenge of 1D-to-2D adaptation through a unified spatial-content fusion framework that integrates manhattan distance-based spatial priors with learned content representations. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and generation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Our work establishes data-dependent spatial decay as a new paradigm for enhancing spatial attention in vision transformers.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |
| **[Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment for Text-guided Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22981v1)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided Medical Image Segmentation has shown considerable promise for medical image segmentation, with rich clinical text serving as an effective supplement for scarce data. However, current methods have two key bottlenecks. On one hand, they struggle to process diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously, making it difficult to identify lesions and establish associations with image regions. On the other hand, existing approaches focus on lesions description and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to critical deviations. Specifically, with the text "in the left lower lung", the segmentation results may incorrectly cover both sides of the lung. To address the limitations, we propose the Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework to enhance the capacity of referring hybrid medical texts consisting of locational, descriptive, and diagnostic information. Specifically, we propose symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism to strengthen the associations between image regions and multiple relevant expressions, which establishes bi-directional fine-grained multimodal correspondences. In addition, we devise a composite directional guidance strategy that explicitly introduces spatial constraints in the text by constructing region-level guidance masks. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that SSA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, particularly in accurately segmenting lesions characterized by spatial relational constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[USTM: Unified Spatial and Temporal Modeling for Continuous Sign Language Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13415v2)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) requires precise spatio-temporal modeling to accurately recognize sequences of gestures in videos. Existing frameworks often rely on CNN-based spatial backbones combined with temporal convolution or recurrent modules. These techniques fail in capturing fine-grained hand and facial cues and modeling long-range temporal dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal Modeling (USTM) framework, a spatio-temporal encoder that effectively models complex patterns using a combination of a Swin Transformer backbone enhanced with lightweight temporal adapter with positional embeddings (TAPE). Our framework captures fine-grained spatial features alongside short and long-term temporal context, enabling robust sign language recognition from RGB videos without relying on multi-stream inputs or auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments on benchmarked datasets including PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14T, and CSL-Daily demonstrate that USTM achieves state-of-the-art performance against RGB-based as well as multi-modal CSLR approaches, while maintaining competitive performance against multi-stream approaches. These results highlight the strength and efficacy of the USTM framework for CSLR. The code is available at https://github.com/gufranSabri/USTM</p></details> |  |
| **[InfSplign: Inference-Time Spatial Alignment of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17851v2)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models generate high-quality images but often fail to capture the spatial relations specified in text prompts. This limitation can be traced to two factors: lack of fine-grained spatial supervision in training data and inability of text embeddings to encode spatial semantics. We introduce InfSplign, a training-free inference-time method that improves spatial alignment by adjusting the noise through a compound loss in every denoising step. Proposed loss leverages different levels of cross-attention maps extracted from the backbone decoder to enforce accurate object placement and a balanced object presence during sampling. The method is lightweight, plug-and-play, and compatible with any diffusion backbone. Our comprehensive evaluations on VISOR and T2I-CompBench show that InfSplign establishes a new state-of-the-art (to the best of our knowledge), achieving substantial performance gains over the strongest existing inference-time baselines and even outperforming the fine-tuning-based methods. Codebase is available at GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Our approach combines multilevel regression with municipal and departmental spatial random effects, and it incorporates Ridge and Lasso regularization priors to compare the contribution of sociodemographic covariates. Inference is implemented in a fully open source workflow using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and model behavior is assessed through synthetic data that mirror key features of the observed data. Simulation results indicate that Ridge provides the most balanced performance in parameter recovery, predictive accuracy, and sampling efficiency, while Lasso shows weaker fit and posterior stability, with gains in predictive accuracy under stronger multicollinearity. In the application, posterior rankings show a strong centralization of performance, with higher scores in central departments and lower scores in peripheral territories, and the strongest correlates of scores are student level living conditions, maternal education, access to educational resources, gender, and ethnic background, while spatial random effects capture residual regional disparities. A hybrid Bayesian segmentation based on K means propagates posterior uncertainty into clustering at departmental, municipal, and spatial scales, revealing multiscale territorial patterns consistent with structural inequalities and informing territorial targeting in education policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 14 tables, 12 figures</p></details> |

However, unconstrained feature matching across domains such as aerial, indoor, and outdoor scenes remains challenging due to large variations in appearance, scale and viewpoint. Feature matching has been conventionally formulated as a 2D-to-2D problem; however, recent 3D foundation models provides spatial feature matching properties based on two-view geometry. While powerful, we observe that these spatially coherent matches often concentrate on dominant planar regions, e.g., walls or ground surfaces, while being less sensitive to fine-grained geometric details, particularly under large viewpoint changes. To better understand these trade-offs, we first perform linear probe experiments to evaluate the performance of various vision foundation models for image matching. Building on these insights, we introduce SPIDER, a universal feature matching framework that integrates a shared feature extraction backbone with two specialized network heads for estimating both 2D-based and 3D-based correspondences from coarse to fine. Finally, we introduce an image-matching evaluation benchmark that focuses on unconstrained scenarios with large baselines. SPIDER significantly outperforms SoTA methods, demonstrating its strong ability as a universal image-matching method.</p></details> |  |

While experimental techniques like spatial transcriptomics now enable high-resolution mapping of tissue organization across space and time, current methods that model cellular evolution operate at the single-cell level, overlooking the coordinated development of cellular states in a tissue. We introduce NicheFlow, a flow-based generative model that infers the temporal trajectory of cellular microenvironments across sequential spatial slides. By representing local cell neighborhoods as point clouds, NicheFlow jointly models the evolution of cell states and spatial coordinates using optimal transport and Variational Flow Matching. Our approach successfully recovers both global spatial architecture and local microenvironment composition across diverse spatiotemporal datasets, from embryonic to brain development.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 15 figures, to appear in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

By compressing the smoothing aperture, the proposed VWS Coarray MUSIC (VWS-CA-MUSIC) and VWS Coarray root-MUSIC (VWS-CA-rMUSIC) algorithms replace part of the perturbed rank-one outer products in the smoothed coarray data with unperturbed low-rank additional terms, increasing the separation between signal and noise subspaces, while preserving the signal subspace span. We also derive the bounds that guarantees identifiability, by limiting the values that can be assumed by the compression parameter. Simulations with sparse geometries reveal significant performance improvements and complexity savings relative to the fixed-window coarray MUSIC method.</p></details> | 2 figures, 5 pages |

Since the anomaly is quite ambiguous and unbounded, different detection demands may often be raised even in one scenario. Thus, we propose to design the configurable VAD with flexible solutions targeting to solve the issue that previous methods have to train their models from scratch and waste resources when detection demands even change slightly. Moreover, we also design a dataset with good compatibility to evaluate the VAD performance when changes happen in detection demands. Besides, videos contain important information regarding continuous changes in the object's appearance and motion. Thus, we also propose a module to establish the multi-scale spatial-temporal coherence, which improves the accuracy and has the ability to dynamically adjust and accurately capture spatial-temporal normal patterns. Experiments show that our method not only models coherence effectively but also has better configurable ability.</p></details> |  |

Although frontier AI agents have improved dramatically at software engineering and general data analysis, it remains unclear whether they can extract biological insight from messy, real-world spatial datasets. We introduce SpatialBench, a benchmark of 146 verifiable problems derived from practical spatial analysis workflows spanning five spatial technologies and seven task categories. Each problem provides a snapshot of experimental data immediately prior to an analysis step and a deterministic grader that evaluates recovery of a key biological result. Benchmark data on frontier models shows that base model accuracy remains low (20-38% across model families), with strong model-task and model-platform interactions. Harness design has a large empirical effect on performance, indicating that tools, prompts, control flow, and execution environment should be evaluated and improved as first-class objects. SpatialBench serves both as a measurement tool and a diagnostic lens for developing agents that can interact with real spatial datasets faithfully, transparently, and reproducibly.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables; NeurIPS 2024 format</p></details> |
| **[S$^2$Edit: Text-Guided Image Editing with Precise Semantic and Spatial Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04584v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality generation and manipulation of images guided by texts, as well as concept learning from images. However, naive applications of existing methods to editing tasks that require fine-grained control, e.g., face editing, often lead to suboptimal solutions with identity information and high-frequency details lost during the editing process, or irrelevant image regions altered due to entangled concepts. In this work, we propose S$^2$Edit, a novel method based on a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model that enables personalized editing with precise semantic and spatial control. We first fine-tune our model to embed the identity information into a learnable text token. During fine-tuning, we disentangle the learned identity token from attributes to be edited by enforcing an orthogonality constraint in the textual feature space. To ensure that the identity token only affects regions of interest, we apply object masks to guide the cross-attention maps. At inference time, our method performs localized editing while faithfully preserving the original identity with semantically disentangled and spatially focused identity token learned. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$Edit over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally, we showcase several compositional image editing applications of S$^2$Edit such as makeup transfer.</p></details> |  |

Unlike in Gaussian likelihoods, inference is considerably encumbered by the inability to analytically integrate out the random effects and reduce the dimension of the parameter space. Iterative estimation algorithms struggle to converge due to the presence of weakly identified parameters. We devise Bayesian inference using predictive stacking that assimilates inference from analytically tractable conditional posterior distributions. We achieve this by expanding upon the Diaconis-Ylvisaker family of conjugate priors and exploiting generalised conjugate multivariate (GCM) distribution theory for exponential families, which enables exact sampling from analytically available posterior distributions conditional upon some process parameters. Subsequently, we assimilate inference over a range of values of these parameters using Bayesian predictive stacking. We evaluate inferential performance on simulated data, compare with full Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and apply our method to analyse spatially-temporally referenced avian count data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey database.</p></details> | 41 pages, 9 figures |

However, diverse generation techniques and class imbalance in datasets create challenges. We propose CAE-Net, a Convolution- and Attention-based weighted Ensemble network combining spatial and frequency-domain features for effective deepfake detection. The architecture integrates EfficientNet, Data-Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), and ConvNeXt with wavelet features to learn complementary representations. We evaluated CAE-Net on the diverse IEEE Signal Processing Cup 2025 (DF-Wild Cup) dataset, which has a 5:1 fake-to-real class imbalance. To address this, we introduce a multistage disjoint-subset training strategy, sequentially training the model on non-overlapping subsets of the fake class while retaining knowledge across stages. Our approach achieved $94.46\%$ accuracy and a $97.60\%$ AUC, outperforming conventional class-balancing methods. Visualizations confirm the network focuses on meaningful facial regions, and our ensemble design demonstrates robustness against adversarial attacks, positioning CAE-Net as a dependable and generalized deepfake detection framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation</p></details> |

Recent spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) excel in multi-node optimization and spin glass simulations, leveraging their large-scale and fully connected characteristics. However, existing laser diffraction-based SPIMs usually sacrifice time efficiency or spin count to encode high-rank spin-spin coupling and external fields, limiting their scalability for real-world applications. Here, we demonstrate an amplitude-only modulated rank-free spatial photonic Ising machine (AR-SPIM) with 200 iterations per second. By re-formulating an arbitrary Ising Hamiltonian as the sum of Hadamard products, followed by loading the corresponding matrices/vectors onto an aligned amplitude spatial light modulator and digital micro-mirrors device, we directly map a 797-spin Ising model with external fields (nearly 9-bit precision, -255 to 255) into an incoherent light field, eliminating the need for repeated and auxiliary operations. Serving as encoding accuracy metrics, the linear coefficient of determination and Pearson correlation coefficient between measured light intensities and Ising Hamiltonians exceed 0.9800, with values exceed 0.9997 globally. The AR-SPIM achieves less than 0.3% error rate for ground-state search of biased Max-cut problems with arbitrary ranks and weights, enables complex phase transition observations, and facilitates scalable spin counts for sparse Ising problems via removing zero-valued Hadamard product terms. This reconfigurable AR-SPIM can be further developed to support large-scale machine-learning training and deployed for practical applications in discrete optimization and quantum many-body simulations.</p></details> | 4 pages, 3 figures |

Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however, they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

We present INSIGHT, a graph neural network that predicts survival directly from routine histology images. Trained and cross-validated on TCGA (n=342) and SURGEN (n=336), INSIGHT produces patient-level spatially resolved risk scores. Large independent validation showed superior prognostic performance compared with pTNM staging (C-index 0.68-0.69 vs 0.44-0.58). INSIGHT spatial risk maps recapitulated canonical prognostic histopathology and identified nuclear solidity and circularity as quantitative risk correlates. Integrating spatial risk with data-driven spatial transcriptomic signatures, spatial proteomics, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell references revealed an epithelium-immune risk manifold capturing epithelial dedifferentiation and fetal programs, myeloid-driven stromal states including $\mathrm{SPP1}^{+}$ macrophages and $\mathrm{LAMP3}^{+}$ dendritic cells, and adaptive immune dysfunction. This analysis exposed patient-specific epithelial heterogeneity, stratification within MSI-High tumours, and high-risk routes of CDX2/HNF4A loss and CEACAM5/6-associated proliferative programs, highlighting coordinated therapeutic vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |

A popular family of DoA estimation algorithms is beamforming methods, which operate by constructing a spatial filter that is applied to array signals. However, these spatial filters obtained by traditional model-driven beamforming algorithms fail under demanding conditions such as coherent sources and a small number of snapshots. In order to obtain a robust spatial filter, this paper proposes BeamformNet-a novel deep learning framework grounded in beamforming principles. Based on the concept of optimal spatial filters, BeamformNet leverages neural networks to approximately obtain the optimal spatial filter via implicit spatial signal focusing and noise suppression, which is then applied to received signals for spatial focusing and noise suppression, thereby enabling accurate DoA estimation. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world speech acoustic source localization data demonstrate that BeamformNet achieves state-of-the-art DoA estimation performance and has better robustness.</p></details> |  |

Visual programming addresses this by decomposing problems into steps calling specialized tools, yet existing methods rely on either fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before solving problems, resulting in suboptimal programs and poor utilization of induced tools. We present Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a novel framework that builds new tools from its own experience rather than speculation. TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating experiential solutions into an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns from these programs into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library. This allows TVP to tackle new problems with increasingly powerful tools learned from experience. On Omni3D-Bench, TVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and the previous best visual programming system by 11%. Our transductively learned tools are used 5x more frequently as core program dependency than inductively created ones, demonstrating more effective tool discovery and reuse. The evolved tools also show strong generalization to unseen spatial tasks, achieving superior performance on benchmarks from SpatialScore-Hard collection without any testset-specific modification. Our work establishes experience-driven transductive tool creation as a powerful paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents that effectively tackle challenging spatial reasoning tasks.

Existing dynamic sparsity accelerators falter under LTPP scenarios due to stage-isolated optimizations. Revisiting the end-to-end sparsity acceleration flow, we identify an overlooked opportunity: cross-stage coordination can substantially reduce redundant computation and memory access. We propose STAR, a cross-stage compute- and memory-efficient algorithm-hardware co-design tailored for Transformer inference under LTPP. STAR introduces a leading-zero-based sparsity prediction using log-domain add-only operations to minimize prediction overhead. It further employs distributed sorting and a sorted updating FlashAttention mechanism, guided by a coordinated tiling strategy that enables fine-grained stage interaction for improved memory efficiency and latency. These optimizations are supported by a dedicated STAR accelerator architecture, achieving up to 9.2$\times$ speedup and 71.2$\times$ energy efficiency over A100, and surpassing SOTA accelerators by up to 16.1$\times$ energy and 27.1$\times$ area efficiency gains. Further, we deploy STAR onto a multi-core spatial architecture, optimizing dataflow and execution orchestration for ultra-long sequence processing. Architectural evaluation shows that, compared to the baseline design, Spatial-STAR achieves a 20.1$\times$ throughput improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Computers.

First, based on a B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis strategy, a three-dimensional pipeline three-view feature evaluation method is established by cross-validating forward simulation results obtained using FDTD methods with actual measurement data. Second, the DCO-YOLO framework is proposed, which integrates DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention cross-dimensional correlation mechanisms into the original YOLOv11 algorithm, significantly improving the small-scale pipeline edge feature extraction capability. Furthermore, a 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm is proposed, which integrates three-dimensional geometric constraints and center distance penalty terms to achieve automated association of multi-view annotations. The three-view fusion strategy resolves inherent ambiguities in single-view detection. Experiments based on real urban underground pipeline data show that the proposed method achieves accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of 96.2%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively, in complex multi-pipeline scenarios, which are 2.0%, 2.1%, and 0.9% higher than the baseline model. Ablation experiments validated the synergistic optimization effect of the dynamic feature enhancement module and Grad-CAM++ heatmap visualization demonstrated that the improved model significantly enhanced its ability to focus on pipeline geometric features. This study integrates deep learning optimization strategies with the physical characteristics of 3D GPR, offering an efficient and reliable novel technical framework for the intelligent recognition and localization of underground pipelines.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are limited to temporal localization of when the object is in its initial state (e.g., cheese block) versus when it has completed a state change (e.g., grated cheese), offering no insight into where the change is unfolding. We propose to deepen the problem by introducing the spatially-progressing object state change segmentation task. The goal is to segment at the pixel-level those regions of an object that are actionable and those that are transformed. We show that state-of-the-art VLMs and video segmentation methods struggle at this task, underscoring its difficulty and novelty. As an initial baseline, we design a VLM-based pseudo-labeling approach, state-change dynamics constraints, and a novel WhereToChange benchmark built on in-the-wild Internet videos. Experiments on two datasets validate both the challenge of the new task as well as the promise of our model for localizing exactly where and how fast objects are changing in video. We further demonstrate useful implications for tracking activity progress to benefit robotic agents. Overall, our work positions spatial OSC segmentation as a new frontier task for video understanding: one that challenges current SOTA methods and invites the community to build more robust, state-change-sensitive representations.

Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>webpa...</summary><p>webpage: https://spatialtree.github.io/</p></details> |

The benchmark decomposes performance into five skills: (i) reconstructing cube faces from images and text, (ii) choosing the optimal next move, (iii) predicting the outcome of a candidate move without applying it, (iv) executing multi-step plans while recovering from mistakes, and (v) detecting and revising one's own errors. Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity. A simple self-correction via reflective thinking yields modest gains but can also introduce overthinking. Cube Bench offers a compact, reproducible probe of sequential spatial reasoning in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables.

To bridge this gap across aspects of dataset, benchmark and model, we introduce DSR Suite. First, we propose an automated pipeline that generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos for DSR. By leveraging modern vision foundation models, the pipeline extracts rich geometric and motion information, including camera poses, local point clouds, object masks, orientations, and 3D trajectories. These geometric cues enable the construction of DSR-Train for learning and further human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation. Compared with previous works, our data emphasize (i) in-the-wild video sources, (ii) object- and scene-level 3D requirements, (iii) viewpoint transformations, (iv) multi-object interactions, and (v) fine-grained, procedural answers. Beyond data, we propose a lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to seamlessly integrate geometric priors into VLMs, which condenses question semantics and extracts question-relevant knowledge from pretrained 4D reconstruction priors into a compact set of geometry tokens. This targeted extraction avoids overwhelming the model with irrelevant knowledge. Experiments show that integrating DSR-Train and GSM into Qwen2.5-VL-7B significantly enhances its dynamic spatial reasoning capability, while maintaining accuracy on general video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging both for speaker extraction in challenging data conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20165v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a robust multi-channel speaker extraction algorithm designed to handle inaccuracies in reference information. While existing approaches often rely solely on either spatial or spectral cues to identify the target speaker, our method integrates both sources of information to enhance robustness. A key aspect of our approach is its emphasis on stability, ensuring reliable performance even when one of the features is degraded or misleading. Given a noisy mixture and two potentially unreliable cues, a dedicated network is trained to dynamically balance their contributions-or disregard the less informative one when necessary. We evaluate the system under challenging conditions by simulating inference-time errors using a simple direction of arrival (DOA) estimator and a noisy spectral enrollment process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model successfully extracts the desired speaker even in the presence of substantial reference inaccuracies.</p></details> |  |

However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |
| **[A Markov Chain Modeling Approach for Predicting Relative Risks of Spatial Clusters in Public Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19635v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting relative risk (RR) of spatial clusters is a complex task in public health that can be achieved through various statistical and machine-learning methods for different time intervals. However, high-resolution longitudinal data is often unavailable to successfully apply such methods. The goal of the present study is to further develop and test a new methodology proposed in our previous work for accurate sequential RR predictions in the case of limited lon gitudinal data. In particular, we first use a well-known likelihood ratio test to identify significant spatial clusters over user-defined time intervals. Then we apply a Markov chain modeling ap approach to predict RR values for each time interval. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed approach yields better performance with COVID-19 morbidity data compared to the previous study on mortality data. Additionally, increasing the number of time intervals enhances the accuracy of the proposed Markov chain modeling method.</p></details> |  |

Although diffusion models are promising, existing methods struggle: global prompt-guided approaches corrupt normal regions, and existing inpainting-based methods often lack the in-distribution diversity essential for robust downstream models. We propose MAGIC, a fine-tuned inpainting framework that generates high-fidelity anomalies that strictly adhere to the mask while maximizing this diversity. MAGIC introduces three complementary components: (i) Gaussian prompt perturbation, which prevents model overfitting in the few-shot setting by learning and sampling from a smooth manifold of realistic anomalies, (ii) spatially adaptive guidance that applies distinct guidance strengths to the anomaly and background regions, and (iii) context-aware mask alignment to relocate masks for plausible placement within the host object. Under consistent identical evaluation protocol, MAGIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on diverse anomaly datasets in downstream tasks</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 47 figures.

Most existing studies rely on evolutionary update rules or value-based reinforcement learning methods. These approaches struggle to represent payoff coupling and non-stationarity in large interacting populations. This work introduces Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) into spatial public goods games for the first time. In these games, individual returns are intrinsically coupled through overlapping group interactions. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) treats agents as independent learners and ignores this coupling during value estimation. MAPPO addresses this limitation through a centralized critic that evaluates joint strategy configurations. To study neighborhood-level cooperation signals under this framework, we propose MAPPO with Local Cooperation Reward, termed MAPPO-LCR. The local cooperation reward aligns policy updates with surrounding cooperative density without altering the original game structure. MAPPO-LCR preserves decentralized execution while enabling population-level value estimation during training. Extensive simulations demonstrate stable cooperation emergence and reliable convergence across enhancement factors. Statistical analyses further confirm the learning advantage of MAPPO over PPO in spatial public goods games.</p></details> |  |

Spatial reasoning is a key component of human intelligence, but most existing benchmarks focus on static images or final outputs, failing to account for the sequential and viewpoint-dependent nature of this skill. To close this gap, we introduce GamiBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial reasoning and 2D-to-3D planning in MLLMs through origami-inspired folding tasks. GamiBench includes 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with their corresponding 3D folded shapes, produced from six distinct viewpoints across three visual question-answering (VQA) tasks: predicting 3D fold configurations, distinguishing valid viewpoints, and detecting impossible patterns. Unlike previous benchmarks that assess only final predictions, GamiBench holistically evaluates the entire reasoning process--measuring cross-view consistency, physical feasibility through impossible-fold detection, and interpretation of intermediate folding steps. It further introduces new diagnostic metrics--viewpoint consistency (VC) and impossible fold selection rate (IFSR)--to measure how well models handle folds of varying complexity. Our experiments show that even leading models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle on single-step spatial understanding. These contributions establish a standardized framework for evaluating geometric understanding and spatial reasoning in MLLMs. Dataset and code: https://github.com/stvngo/GamiBench.</p></details> |  |

However, most of those results have not been tested explicitly for reproducibility and might be prone to biases in the study samples or models. Many studies on the topic do not adequately control for genealogical and areal dependencies between sampled languages, casting doubts on the robustness of the results. In this study, we test the robustness of a recent study on sound symbolism of basic vocabulary concepts which analyzed 245 languages.The new sample includes data on 2864 languages from Lexibank. We modify the original model by adding statistical controls for spatial and phylogenetic dependencies between languages. The new results show that most of the previously observed patterns are not robust, and in fact many patterns disappear completely when adding the genealogical and areal controls. A small number of patterns, however, emerges as highly stable even with the new sample. Through the new analysis, we are able to assess the distribution of sound symbolism on a larger scale than previously. The study further highlights the need for testing all universal claims on language for robustness on various levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted with minor revisions at *Linguistic Typology*, expected to be fully published in 2026</p></details> |
| **[Non-stationary Spatial Modeling Using Fractional SPDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18768v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We construct a Gaussian random field (GRF) that combines fractional smoothness with spatially varying anisotropy. The GRF is defined through a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE), where the range, marginal variance, and anisotropy vary spatially according to a spectral parametrization of the SPDE coefficients. Priors are constructed to reduce overfitting in this flexible covariance model, and parameter estimation is done with an efficient gradient-based optimization approach that combines automatic differentiation with sparse matrix operations. In a simulation study, we investigate how many observations are required to reliably estimate fractional smoothness and non-stationarity, and find that one realization containing 500 observations or more is needed in the scenario considered. We also find that the proposed penalization prevents overfitting across varying numbers of observation locations. Two case studies demonstrate that the relative importance of fractional smoothness and non-stationarity is application dependent. Non-stationarity improves predictions in an application to ocean salinity, whereas fractional smoothness improves predictions in an application to precipitation. Predictive ability is assessed using mean squared error and the continuous ranked probability score. In addition to prediction, the proposed approach can be used as a tool to explore the presence of fractional smoothness and non-stationarity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reorienting Age-Friendly Frameworks for Rural Contexts: A Spatial Competence-Press Framework for Aging in Chinese Villages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20343v2)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While frameworks such as the WHO Age-Friendly Cities have advanced urban aging policy, rural contexts demand fundamentally different analytical approaches. The spatial dispersion, terrain variability, and agricultural labor dependencies that characterize rural aging experiences require moving beyond service-domain frameworks toward spatial stress assessment models. Current research on rural aging in China exhibits methodological gaps, systematically underrepresenting the spatial stressors that older adults face daily, including terrain barriers, infrastructure limitations, climate exposure, and agricultural labor burdens. Existing rural revitalization policies emphasize standardized interventions while inadequately addressing spatial heterogeneity and the spatially-differentiated needs of aging populations. This study developed a GIS-based spatial stress analysis framework that applies Lawton and Nahemow's competence-press model to quantify aging-related stressors and classify rural villages by intervention needs. Using data from 27 villages in Mamuchi Township, Shandong Province, we established four spatial stress indicators: slope gradient index (SGI), solar radiation exposure index (SREI), walkability index (WI), and agricultural intensity index (AII). Analysis of variance and hierarchical clustering revealed significant variation in spatial pressures across villages and identified distinct typologies that require targeted intervention strategies. The framework produces both quantitative stress measurements for individual villages and a classification system that groups villages with similar stress patterns, providing planners and policymakers with practical tools for designing spatially-targeted age-friendly interventions in rural China and similar contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Urban Studies</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel Semantic and Spatial Rectification (SSR) method to address the limitations of existing CLIP-based weakly supervised semantic segmentation approaches: over-activation in non-target foreground regions and background areas. Specifically, at the semantic level, the Cross-Modal Prototype Alignment (CMPA) establishes a contrastive learning mechanism to enforce feature space alignment across modalities, reducing inter-class overlap while enhancing semantic correlations, to rectify over-activation in non-target foreground regions effectively; at the spatial level, the Superpixel-Guided Correction (SGC) leverages superpixel-based spatial priors to precisely filter out interference from non-target regions during affinity propagation, significantly rectifying background over-activation. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all single-stage approaches, as well as more complex multi-stage approaches, achieving mIoU scores of 79.5% and 50.6%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Investigating Spatial Attention Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18231v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding visual content, yet systematic biases in their spatial processing remain largely unexplored. This work identifies and characterizes a systematic spatial attention bias where VLMs consistently prioritize describing left-positioned content before right-positioned content in horizontally concatenated images. Through controlled experiments on image pairs using both open-source and closed-source models, we demonstrate that this bias persists across different architectures, with models describing left-positioned content first in approximately 97% of cases under neutral prompting conditions. Testing on an Arabic-finetuned model reveals that the bias persists despite right-to-left language training, ruling out language reading direction as the primary cause. Investigation of training dataset annotation guidelines from PixMo and Visual Genome reveals no explicit left-first ordering instructions, suggesting the bias is consistent with architectural factors rather than explicit training data instructions. These findings reveal fundamental limitations in how current VLMs process spatial information.</p></details> |  |

This study developed a quantitative framework to evaluate the spatial openness in housing from two- (2D) and three- (3D) dimensional perspectives. Using data from 4,004 rental units in Tokyo's 23 wards, we examined the temporal and spatial variations in openness and its relationship with rent and housing attributes. 2D openness was computed via planar visibility using visibility graph analysis (VGA) from floor plans, whereas 3D openness was derived from interior images analysed using Mask2Former, a semantic segmentation model that identifies walls, ceilings, floors, and windows. The results showed an increase in living room visibility and a 1990s peak in overall openness. Spatial analyses revealed partial correlations among openness, rent, and building characteristics, reflecting urban redevelopment trends. Although the 2D and 3D openness indicators were not directly correlated, higher openness tended to correspond to higher rent. The impression scores predicted by the existing models were only weakly related to openness, suggesting that the interior design and furniture more strongly shape perceived space. This study offers a new multidimensional data-driven framework for quantifying residential spatial openness and linking it with urban and market dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Although recent studies have led to the advent of deep learning methods using satellite imagery to predict height maps, these approaches often face a trade-off between data accessibility and spatial resolution. To overcome these limitations, we present SERA-H, an end-to-end model combining a super-resolution module (EDSR) and temporal attention encoding (UTAE). Trained under the supervision of high-density LiDAR data (ALS), our model generates 2.5 m resolution height maps from freely available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (10 m) time series data. Evaluated on an open-source benchmark dataset in France, SERA-H, with a MAE of 2.6 m and a coefficient of determination of 0.82, not only outperforms standard Sentinel-1/2 baselines but also achieves performance comparable to or better than methods relying on commercial very high-resolution imagery (SPOT-6/7, PlanetScope, Maxar). These results demonstrate that combining high-resolution supervision with the spatiotemporal information embedded in time series enables the reconstruction of details beyond the input sensors' native resolution. SERA-H opens the possibility of freely mapping forests with high revisit frequency, achieving accuracy comparable to that of costly commercial imagery.

A common approach is to fit a spatial regression that models the outcome as a linear function of treatment and covariates, with a spatially structured error term to account for unmeasured spatial confounding. However, it remains unclear to what extent spatial regression actually accounts for such forms of confounding in finite samples, and whether this regression adjustment can be reformulated from a design-based perspective. Motivated by an observational study on the effect of Superfund site remediation on birth outcomes, we present a weighting framework for causal inference that unifies three canonical classes of spatial regression models$\unicode{x2013}$random effects, conditional autoregressive, and Gaussian process models$\unicode{x2013}$and reveals how they implicitly construct causal contrasts across space. Specifically, we show that: (i) the spatial error term induces approximate balance on a latent set of covariates and therefore adjusts for a specific form of unmeasured confounding; and (ii) the covariance structure of the spatial error can be equivalently represented as regressors in a linear model. Building on these insights, we introduce a new estimator that jointly addresses multiple forms of unmeasured spatial confounding and develop visual diagnostics. Using our new estimator, we find evidence of a small but beneficial effect of remediation on the percentage of small vulnerable newborns.</p></details> | <details><summary>72 pa...</summary><p>72 pages, 12 figures, 7 tables (includes supplement)</p></details> |

However, cloud contamination frequently obscures LST observations, limiting their usability for continuous SUHI analysis. Most existing LST reconstruction methods rely on multitemporal information or multisensor data fusion, requiring auxiliary observations that may be unavailable or unreliable under persistent cloud cover. Purely spatial gap-filling approaches offer an alternative, but traditional statistical methods degrade under large or spatially contiguous gaps, while many deep learning based spatial models deteriorate rapidly with increasing missingness. Recent advances in denoising diffusion based image inpainting models have demonstrated improved robustness under high missingness, motivating their adoption for spatial LST reconstruction. In this work, we introduce UrbanDIFF, a purely spatial denoising diffusion model for reconstructing cloud contaminated urban LST imagery. The model is conditioned on static urban structure information, including built-up surface data and a digital elevation model, and enforces strict consistency with revealed cloud free pixels through a supervised pixel guided refinement step during inference. UrbanDIFF is trained and evaluated using NASA MODIS Terra LST data from seven major United States metropolitan areas spanning 2002 to 2025. Experiments using synthetic cloud masks with 20 to 85 percent coverage show that UrbanDIFF consistently outperforms an interpolation baseline, particularly under dense cloud occlusion, achieving SSIM of 0.89, RMSE of 1.2 K, and R2 of 0.84 at 85 percent cloud coverage, while exhibiting slower performance degradation as cloud density increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially-informed transformers: Injecting geostatistical covariance biases into self-attention for spatio-temporal forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17696v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The modeling of high-dimensional spatio-temporal processes presents a fundamental dichotomy between the probabilistic rigor of classical geostatistics and the flexible, high-capacity representations of deep learning. While Gaussian processes offer theoretical consistency and exact uncertainty quantification, their prohibitive computational scaling renders them impractical for massive sensor networks. Conversely, modern transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling but inherently lack a geometric inductive bias, treating spatial sensors as permutation-invariant tokens without a native understanding of distance. In this work, we propose a spatially-informed transformer, a hybrid architecture that injects a geostatistical inductive bias directly into the self-attention mechanism via a learnable covariance kernel. By formally decomposing the attention structure into a stationary physical prior and a non-stationary data-driven residual, we impose a soft topological constraint that favors spatially proximal interactions while retaining the capacity to model complex dynamics. We demonstrate the phenomenon of ``Deep Variography'', where the network successfully recovers the true spatial decay parameters of the underlying process end-to-end via backpropagation. Extensive experiments on synthetic Gaussian random fields and real-world traffic benchmarks confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks. Furthermore, rigorous statistical validation confirms that the proposed method delivers not only superior predictive accuracy but also well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts, effectively bridging the gap between physics-aware modeling and data-driven learning.</p></details> |  |

Existing models often overlook the interaction between spatial structure, market design, and adaptive firm behavior, limiting our understanding of where and how symbiosis arises. We develop an agent-based model where heterogeneous firms trade byproducts through a spatially embedded double-auction market, with prices and quantities emerging endogenously from local interactions. Leveraging reinforcement learning, firms adapt their bidding strategies to maximize profit while accounting for transport costs, disposal penalties, and resource scarcity. Simulation experiments reveal the economic and spatial conditions under which decentralized exchanges converge toward stable and efficient outcomes. Counterfactual regret analysis shows that sellers' strategies approach a near Nash equilibrium, while sensitivity analysis highlights how spatial structures and market parameters jointly govern circularity. Our model provides a basis for exploring policy interventions that seek to align firm incentives with sustainability goals, and more broadly demonstrates how decentralized coordination can emerge from adaptive agents in spatially constrained markets.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAMAS...</summary><p>AAMAS CC-BY 4.0 licence.

Current geo-spatial benchmarks have limited coverage across modalities, considerably restricting progress in the field, as current approaches cannot integrate all relevant modalities within a unified framework. We introduce the Multi-Modal Landmark dataset (MMLANDMARKS), a benchmark composed of four modalities: 197k highresolution aerial images, 329k ground-view images, textual information, and geographic coordinates for 18,557 distinct landmarks in the United States. The MMLANDMARKS dataset has a one-to-one correspondence across every modality, which enables training and benchmarking models for various geo-spatial tasks, including cross-view Ground-to-Satellite retrieval, ground and satellite geolocalization, Text-to-Image, and Text-to-GPS retrieval. We demonstrate broad generalization and competitive performance against off-the-shelf foundational models and specialized state-of-the-art models across different tasks by employing a simple CLIP-inspired baseline, illustrating the necessity for multimodal datasets to achieve broad geo-spatial understanding.</p></details> |  |

| **[Neuro-Symbolic Control with Large Language Models for Language-Guided Spatial Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17321v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have recently become effective tools for language-conditioned control in embodied systems, instability, slow convergence, and hallucinated actions continue to limit their direct application to continuous control. A modular neuro-symbolic control framework that clearly distinguishes between low-level motion execution and high-level semantic reasoning is proposed in this work. While a lightweight neural delta controller performs bounded, incremental actions in continuous space, a locally deployed LLM interprets symbolic tasks. We assess the suggested method in a planar manipulation setting with spatial relations between objects specified by language. Numerous tasks and local language models, such as Mistral, Phi, and LLaMA-3.2, are used in extensive experiments to compare LLM-only control, neural-only control, and the suggested LLM+DL framework. In comparison to LLM-only baselines, the results show that the neuro-symbolic integration consistently increases both success rate and efficiency, achieving average step reductions exceeding 70% and speedups of up to 8.83x while remaining robust to language model quality. The suggested framework enhances interpretability, stability, and generalization without any need of reinforcement learning or costly rollouts by controlling the LLM to symbolic outputs and allocating uninterpreted execution to a neural controller trained on artificial geometric data. These outputs show empirically that neuro-symbolic decomposition offers a scalable and principled way to integrate language understanding with ongoing control, this approach promotes the creation of dependable and effective language-guided embodied systems.</p></details> |  |

However, most deep-learning-based methods rely on extensive data or require prior information, which poses challenges in real-world scenarios with limited labeled data. We propose an integrated complex variational mode decomposition algorithm that decomposes and reconstructs complex-valued signals to approximate the original transmitted signals, thereby enabling more accurate feature extraction. We further utilize a temporal convolutional network to effectively model the sequential signal characteristics, and introduce a spatial attention mechanism to adaptively weight informative signal segments, significantly enhancing identification performance. Additionally, the branch network allows leveraging pre-trained weights from other data while reducing the need for auxiliary datasets. Ablation experiments on the simulated data demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of the model.

Here, we introduce a computational framework that predicts spatial pathway activity directly from hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained histology images at microscale resolution 55 and 100 um. Using image features derived from a computational pathology foundation model, we found that TGFb signaling was the most accurately predicted pathway across three independent breast and lung cancer ST datasets. In 87-88% of reliably predicted cases, the resulting spatial TGFb activity maps reflected the expected contrast between tumor and adjacent non-tumor regions, consistent with the known role of TGFb in regulating interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Notably, linear and nonlinear predictive models performed similarly, suggesting that image features may relate to pathway activity in a predominantly linear fashion or that nonlinear structure is small relative to measurement noise. These findings demonstrate that features extracted from routine histopathology may recover spatially coherent and biologically interpretable pathway patterns, offering a scalable strategy for integrating image-based inference with ST information in tumor microenvironment studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have to make substantial updates, thank you</p></details> |

In this work, we propose N3D-VLM, a novel unified framework that seamlessly integrates native 3D object perception with 3D-aware visual reasoning, enabling both precise 3D grounding and interpretable spatial understanding. Unlike conventional end-to-end models that directly predict answers from RGB/RGB-D inputs, our approach equips the model with native 3D object perception capabilities, enabling it to directly localize objects in 3D space based on textual descriptions. Building upon accurate 3D object localization, the model further performs explicit reasoning in 3D, achieving more interpretable and structured spatial understanding. To support robust training for these capabilities, we develop a scalable data construction pipeline that leverages depth estimation to lift large-scale 2D annotations into 3D space, significantly increasing the diversity and coverage for 3D object grounding data, yielding over six times larger than the largest existing single-image 3D detection dataset. Moreover, the pipeline generates spatial question-answering datasets that target chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in 3D, facilitating joint training for both 3D object localization and 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified framework not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D grounding tasks, but also consistently surpasses existing methods in 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://n3d-vlm.github.io</p></details> |

Conventional underwater acoustic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems primarily utilize spatial diversity but suffer from limited array resolution, causing angular ambiguity and insufficient spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). This paper addresses these limitations through acoustic Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (aRIS) to actively generate orthogonally distinguishable virtual paths, significantly enhancing spatial DoFs and channel capacity. An ocean-specific DoF-channel coupling model is established, explicitly deriving conditions for spatial rank enhancement. Subsequently, the optimal geometric locus, termed the Light-Point, is analytically identified, where deploying a single aRIS maximizes DoFs by introducing two and three additional resolvable paths in deep-sea and shallow-sea environments, respectively. Furthermore, an active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting (ASTAR) aRIS architecture with independent beam control and adaptive beam-tracking mechanism integrating unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and acoustic intensity gradient sensing is proposed. Extensive simulations validate the proposed joint aRIS deployment and beamforming framework, demonstrating substantial UWA channel capacity improvements-up to 265% and 170% in shallow-sea and deep-sea scenarios, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication at IEEE INFOCOM 2026</p></details> |
| **[An accuracy-runtime trade-off comparison of scalable Gaussian process approximations for spatial data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11448v4)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian processes (GPs) are flexible, probabilistic, nonparametric models widely used in fields such as spatial statistics and machine learning. A drawback of Gaussian processes is their computational cost, with $O(N^3)$ time and $O(N^2)$ memory complexity, which makes them prohibitive for large data sets. Numerous approximation techniques have been proposed to address this limitation. In this work, we systematically compare the accuracy of different Gaussian process approximations with respect to likelihood evaluation, parameter estimation, and prediction, explicitly accounting for the computational time required. We analyze the trade-off between accuracy and runtime on multiple simulated and large-scale real-world data sets and find that Vecchia approximations consistently provide the best accuracy-runtime trade-off across most settings considered.</p></details> |  |

Recently, we are witnessing experimental systems research building testbeds that share raw spatial sensor data for cooperative perception. While there has been a marked improvement in accuracies and is the natural way forward, we take a moment to consider the problems with such an approach for eventual adoption by automakers. In this paper, we first argue that new forms of privacy concerns arise and discourage stakeholders to share raw sensor data. Next, we present SHARP, a research framework to minimize privacy leakage and drive stakeholders towards the ambitious goal of raw data based cooperative perception. Finally, we discuss open questions for networked systems, mobile computing, perception researchers, industry and government in realizing our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

However, the scalability and real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale, diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect SpatialVID, a dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes, camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses, depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours of raw videos, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured captions, and serialized motion instructions. Analysis of SpatialVID's data statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly fosters improved model generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video and 3D vision research community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://nju-3dv.github.io/projects/SpatialVID/</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Spatial Reasoning in MLLMs through Programmatic Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16237v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied intelligence, a grand challenge in artificial intelligence, is fundamentally constrained by the limited spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities of current models. Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size. Furthermore, a scalability analysis confirms our hypothesis that overcoming the low-diversity nature of traditional template methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence. We will make the SPRITE framework code and the full 300k+ dataset publicly available to facilitate future research in spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically process spatial and feature views separately, fusing only at output level - an "encode-separately, fuse-late" paradigm that limits multi-scale semantic capture and cross-view interaction. Accordingly, stMFG is proposed, a multi-scale interactive fusion graph network that introduces layer-wise cross-view attention to dynamically integrate spatial and gene features after each convolution. The model combines cross-view contrastive learning with spatial constraints to enhance discriminability while maintaining spatial continuity. On DLPFC and breast cancer datasets, stMFG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 14% ARI improvement on certain slices.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |

Detecting IMBs is difficult due to encoded digital advertisements, frequent changes in personnel and locations, and the reuse of shared infrastructure such as phone numbers and addresses. Traditional approaches, including community tips and regulatory inspections, are largely reactive and ineffective at revealing the broader operational networks traffickers rely on. To address these challenges, we introduce IMBWatch, a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) framework for large-scale IMB detection. IMBWatch constructs dynamic graphs from open-source intelligence, including scraped online advertisements, business license records, and crowdsourced reviews. Nodes represent heterogeneous entities such as businesses, aliases, phone numbers, and locations, while edges capture spatio-temporal and relational patterns, including co-location, repeated phone usage, and synchronized advertising. The framework combines graph convolutional operations with temporal attention mechanisms to model the evolution of IMB networks over time and space, capturing patterns such as intercity worker movement, burner phone rotation, and coordinated advertising surges. Experiments on real-world datasets from multiple U.S. cities show that IMBWatch outperforms baseline models, achieving higher accuracy and F1 scores. Beyond performance gains, IMBWatch offers improved interpretability, providing actionable insights to support proactive and targeted interventions. The framework is scalable, adaptable to other illicit domains, and released with anonymized data and open-source code to support reproducible research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI AISI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Spatio-Temporal Transport: From Rigid Advection to Realistic Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02756v4)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic models for spatio-temporal transport face a critical trade-off between physical realism and interpretability. The advection model with a single constant velocity is interpretable but physically limited by its perfect correlation over time. This work aims to bridge the gap between this simple framework and its physically realistic extensions. Our guiding principle is to introduce a spatial correlation structure that vanishes over time. To achieve this, we present two distinct approaches. The first constructs complex velocity structures, either through superpositions of advection components or by allowing the velocity to vary locally. The second is a spectral technique that replaces the singular spectrum of rigid advection with a more flexible form, introducing temporal decorrelation controlled by parameters. We accompany these models with efficient simulation algorithms and demonstrate their success in replicating complex dynamics, such as tropical cyclones and the solutions of partial differential equations. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of the proposed framework by comparing its simulations to real-world precipitation data from Hurricane Florence.</p></details> |  |

Although advanced Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain: (i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns; and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (AI for Social Impact)</p></details> |

Integrating data from satellite products and ground monitors are increasingly used to produce exposure surfaces. However, spatio-temporal misalignment often induced from missing data introduces substantial uncertainty and reduces predictive accuracy. We propose a Bayesian weighted predictor regression framework that models spatio-temporal relationships when predictors are observed on irregular supports or have substantial missing data, and are not concurrent with the outcome. The key feature of our model is a spatio-temporal kernel that aggregates the predictor over local space-time neighborhoods, built directly into the likelihood, eliminating any separate gap-filling or forced data alignment stage. We introduce a numerical approximation using a Voronoi-based spatial quadrature combined with irregular temporal increments for estimation under data missingness and misalignment. We showed that misspecification of the spatial and temporal lags induced bias in the mean and parameter estimates, indicating the need for principled parameter selection. Simulation studies confirmed these findings, where careful tuning was critical to control bias and achieve accurate prediction, while the proposed quadrature performed well under severe missingness. As an illustrative application, we estimated fine particulate matter (PM$_{2.5}$) in northern California using satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and wildfire smoke plume indicators. Relative to a traditional collocated linear model, our approach improved out-of-sample predictive performance, reduced uncertainty, and yielded robust temporal predictions and spatial surface estimation. Our framework is extensible to additional spatio-temporally varying covariates and other kernel families.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, Updated results section</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking the Spatio-Temporal Alignment of End-to-End 3D Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23635v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal alignment is crucial for temporal modeling of end-to-end (E2E) perception in autonomous driving (AD), providing valuable structural and textural prior information. Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%. When semantics are corrupted (nuScenes-C), the enhancement of motion modeling by HAT enables more robust perception and planning in the E2E AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Long-Term Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of Monthly Rainfall in West Bengal Using Ensemble Learning Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13927v2)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rainfall forecasting plays a critical role in climate adaptation, agriculture, and water resource management. This study develops long-term forecasts of monthly rainfall across 19 districts of West Bengal using a century-scale dataset spanning 1900-2019. Daily rainfall records are aggregated into monthly series, resulting in 120 years of observations for each district. The forecasting task involves predicting the next 108 months (9 years, 2011-2019) while accounting for temporal dependencies and spatial interactions among districts. To address the nonlinear and complex structure of rainfall dynamics, we propose a hierarchical modeling framework that combines regression-based forecasting of yearly features with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for monthly prediction. Yearly features, such as annual totals, quarterly proportions, variability measures, skewness, and extremes, are first forecasted using regression models that incorporate both own lags and neighboring-district lags. These forecasts are then integrated as auxiliary inputs into an MLP model, which captures nonlinear temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in the monthly series. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical regression-MLP architecture provides robust long-term spatio-temporal forecasts, offering valuable insights for agriculture, irrigation planning, and water conservation strategies.</p></details> | 25 pages, 22 figures |

Hence, they are critical components of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. While many existing systems depend on multiple sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam videos presents a more challenging, yet more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate improved spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to enhance state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets (DAD, DoTA and DADA) show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-accident scores than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Access</p></details> |

Although recent approaches model spatial and temporal correlations, they often under-exploit two practical characteristics of real deployments: the sparse spatial distribution of locations and the heterogeneous availability of auxiliary features across locations. To address these challenges, we propose AnchorGK, an Anchor-based Incremental and Stratified Graph Learning framework for inductive spatio-temporal kriging. AnchorGK introduces anchor locations to stratify the data in a principled manner. Anchors are constructed according to feature availability, and strata are then formed around these anchors. This stratification serves two complementary roles. First, it explicitly represents and continuously updates correlations between unobserved regions and surrounding observed locations within a graph learning framework. Second, it enables the systematic use of all available features across strata via an incremental representation mechanism, mitigating feature incompleteness without discarding informative signals. Building on the stratified structure, we design a dual-view graph learning layer that jointly aggregates feature-relevant and location-relevant information, learning stratum-specific representations that support accurate inference under inductive settings. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that AnchorGK consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for spatio-temporal kriging.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DynAttn, an interpretable dynamic-attention forecasting framework for high-dimensional spatio-temporal count processes. DynAttn combines rolling-window estimation, shared elastic-net feature gating, a compact weight-tied self-attention encoder, and a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) likelihood. This architecture produces calibrated multi-horizon forecasts of expected casualties and exceedance probabilities, while retaining transparent diagnostics through feature gates, ablation analysis, and elasticity measures. We evaluate DynAttn using global country-level and high-resolution PRIO-grid-level conflict data from the VIEWS forecasting system, benchmarking it against established statistical and machine-learning approaches, including DynENet, LSTM, Prophet, PatchTST, and the official VIEWS baseline. Across forecast horizons from one to twelve months, DynAttn consistently achieves substantially higher predictive accuracy, with particularly large gains in sparse grid-level settings where competing models often become unstable or degrade sharply. Beyond predictive performance, DynAttn enables structured interpretation of regional conflict dynamics. In our application, cross-regional analyses show that short-run conflict persistence and spatial diffusion form the core predictive backbone, while climate stress acts either as a conditional amplifier or a primary driver depending on the conflict theater.</p></details> |  |

However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.</p></details> |  |

Despite the advances in this field, the complex and stochastic nature of this task still poses challenges to existing approaches. Specifically, deterministic models tend to produce blurry predictions while generative models often struggle with poor accuracy. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective model architecture termed STLDM, a diffusion-based model that learns the latent representation from end to end alongside both the Variational Autoencoder and the conditioning network. STLDM decomposes this task into two stages: a deterministic forecasting stage handled by the conditioning network, and an enhancement stage performed by the latent diffusion model. Experimental results on multiple radar datasets demonstrate that STLDM achieves superior performance compared to the state of the art, while also improving inference efficiency.

We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.</p></details> |  |

Although many existing methods utilize multi-head attention mechanisms and message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture both spatial and temporal relations, these approaches encode temporal and spatial relations independently, and reflect the graph's topological characteristics in a limited manner. In this work, we introduce the Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer), a novel spatio-temporal GNN based on topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks based on MLPs: A temporal block for capturing temporal properties, a message-passing block for encapsulating spatial information, and a cycle message-passing block for enriching topological information through cyclic subgraphs. We bolster the effectiveness of Cy2Mixer with mathematical evidence emphasizing that our cycle message-passing block is capable of offering differentiated information to the deep learning model compared to the message-passing block. Furthermore, empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy of the Cy2Mixer, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances across various spatio-temporal benchmark datasets.

In contrast, many real-world systems including maritime traffic lack such fixed anchors, making the construction of spatio-temporal graphs a fundamental challenge. Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies. We plan to employ two specialized LLM-based agents: \emph{Trajectory Synthesizer} and \emph{Anomaly Injector} to construct richer interaction contexts and generate semantically meaningful anomalies. We expect this benchmark to promote reproducibility and to foster methodological advances in anomaly detection for non-grid spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop in AI for Science: The Reach and Limits of AI for Scientific Discovery</p></details> |

However, current thermal infrared satellite sensors cannot simultaneously achieve high spatial and temporal resolution. Spatio-temporal fusion (STF) techniques address this limitation by combining complementary satellite data, one with high spatial but low temporal resolution, and another with high temporal but low spatial resolution. Existing STF techniques, from classical models to modern deep learning (DL) architectures, were primarily developed for surface reflectance (SR). Their application to thermal data remains limited and often overlooks LST-specific spatial and temporal variability. This study provides a focused review of DL-based STF methods for LST. We present a formal mathematical definition of the thermal fusion task, propose a refined taxonomy of relevant DL methods, and analyze the modifications required when adapting SR-oriented models to LST. To support reproducibility and benchmarking, we introduce a new dataset comprising 51 Terra MODIS-Landsat LST pairs from 2013 to 2024, and evaluate representative models to explore their behavior on thermal data.

| **[DK-STN: A Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network Model for MJO Forecast](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19506v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is fundamental for precipitation forecasting and disaster prevention. To date, long-term and accurate MJO prediction has remained a challenge for researchers. Conventional MJO prediction methods using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and highly unstable (most NWP methods are sensitive to seasons, with better MJO forecast results in winter). While existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods save resources and speed forecasting, their accuracy never reaches the 28 days predicted by the state-of-the-art NWP method, i.e., the operational forecasts from ECMWF, since neural networks cannot handle climate data effectively. In this paper, we present a Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network (DK-STN), a stable neural network model for accurate and efficient MJO forecasting. It combines the benefits of NWP and ANN methods and successfully improves the forecast accuracy of ANN methods while maintaining a high level of efficiency and stability. We begin with a spatial-temporal network (STN) and embed domain knowledge in it using two key methods: (i) applying a domain knowledge enhancement method and (ii) integrating a domain knowledge processing method into network training. We evaluated DK-STN with the 5th generation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and compared it with ECMWF. Given 7 days of climate data as input, DK-STN can generate reliable forecasts for the following 28 days in 1-2 seconds, with an error of only 2-3 days in different seasons. DK-STN significantly exceeds ECMWF in that its forecast accuracy is equivalent to ECMWF's, while its efficiency and stability are significantly superior.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

Automatic and precise detection of behaviorally relevant neuron activity from the recordings is critical to study the mapping of brain activity in organisms. However a perpetual bottleneck to this problem is the manual segmentation which is time and labor intensive and lacks generalizability. To this end, we present a Bayesian Deep Learning Framework to detect neuronal activities in 4D spatio-temporal data obtained by light sheet microscopy. Our approach accounts for the use of temporal information by calculating pixel wise correlation maps and combines it with spatial information given by the mean summary image. The Bayesian framework not only produces probability segmentation maps but also models the uncertainty pertaining to active neuron detection. To evaluate the accuracy of our framework we implemented the test of reproducibility to assert the generalization of the network to detect neuron activity. The network achieved a mean Dice Score of 0.81 relative to the synthetic Ground Truth obtained by Otsu's method and a mean Dice Score of 0.79 between the first and second run for test of reproducibility. Our method successfully deployed can be used for rapid detection of active neuronal activities for behavioural studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Aware Network Based on Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Attention for Action Recognition in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18750v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action recognition is a critical task in video understanding, requiring the comprehensive capture of spatio-temporal cues across various scales. However, existing methods often overlook the multi-granularity nature of actions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Context-Aware Network (CAN). CAN consists of two core modules: the Multi-scale Temporal Cue Module (MTCM) and the Group Spatial Cue Module (GSCM). MTCM effectively extracts temporal cues at multiple scales, capturing both fast-changing motion details and overall action flow. GSCM, on the other hand, extracts spatial cues at different scales by grouping feature maps and applying specialized extraction methods to each group. Experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets (Something-Something V1 and V2, Diving48, Kinetics-400, and UCF101) demonstrate the effectiveness of CAN. Our approach achieves competitive performance, outperforming most mainstream methods, with accuracies of 50.4% on Something-Something V1, 63.9% on Something-Something V2, 88.4% on Diving48, 74.9% on Kinetics-400, and 86.9% on UCF101. These results highlight the importance of capturing multi-scale spatio-temporal cues for robust action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures.

A critical component of disease behavior is the velocity with which disease spreads, defined as the rate of change between time and space. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal modeling approach to determine the velocities of infectious disease spread. Our approach assumes that the locations and times of people infected can be considered as a spatio-temporal point pattern that arises as a realization of a spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox process. The intensity of this process is estimated using fast Bayesian inference by employing the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approaches. The velocity is then calculated using finite differences that approximate the derivatives of the intensity function. Finally, the directions and magnitudes of the velocities can be mapped at specific times to examine better the spread of the disease throughout the region. We demonstrate our method by analyzing COVID-19 spread in Cali, Colombia, during the 2020-2021 pandemic.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 46 figures, Journal American Statistican, submitted on 3rd of September</p></details> |
| **[A Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network for City-Scale Dynamic Logistics Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18441v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>City-scale logistics routing has become increasingly challenging as metropolitan road networks grow to tens of millions of edges and traffic conditions evolve rapidly under high-volume mobility demands. Conventional centralized routing algorithms and monolithic graph neural network (GNN) models suffer from limited scalability, high latency, and poor real-time adaptability, which restricts their effectiveness in large urban logistics systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network (HSTE-GNN) for dynamic routing over ultra-large road networks. The framework partitions the city-scale graph into regional subgraphs processed in parallel across distributed computing nodes, enabling efficient learning of localized traffic dynamics. Within each region, an edge-enhanced spatio-temporal module jointly models node states, dynamic edge attributes, and short-term temporal dependencies. A hierarchical coordination layer further aggregates cross-region representations through an asynchronous parameter-server mechanism, ensuring global routing coherence under high-frequency traffic updates. This distributed hierarchical design balances local responsiveness with global consistency, significantly improving scalability and inference efficiency. Experiments on real-world large-scale traffic datasets from Beijing and New York demonstrate that HSTE-GNN outperforms strong spatio-temporal baselines such as ST-GRAPH, achieving 34.9% lower routing delay, 14.7% lower MAPE, and 11.8% lower RMSE, while improving global route consistency by 7.3%. These results confirm that the proposed framework provides a scalable, adaptive, and efficient solution for next-generation intelligent transportation systems and large-scale logistics platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially-informed transformers: Injecting geostatistical covariance biases into self-attention for spatio-temporal forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17696v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The modeling of high-dimensional spatio-temporal processes presents a fundamental dichotomy between the probabilistic rigor of classical geostatistics and the flexible, high-capacity representations of deep learning. While Gaussian processes offer theoretical consistency and exact uncertainty quantification, their prohibitive computational scaling renders them impractical for massive sensor networks. Conversely, modern transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling but inherently lack a geometric inductive bias, treating spatial sensors as permutation-invariant tokens without a native understanding of distance. In this work, we propose a spatially-informed transformer, a hybrid architecture that injects a geostatistical inductive bias directly into the self-attention mechanism via a learnable covariance kernel. By formally decomposing the attention structure into a stationary physical prior and a non-stationary data-driven residual, we impose a soft topological constraint that favors spatially proximal interactions while retaining the capacity to model complex dynamics. We demonstrate the phenomenon of ``Deep Variography'', where the network successfully recovers the true spatial decay parameters of the underlying process end-to-end via backpropagation. Extensive experiments on synthetic Gaussian random fields and real-world traffic benchmarks confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks. Furthermore, rigorous statistical validation confirms that the proposed method delivers not only superior predictive accuracy but also well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts, effectively bridging the gap between physics-aware modeling and data-driven learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Spatio-Temporal Feature Representations for Video-Based Gaze Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17673v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based gaze estimation methods aim to capture the inherently temporal dynamics of human eye gaze from multiple image frames. However, since models must capture both spatial and temporal relationships, performance is limited by the feature representations within a frame but also between multiple frames. We propose the Spatio-Temporal Gaze Network (ST-Gaze), a model that combines a CNN backbone with dedicated channel attention and self-attention modules to fuse eye and face features optimally. The fused features are then treated as a spatial sequence, allowing for the capture of an intra-frame context, which is then propagated through time to model inter-frame dynamics. We evaluated our method on the EVE dataset and show that ST-Gaze achieves state-of-the-art performance both with and without person-specific adaptation. Additionally, our ablation study provides further insights into the model performance, showing that preserving and modelling intra-frame spatial context with our spatio-temporal recurrence is fundamentally superior to premature spatial pooling. As such, our results pave the way towards more robust video-based gaze estimation using commonly available cameras.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, the code repository is available at https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/u0172623/ST-Gaze</p></details> |
| **[Foundation for unbiased cross-validation of spatio-temporal models for species distribution modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03480v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the predictive performance of species distribution models (SDMs) under realistic deployment scenarios requires careful handling of spatial and temporal dependencies in the data. Cross-validation (CV) is the standard approach for model evaluation, but its design strongly influences the validity of performance estimates. When SDMs are intended for spatial or temporal transfer, random CV can lead to overoptimistic results due to spatial autocorrelation (SAC) among neighboring observations. We benchmark four machine learning algorithms (GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest) on two real-world presence-absence datasets, a temperate plant and an anadromous fish, using multiple CV designs: random, spatial, spatio-temporal, environmental, and forward-chaining. Two training data usage strategies (LAST FOLD and RETRAIN) are evaluated, with hyperparameter tuning performed within each CV scheme. Model performance is assessed on independent out-of-time test sets using AUC, MAE, and correlation metrics. Random CV overestimates AUC by up to 0.16 and produces MAE values up to 80 percent higher than spatially blocked alternatives. Blocking at the empirical SAC range substantially reduces this bias. Training strategy affects evaluation outcomes: LAST FOLD yields smaller validation-test discrepancies under strong SAC, while RETRAIN achieves higher test AUC when SAC is weaker. Boosted ensemble models consistently perform best under spatially structured CV designs. We recommend a robust SDM workflow based on SAC-aware blocking, blocked hyperparameter tuning, and external temporal validation to improve reliability under spatial and temporal shifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted manuscript.

| **[Pattern recognition in complex systems via vector-field representations of spatio-temporal data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16763v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A complex system comprises multiple interacting entities whose interdependencies form a unified whole, exhibiting emergent behaviours not present in individual components. Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |
| **[A Survey on Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16487v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many complex real-world systems exhibit inherently intertwined temporal and spatial characteristics. Spatio-temporal knowledge graphs (STKGs) have therefore emerged as a powerful representation paradigm, as they integrate entities, relationships, time and space within a unified graph structure. They are increasingly applied across diverse domains, including environmental systems and urban, transportation, social and human mobility networks. However, modeling STKGs remains challenging: their foundations span classical graph theory as well as temporal and spatial graph models, which have evolved independently across different research communities and follow heterogeneous modeling assumptions and terminologies. As a result, existing approaches often lack conceptual alignment, generalizability and reusability. This survey provides a systematic review of spatio-temporal knowledge graph models, tracing their origins in static, temporal and spatial graph modeling. We analyze existing approaches along key modeling dimensions, including edge semantics, temporal and spatial annotation strategies, temporal and spatial semantics and relate these choices to their respective application domains. Our analysis reveals that unified modeling frameworks are largely absent and that most current models are tailored to specific use cases rather than designed for reuse or long-term knowledge preservation. Based on these findings, we derive modeling guidelines and identify open challenges to guide future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[SNOW: Spatio-Temporal Scene Understanding with World Knowledge for Open-World Embodied Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16461v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robotic systems require spatio-temporal understanding of dynamic environments to ensure reliable navigation and interaction. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide open-world semantic priors, they lack grounding in 3D geometry and temporal dynamics. Conversely, geometric perception captures structure and motion but remains semantically sparse. We propose SNOW (Scene Understanding with Open-World Knowledge), a training-free and backbone-agnostic framework for unified 4D scene understanding that integrates VLM-derived semantics with point cloud geometry and temporal consistency. SNOW processes synchronized RGB images and 3D point clouds, using HDBSCAN clustering to generate object-level proposals that guide SAM2-based segmentation. Each segmented region is encoded through our proposed Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP), producing multimodal tokens that capture localized semantic, geometric, and temporal attributes. These tokens are incrementally integrated into a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG), which serves as 4D prior for downstream reasoning. A lightweight SLAM backend anchors all STEP tokens spatially in the environment, providing the global reference alignment, and ensuring unambiguous spatial grounding across time. The resulting 4DSG forms a queryable, unified world model through which VLMs can directly interpret spatial scene structure and temporal dynamics. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that SNOW enables precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, thereby setting new state-of-the-art performance in several settings, highlighting the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncovering Alzheimer's Disease Progression via SDE-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Deep Learning on Longitudinal Brain Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21735v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Machine Learning Model for Mortgage Credit Risk: Default Probabilities and Loan Portfolios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02846v3)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel machine learning model for credit risk by combining tree-boosting with a latent spatio-temporal Gaussian process model accounting for frailty correlation. This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[R4: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning for Vision-Language Models in 4D Spatio-Temporal Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15940v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans perceive and reason about their surroundings in four dimensions by building persistent, structured internal representations that encode semantic meaning, spatial layout, and temporal dynamics. These multimodal memories enable them to recall past events, infer unobserved states, and integrate new information into context-dependent reasoning. Inspired by this capability, we introduce R4, a training-free framework for retrieval-augmented reasoning in 4D spatio-temporal space that equips vision-language models (VLMs) with structured, lifelong memory. R4 continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time, yielding a persistent world model that can be shared across agents. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations, which are integrated into the VLM's reasoning. Unlike classical retrieval-augmented generation methods, retrieval in R4 operates directly in 4D space, enabling episodic and collaborative reasoning without training. Experiments on embodied question answering and navigation benchmarks demonstrate that R4 substantially improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines, advancing a new paradigm for embodied 4D reasoning in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a new concept of 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP), which aims to address two tasks: (1) reactive forecasting: ''what will happen next'' and (2) proactive forecasting: "what would happen given a specific future action". For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames). To address this task, we propose OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model that maintains a dense voxel-based scene state and incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context over time. OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation. This design enables online inference and robust performance even when historical sensor input is missing or noisy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the OccSTeP concept and our OccSTeP-WM, yielding an average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain). The data and code will be open source at https://github.com/FaterYU/OccSTeP.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Rigid-Deformation Decomposition AI Framework for 3D Spatio-Temporal Prediction of Vehicle Collision Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19712v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a rigid-deformation decomposition framework for vehicle collision dynamics that mitigates the spectral bias of implicit neural representations, that is, coordinate-based neural networks that directly map spatio-temporal coordinates to physical fields. We introduce a hierarchical architecture that decouples global rigid-body motion from local deformation using two scale-specific networks, denoted as RigidNet and DeformationNet. To enforce kinematic separation between the two components, we adopt a frozen-anchor training strategy combined with a quaternion-incremental scheme. This strategy alleviates the kinematic instability observed in joint training and yields a 29.8% reduction in rigid-body motion error compared with conventional direct prediction schemes. The stable rigid-body anchor improves the resolution of high-frequency structural buckling, which leads to a 17.2% reduction in the total interpolation error. Loss landscape analysis indicates that the decomposition smooths the optimization surface, which enhances robustness to distribution shifts in angular extrapolation and yields a 46.6% reduction in error. To assess physical validity beyond numerical accuracy, we benchmark the decomposed components against an oracle model that represents an upper bound on performance. The proposed framework recovers 92% of the directional correlation between rigid and deformation components and 96% of the spatial deformation localization accuracy relative to the oracle, while tracking the temporal energy dynamics with an 8 ms delay. These results demonstrate that rigid-deformation decomposition enables accurate and physically interpretable predictions for nonlinear collision dynamics.</p></details> | 38 pages, 24 figures |

Despite their potential, research on spatio-temporal knowledge graph question answering (STKGQA) remains limited. This is primarily due to the lack of datasets that simultaneously contain spatio-temporal information, as well as methods capable of handling implicit spatio-temporal reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce the spatio-temporal question answering dataset (STQAD), the first comprehensive benchmark comprising 10,000 natural language questions that require both temporal and spatial reasoning. STQAD is constructed with real-world facts containing spatio-temporal information, ensuring that the dataset reflects practical scenarios. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that existing KGQA methods underperform on STQAD, primarily due to their inability to model spatio-temporal interactions. To address this, we propose the spatio-temporal complex question answering (STCQA) method, which jointly embeds temporal and spatial features into KG representations and dynamically filters answers through constraint-aware reasoning. STCQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Our work not only provides a valuable resource for future research but also advances the field by offering a robust baseline for answering complex spatio-temporal questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 10 figures.

| **[NL2SpaTiaL: Generating Geometric Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications from Natural Language for Manipulation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13670v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Logic (SpaTiaL) offers a principled formalism for expressing geometric spatial requirements-an essential component of robotic manipulation, where object locations, neighborhood relations, pose constraints, and interactions directly determine task success. Yet prior works have largely relied on standard temporal logic (TL), which models only robot trajectories and overlooks object-level interactions. Existing datasets built from randomly generated TL formulas paired with natural-language descriptions therefore cover temporal operators but fail to represent the layered spatial relations that manipulation tasks depend on. To address this gap, we introduce a dataset generation framework that synthesizes SpaTiaL specifications and converts them into natural-language descriptions through a deterministic, semantics-preserving back-translation procedure. This pipeline produces the NL2SpaTiaL dataset, aligning natural language with multi-level spatial relations and temporal objectives to reflect the compositional structure of manipulation tasks. Building on this foundation, we propose a translation-verification framework equipped with a language-based semantic checker that ensures the generated SpaTiaL formulas faithfully encode the semantics specified by the input description. Experiments across a suite of manipulation tasks show that SpaTiaL-based representations yield more interpretable, verifiable, and compositional grounding for instruction following.

Existing 2D speech-to-video diffusion models depend heavily on reference guidance, leading to limited motion diversity. At the same time, 3D-aware animation typically relies on inversion through pre-trained tri-plane generators, which often leads to imperfect reconstructions and identity drift. We rethink reference- and geometry-based paradigms in two ways. First, we deviate from strict reference conditioning at pre-training by introducing softer identity constraints. Second, we address 3D awareness implicitly within the 2D video domain by leveraging the inherent multi-view nature of video data. STARCaster adopts a compositional approach progressing from ID-aware motion modeling, to audio-visual synchronization via lip reading-based supervision, and finally to novel view animation through temporal-to-spatial adaptation. To overcome the scarcity of 4D audio-visual data, we propose a decoupled learning approach in which view consistency and temporal coherence are trained independently. A self-forcing training scheme enables the model to learn from longer temporal contexts than those generated at inference, mitigating the overly static animations common in existing autoregressive approaches. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STARCaster generalizes effectively across tasks and identities, consistently surpassing prior approaches in different benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://foivospar.github.io/STARCaster/</p></details> |

While forecasting models generally disregard unmonitored roads by design, spatial imputation methods explicitly address network-wide estimation; yet this approach relies on volume data at inference time, limiting its applicability in sensor-scarce cities. Unlike traffic volume data, probe vehicle speeds and static road attributes are more broadly accessible and support full coverage of road segments in most urban networks. In this work, we present the Hybrid Directed-Attention Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HDA-STGNN), an inductive deep learning framework designed to tackle the network-wide volume estimation problem. Our approach leverages speed profiles, static road attributes, and road network topology to predict daily traffic volume profiles across all road segments in the network. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform extensive ablation studies that demonstrate the model's capacity to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies and highlight the value of topological information for accurate network-wide traffic volume estimation without relying on volume data at inference time.</p></details> |  |

Our algorithm consists of two branches: spatial processing and time evolution. Regarding the spatial processing, the classical module encodes the local topological features of the road network based on the GCN method, and the quantum module is designed to map graph features onto parameterized quantum circuits through a differentiable pooling layer. The time evolution is solved by integrating multi-source contextual information and capturing dynamic trip dependencies on the classical TCN theory. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the current methods in terms of prediction accuracy and stability, validating the unique advantages of the quantum-enhanced mechanism in capturing high-dimensional spatial dependencies.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods rely solely on the previous frame's features to predict temporal context, leading to two critical issues. First, the short reference window misses long-term dependencies and fine texture details. Second, propagating only feature-level information accumulates errors over frames, causing prediction inaccuracies and loss of subtle textures. To address these, we propose the Long-term Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Context (L-STEC) method. We first extend the reference chain with LSTM to capture long-term dependencies. We then incorporate warped spatial context from the pixel domain, fusing spatio-temporal information through a multi-receptive field network to better preserve reference details. Experimental results show that L-STEC significantly improves compression by enriching contextual information, achieving 37.01% bitrate savings in PSNR and 31.65% in MS-SSIM compared to DCVC-TCM, outperforming both VTM-17.0 and DCVC-FM and establishing new state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Data Compression Conference (DCC) 2026 as an oral paper</p></details> |

Adaptive delayed matching creates a trade-off between matching and pickup delays by deciding whether to assign drivers immediately or batch requests. Since outcomes accumulate over long horizons with stochastic dynamics, reinforcement learning (RL) is a suitable framework. However, existing approaches often oversimplify traffic dynamics or use shallow encoders that miss complex spatiotemporal patterns. We introduce the Regime-Aware Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (RAST-MoE), which formalizes adaptive delayed matching as a regime-aware MDP equipped with a self-attention MoE encoder. Unlike monolithic networks, our experts specialize automatically, improving representation capacity while maintaining computational efficiency. A physics-informed congestion surrogate preserves realistic density-speed feedback, enabling millions of efficient rollouts, while an adaptive reward scheme guards against pathological strategies. With only 12M parameters, our framework outperforms strong baselines. On real-world Uber trajectory data (San Francisco), it improves total reward by over 13%, reducing average matching and pickup delays by 10% and 15% respectively. It demonstrates robustness across unseen demand regimes and stable training. These findings highlight the potential of MoE-enhanced RL for large-scale decision-making with complex spatiotemporal dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[WGAST: Weakly-Supervised Generative Network for Daily 10 m Land Surface Temperature Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06485v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a weakly-supervised generative network for daily 10 m LST estimation via spatio-temporal fusion of Terra MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity, normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.05% and improves SSIM by 4.22%. Furthermore, WGAST effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against near-surface air temperature measurements from 33 near-ground sensors.

In this article, we introduce the R software package deepspat, which allows for modeling, fitting and prediction with nonstationary spatial and spatio-temporal models applied to Gaussian and extremes data. The nonstationary models in our package are constructed using a deep multi-layered deformation of the original spatial or spatio-temporal domain, and are straightforward to implement. Model parameters are estimated using gradient-based optimization of customized loss functions with tensorflow, which implements automatic differentiation. The functionalities of the package are illustrated through simulation studies and an application to Nepal temperature data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Know-Show: Benchmarking Video-Language Models on Spatio-Temporal Grounded Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05513v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Video-Language Models (Video-LMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal understanding, yet their reasoning remains weakly grounded in space and time. We present Know-Show, a new benchmark designed to evaluate spatio-temporal grounded reasoning, the ability of a model to reason about actions and their semantics while simultaneously grounding its inferences in visual and temporal evidence. Know-Show unifies reasoning and localization within a single evaluation framework consisting of five complementary scenarios across spatial (person, object, person-object, and hand-object) and temporal dimensions. Built from Charades, Action Genome, and Ego4D with 2.5K human-authored questions, the benchmark exposes significant gaps between current Video-LMs and human reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose GRAM, a training-free plug-in that augments Video-LMs with fine-grained grounding through attention-based video token selection and explicit timestamp encoding. Extensive experiments across open and closed Video-LMs (Qwen, VideoLLaVA, GPT-4o, and Gemini, etc.) reveal that existing models struggle to "show what they know" and vice versa, especially in fine-grained hand-object interactions. Know-Show establishes a unified standard for assessing grounded reasoning in video-language understanding and provides insights toward developing interpretable and reliable multimodal reasoning systems. We will release the dataset and the code at https://github.com/LUNAProject22/Know-Show.</p></details> |  |
| **[VOST-SGG: VLM-Aided One-Stage Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05524v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal scene graph generation (ST-SGG) aims to model objects and their evolving relationships across video frames, enabling interpretable representations for downstream reasoning tasks such as video captioning and visual question answering. Despite recent advancements in DETR-style single-stage ST-SGG models, they still suffer from several key limitations. First, while these models rely on attention-based learnable queries as a core component, these learnable queries are semantically uninformed and instance-agnostically initialized. Second, these models rely exclusively on unimodal visual features for predicate classification. To address these challenges, we propose VOST-SGG, a VLM-aided one-stage ST-SGG framework that integrates the common sense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) into the ST-SGG pipeline. First, we introduce the dual-source query initialization strategy that disentangles what to attend to from where to attend, enabling semantically grounded what-where reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal feature bank that fuses visual, textual, and spatial cues derived from VLMs for improved predicate classification. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VLM-aided semantic priors and multi-modal features for ST-SGG. We will release the code at https://github.com/LUNAProject22/VOST.</p></details> |  |
| **[1 + 1 > 2: Detector-Empowered Video Large Language Model for Spatio-Temporal Grounding and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06673v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal grounding and reasoning aims to locate the temporal segment and spatial region of an event in a video given a user query, while also reasoning about semantics such as causality, temporal order, and action relationships. To achieve this, current MLLMs primarily treats bounding boxes as text tokens and generates them autoregressively. However, such autoregressive spatial decoding leads to very-long output sequences, causing spatial errors to accumulated over time and the localization results to progressively drift across a video. To address this, we present a Detector-Empowered Video LLM, short for DEViL, which couples a Video LLM with an open-vocabulary detector (OVD). Specifically, the MLLM and detector are connected via a reference-semantic token (RST) that distills the user query into a rich semantic representation. Unlike tokens that merely serve as spatial prompts or segmentor switches, the RST functions as both a control signal and a replacement for the OVD's text embedding, enabling end-to-end learning of both referential understanding and spatial localization. Furthermore, we propose a tube-mined temporal regularization (TTReg) within OVD, which drives the OVD to generate temporally-consistent queries for target objects, thereby ensuring effective temporal association. Experiments demonstrate that DEViL achieves strong performance across various fine-grained video understanding tasks, particularly STVG and GroundedVQA. Code will be released on https://github.com/gaostar123/DeViL.</p></details> |  |

| **[Echo-E$^3$Net: Efficient Endocardial Spatio-Temporal Network for Ejection Fraction Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17543v2)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a key indicator of cardiac function and is routinely used to diagnose heart failure and guide treatment decisions. Although deep learning has advanced automated LVEF estimation, many existing approaches are computationally demanding and underutilize the joint structure of spatial and temporal information in echocardiography videos, limiting their suitability for real-time clinical deployment. We propose Echo-E$^3$Net, an efficient endocardial spatio-temporal network specifically designed for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos. Echo-E$^3$Net comprises two complementary modules: (1) a dual-phase Endocardial Border Detector (E$^2$CBD), which uses phase-specific cross-attention to predict ED/ES endocardial landmarks (EBs) and learn phase-aware landmark embeddings (LEs), and (2) an Endocardial Feature Aggregator (E$^2$FA), which fuses these embeddings with global statistical descriptors (mean, maximum, variance) of deep feature maps to refine EF regression. A multi-component loss function, inspired by Simpson's biplane method, jointly supervises EF, volumes, and landmark geometry, thereby aligning optimization with the clinical definition of LVEF and promoting robust spatio-temporal representation learning. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, Echo-E$^3$Net achieves an RMSE of 5.20 and an $R^2$ score of 0.82, while using only 1.54M parameters and 8.05 GFLOPs. The model operates without external pre-training, heavy data augmentation, or test-time ensembling, making it highly suitable for real-time point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications.

| **[Spatio-temporal Shared-Field Modeling of Beluga and Bowhead Whale Sightings Using a Joint Marked Log-Gaussian Cox Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06450v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze a decade of aerial survey whale sighting data (2010-2019) to model the spatio-temporal distributions and group sizes of beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) and bowhead (Balaena mysticetus) whales in the United States Arctic. To jointly model these species, we develop a multi-species Log-Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP) in which species specific intensity surfaces are linked through a shared latent spatial Gaussian field. This structure allows the model to capture broad spatial patterns common to both species while still accommodating species level responses to environmental covariates and seasonal variation. The latent field is represented using the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach with an anisotropic Matern covariance, implemented on an ocean constrained triangulated mesh so that spatial dependence aligns with marine geography. Whale group size is incorporated through a marked point process extension with species specific negative binomial marks, allowing occurrence and group sizes to be jointly analyzed within a unified framework. Inference is carried out using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), enabling efficient model fitting over a decade of survey effort. The results highlight persistent multi-species hotspots and distinct environmental associations for each species, demonstrating the value of shared field LGCPs for joint species distribution modeling in data sparse and heterogeneous survey settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Spatio-temporal Extremes via Conditional Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06348v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme weather events are widely studied in fields such as agriculture, ecology, and meteorology. The spatio-temporal co-occurrence of extreme events can strengthen or weaken under changing climate conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model spatio-temporal extremes by integrating climate indices via a conditional variational autoencoder (cXVAE). A convolutional neural network (CNN) is embedded in the decoder to convolve climatological indices with the spatial dependence within the latent space, thereby allowing the decoder to be dependent on the climate variables. There are three main contributions here. First, we demonstrate through extensive simulations that the proposed conditional XVAE accurately emulates spatial fields and recovers spatially and temporally varying extremal dependence with very low computational cost post training. Second, we provide a simple, scalable approach to detecting condition-driven shifts and whether the dependence structure is invariant to the conditioning variable. Third, when dependence is found to be condition-sensitive, the conditional XVAE supports counterfactual experiments allowing intervention on the climate covariate and propagating the associated change through the learned decoder to quantify differences in joint tail risk, co-occurrence ranges, and return metrics. To demonstrate the practical utility and performance of the model in real-world scenarios, we apply our method to analyze the monthly maximum Fire Weather Index (FWI) over eastern Australia from 2014 to 2024 conditioned on the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOAP: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Relation and Motion Information Capturing for Few-Shot Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16344v5)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

Deploying portable sensors on mobile platforms such as cars and buses offers a low-cost, easy-to-maintain, and wide-coverage data collection solution. However, due to the random and uncontrollable movement patterns of these non-dedicated mobile platforms, the resulting sensor data are often incomplete and temporally inconsistent. By exploring potential training patterns in the reverse process of diffusion models, we propose Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (STeP-Diff). STeP-Diff leverages DeepONet to model the spatial sequence of measurements along with a PDE-informed diffusion model to forecast the spatio-temporal field from incomplete and time-varying data. Through a PDE-constrained regularization framework, the denoising process asymptotically converges to the convection-diffusion dynamics, ensuring that predictions are both grounded in real-world measurements and aligned with the fundamental physics governing pollution dispersion. To assess the performance of the system, we deployed 59 self-designed portable sensing devices in two cities, operating for 14 days to collect air pollution data. Compared to the second-best performing algorithm, our model achieved improvements of up to 89.12% in MAE, 82.30% in RMSE, and 25.00% in MAPE, with extensive evaluations demonstrating that STeP-Diff effectively captures the spatio-temporal dependencies in air pollution fields.</p></details> |  |

We propose a decay-adjusted spatio-temporal (DAST) model that explicitly accounts for the time-varying impact of MDA on NTD prevalence, providing a flexible and interpretable framework for estimating intervention effects from sparse survey data. Using case studies on soil-transmitted helminths and lymphatic filariasis, we show that DAST offers a practical alternative to standard geostatistical models when the objective includes quantifying MDA impact and supporting short-term programmatic forecasting. We also discuss extensions and identifiability challenges, advocating for data-driven parsimony over complexity in settings where the available data are too sparse to support the estimation of highly parameterised models.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[ToG-Bench: Task-Oriented Spatio-Temporal Grounding in Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03666v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core capability towards general embodied intelligence lies in localizing task-relevant objects from an egocentric perspective, formulated as Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG). Despite recent progress, existing STVG studies remain largely confined to object-centric and descriptive instructions, neglecting the task-oriented reasoning that is crucial for embodied agents to accomplish goal-directed interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{ToG-Bench}, the first task-oriented spatio-temporal video grounding benchmark for egocentric videos. ToG-Bench is characterized by three key features: (1) \textbf{Task-oriented Grounding}, which requires identifying and localizing objects based on intended tasks rather than straightforward descriptions; (2) \textbf{Explicit-Implicit Dual Grounding}, where target objects can be either explicitly mentioned or implicitly inferred by contextual reasoning; (3) \textbf{One-to-Many Grounding}, where a single instruction may correspond to multiple objects involved in task execution. Built upon videos sourced from ScanNet, ToG-Bench comprises 100 annotated clips with 2,704 task-oriented grounding instructions, constructed via a semi-automated pipeline that combines foundation model annotation and human refinement. In addition, we introduce a set of task-level evaluation metrics tailored for multi-object and explicit-implicit object grounding, and systematically benchmark seven state-of-the-art MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal the intrinsic challenges of task-oriented STVG and substantial performance gaps across explicit-implicit and multi-object grounding, highlighting the difficulty of bridging perception and interaction in embodied scenarios.

Therefore, it is imperative to develop a robust spatio-temporal learning methodology capable of extracting meaningful insights from incomplete datasets. Despite the existence of methodologies for spatio-temporal graph forecasting in the presence of missing values, unresolved issues persist. Primarily, the majority of extant research is predicated on time-series analysis, thereby neglecting the dynamic spatial correlations inherent in sensor networks. Additionally, the complexity of missing data patterns compounds the intricacy of the problem. Furthermore, the variability in maintenance conditions results in a significant fluctuation in the ratio and pattern of missing values, thereby challenging the generalizability of predictive models. In response to these challenges, this study introduces GeoMAE, a self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning model. The model is comprised of three principal components: an input preprocessing module, an attention-based spatio-temporal forecasting network (STAFN), and an auxiliary learning task, which draws inspiration from Masking AutoEncoders to enhance the robustness of spatio-temporal representation learning. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that GeoMAE significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, achieving up to 13.20\% relative improvement over the best baseline models.</p></details> | 34 pages |

| **[Beyond Scaffold: A Unified Spatio-Temporal Gradient Tracking Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01732v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In distributed and federated learning algorithms, communication overhead is often reduced by performing multiple local updates between communication rounds. However, due to data heterogeneity across nodes and the local gradient noise within each node, this strategy can lead to the drift of local models away from the global optimum. To address this issue, we revisit the well-known federated learning method Scaffold (Karimireddy et al., 2020) under a gradient tracking perspective, and propose a unified spatio-temporal gradient tracking algorithm, termed ST-GT, for distributed stochastic optimization over time-varying graphs. ST-GT tracks the global gradient across neighboring nodes to mitigate data heterogeneity, while maintaining a running average of local gradients to substantially suppress noise, with slightly more storage overhead. Without assuming bounded data heterogeneity, we prove that ST-GT attains a linear convergence rate for strongly convex problems and a sublinear rate for nonconvex cases. Notably, ST-GT achieves the first linear speed-up in communication complexity with respect to the number of local updates per round $τ$ for the strongly-convex setting. Compared to traditional gradient tracking methods, ST-GT reduces the topology-dependent noise term from $σ^2$ to $σ^2/τ$, where $σ^2$ denotes the noise level, thereby improving communication efficiency.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Accurate predictive models require high-resolution spatio-temporal data to capture complex dynamics of environmental and human factors. To address the scarcity of fine-grained wildfire datasets in Spain, we introduce IberFire: a spatio-temporal dataset with 1 km x 1 km x 1-day resolution, covering mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands from December 2007 to December 2024.

| **[The Dynamical Model Representation of Convolution-Generated Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Processes and Its Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01279v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolution-generated space-time models yield an important class of non-separable stationary Gaussian Processes (GP) through a sequence of convolution operations, in both space and time, on spatially correlated Brownian motion with a Gaussian convolution kernel. Because of its solid connection to stochastic partial differential equations, such a modeling approach offers strong physical interpretations when it is applied to scientific and engineering processes. In this paper, we obtain a new dynamical model representation for convolution-generated spatio-temporal GP. In particular, an infinite-dimensional linear state-space representation is firstly obtained where the state transition is governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) whose solution has the same space-time covariance as the original convolution-generated process. Then, using the Galerkin's method, a finite-dimension approximation to the infinite-dimensional SDE is obtained, yielding a dynamical model with finite states that facilitates the computation and parameter estimation. The space-time covariance of the approximated dynamical model is obtained, and the error between the approximate and exact covariance matrices is quantified. We investigate the performance of the proposed model through a simulation-based study, and apply the approach to a real case study utilizing the remote-sensing aerosol data during the recent 2025 Los Angeles wildfire. The modeling capability of the proposed approach has been well demonstrated, and the proposed approach is found particularly effective in monitoring the first-order time derivative of the underlying space-time process, making it a good candidate for process modeling, monitoring and anomaly detection problems. Computer code and data have been made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Spatio-Temporal Forecasting Trade-offs Between Graph Neural Networks and Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05179v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems.

Recently, transformer models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, traditional transformers discretize spatio-temporal dimensions, limiting their ability to model continuous dynamical weather processes. Moreover, their reliance on increased depth to capture complex dependencies results in higher computational cost and parameter redundancy. We address these issues with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT integrates a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) for global spatial operators with a transformer parameterised Neural ODE for continuous-time dynamics, yielding a space-time continuous model for weather forecasting. Our proposed method achieves competitive forecasting performance even with a shallow, single-layer transformer encoder mitigating the reliance on deeper networks. STC-ViT generates complete forecast trajectories with an inference speed of only 0.125 seconds and achieves strong medium-range forecasting skill on 1.5-degree WeatherBench 2 as compared to state-of-the-art data-driven and NWP models trained on higher-resolution data, with substantially lower data and compute costs. We also provide detailed empirical analysis on model's performance with respect to denser time grids, higher-accuracy ODE solvers, and deeper transformer stacks.</p></details> |  |

We formalize audio 4D intelligence that is defined as reasoning over sound dynamics in time and 3D space, and introduce STAR-Bench to measure it. STAR-Bench combines a Foundational Acoustic Perception setting (six attributes under absolute and relative regimes) with a Holistic Spatio-Temporal Reasoning setting that includes segment reordering for continuous and discrete processes and spatial tasks spanning static localization, multi-source relations, and dynamic trajectories. Our data curation pipeline uses two methods to ensure high-quality samples. For foundational tasks, we use procedurally synthesized and physics-simulated audio. For holistic data, we follow a four-stage process that includes human annotation and final selection based on human performance. Unlike prior benchmarks where caption-only answering reduces accuracy slightly, STAR-Bench induces far larger drops (-31.5\% temporal, -35.2\% spatial), evidencing its focus on linguistically hard-to-describe cues. Evaluating 19 models reveals substantial gaps compared with humans and a capability hierarchy: closed-source models are bottlenecked by fine-grained perception, while open-source models lag across perception, knowledge, and reasoning. Our STAR-Bench provides critical insights and a clear path forward for developing future models with a more robust understanding of the physical world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://internlm.github.io/StarBench/</p></details> |
| **[Mapping Urban Air Quality from Mobile Sensors Using Spatio-Temporal Geostatistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22544v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of technology and the arrival of miniaturized environmental sensors that offer greater performance, the idea of building mobile network sensing for air quality has quickly emerged to increase our knowledge of air pollution in urban environments. However, with these new techniques, the difficulty of building mathematical models capable of aggregating all these data sources in order to provide precise mapping of air quality arises. In this context, we explore the spatio-temporal geostatistics methods as a solution for such a problem and evaluate three different methods: Simple Kriging (SK) in residuals, Ordinary Kriging (OK), and Kriging with External Drift (KED). On average, geostatistical models showed 26.57% improvement in the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) compared to the standard Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) technique in interpolating scenarios (27.94% for KED, 26.05% for OK, and 25.71% for SK). The results showed less significant scores in extrapolating scenarios (a 12.22% decrease in the RMSE for geostatisical models compared to IDW). We conclude that univariable geostatistics is suitable for interpolating this type of data but is less appropriate for an extrapolation of non-sampled places since it does not create any information.</p></details> |  |

A three-level hierarchical model is proposed to simultaneously accounts for the physical process of interest and measurement errors inherent in low-cost sensors. Several innovative configurations of Vecchia's approximation are investigated, including variations in ordering strategies, distance definitions, and sensor-specific conditioning. These configurations are evaluated for approximating the likelihood of a spatio-temporal Gaussian process, using simulated data based on real mobile sensor trajectories across Nantes, France. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of the min-max distance algorithm for ordering, reaffirming existing literature. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of a random ordering approach that doesn't require prior definition of a spatio-temporal distance. These two ordering configurations achieved, on average, 102\% better results in log Kullback-Leibler divergence compared with four other ordering schemes studied. Results are supplemented with Asymptotic Relative Efficiency analysis, offering practical recommendations for optimizing parameter estimation. The proposed model and preferred Vecchia configuration are applied to real-world air quality data collected using mobile and fixed low-cost sensors. This application underscores the model's practical value for pollution mapping and prediction in environmental monitoring. This study advances the use of Vecchia's approximation for addressing computational challenges of Gaussian models in large-scale spatio-temporal datasets from environmental monitoring with low-cost sensor networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Hierarchical Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20558v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abundance of fine-grained spatio-temporal data, such as traffic sensor networks, offers vast opportunities for scientific discovery. However, inferring causal relationships from such observational data remains challenging, particularly due to unobserved confounders that are specific to units (e.g., geographical locations) yet influence outcomes over time. Most existing methods for spatio-temporal causal inference assume that all confounders are observed, an assumption that is often violated in practice. In this paper, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Hierarchical Causal Models (ST-HCMs), a novel graphical framework that extends hierarchical causal modeling to the spatio-temporal domain. At the core of our approach is the Spatio-Temporal Collapse Theorem, which shows that a complex ST-HCM converges to a simpler flat causal model as the amount of subunit data increases. This theoretical result enables a general procedure for causal identification, allowing ST-HCMs to recover causal effects even in the presence of unobserved, time-invariant unit-level confounders, a scenario where standard non-hierarchical models fail. We validate the effectiveness of our framework on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its potential for robust causal inference in complex dynamic systems.</p></details> |  |

However, current research focuses on simple video scenarios, failing to reflect the complex and diverse nature of real-world audio-visual events in videos. To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, R-AVST is the first dataset designed for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero offers a novel perspective for tackling future challenges in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026.

| **[Multivariate Spatio-temporal Modelling for Completing Cancer Registries and Forecasting Incidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21714v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer data, particularly cancer incidence and mortality, are fundamental to understand the cancer burden, to set targets for cancer control and to evaluate the evolution of the implementation of a cancer control policy. However, the complexity of data collection, classification, validation and processing result in cancer incidence figures often lagging two to three years behind the calendar year. In response, national or regional population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) are increasingly interested in methods for forecasting cancer incidence. However, in many countries there is an additional difficulty in projecting cancer incidence as regional registries are usually not established in the same year and therefore cancer incidence data series between different regions of a country are not harmonised over time. This study addresses the challenge of forecasting cancer incidence with incomplete data at both regional and national levels. To achieve this, we propose the use of multivariate spatio-temporal shared component models that jointly model mortality data and available cancer incidence data. We evaluate the performance of these multivariate models using lung cancer incidence data and the corresponding number of deaths reported in England for the period 2001-2019. Model performance was assessed using different predictive measures to select the best model.</p></details> | 37 pages |
| **[Thinking With Bounding Boxes: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding via Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21375v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) requires localizing a target object in untrimmed videos both temporally and spatially from natural language descriptions. Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Expert Knowledge and Recursive Bayesian Inference: A Framework for Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Data Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00221v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating heterogeneous data sources and expert knowledge is essential for overcoming data scarcity and enhancing estimation accuracy. Two main frameworks naturally arise to perform the integration of these multiple sources: sequential Bayesian inference and integrated models. The first one consists of updating posterior information in a sequential data analysis procedure, without the need to reanalyze previous data when new data become available. The second one consists of bringing together diverse sources of information in a joint inferential analysis through hierarchical Bayesian models. Within the context of the first framework, we propose a recursive inference method grounded in the methodological principles of INLA, designed to handle spatial and spatio-temporal problems, although its applicability is not limited to these cases, as the procedure is general in nature. Within the integrated models framework, we also present a comprehensive approach to address change of support issues that arise when combining heterogeneous information sources, developing a typology that classifies such changes as spatial, temporal, spatio-temporal, or categorical. Both frameworks can be combined, as there is neither a theoretical nor a practical incompatibility preventing their joint use. Finally, detailed examples are provided to illustrate clear and replicable procedures for combining heterogeneous data sources with change of support and recursive inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages and 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[TaCo: Capturing Spatio-Temporal Semantic Consistency in Remote Sensing Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20306v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes across bi-temporal satellite images. Most previous methods rely solely on mask supervision, which effectively guides spatial localization but provides limited constraints on the temporal semantic transitions. Consequently, they often produce spatially coherent predictions while still suffering from unresolved semantic inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose TaCo, a spatio-temporal semantic consistent network, which enriches the existing mask-supervised framework with a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint. TaCo conceptualizes change as a semantic transition between bi-temporal states, in which one temporal feature representation can be derived from the other via dedicated transition features. To realize this, we introduce a Text-guided Transition Generator that integrates textual semantics with bi-temporal visual features to construct the cross-temporal transition features. In addition, we propose a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint consisting of bi-temporal reconstruct constraints and a transition constraint: the former enforces alignment between reconstructed and original features, while the latter enhances discrimination for changes. This design can yield substantial performance gains without introducing any additional computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments on six public datasets, spanning both binary and semantic change detection tasks, demonstrate that TaCo consistently achieves SOTA performance.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the success of FMs, particularly large language models, researchers have recently begun to explore spatio-temporal foundation models (STFMs) to improve adaptability and generalization across a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal (ST) tasks. Despite rapid progress, a systematic investigation of trajectory foundation models (TFMs), a crucial subclass of STFMs, is largely lacking. This tutorial addresses this gap by offering a comprehensive overview of recent advances in TFMs, including a taxonomy of existing methodologies and a critical analysis of their strengths and limitations.

| **[STAlloc: Enhancing Memory Efficiency in Large-Scale Model Training with Spatio-Temporal Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16274v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Such fragmentation stems from the use of online GPU memory allocators in popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, which disregard tensor lifespans. As a result, this inefficiency can waste as much as 43% of memory and trigger out-of-memory errors, undermining the effectiveness of optimization methods. To address this, we introduce STAlloc, a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads. STAlloc introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a pluggable PyTorch memory allocator, STAlloc reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 85.1% (up to 100%) across both dense and MoE models, with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and improves throughput performance by up to 32.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with Adaptive Risk-Aware Decision for Forward Collision Warning in Complex Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19952v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forward Collision Warning systems are crucial for vehicle safety and autonomous driving, yet current methods often fail to balance precise multi-agent interaction modeling with real-time decision adaptability, evidenced by the high computational cost for edge deployment and the unreliability stemming from simplified interaction models.To overcome these dual challenges-computational complexity and modeling insufficiency-along with the high false alarm rates of traditional static-threshold warnings, this paper introduces an integrated FCW framework that pairs a Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with a Dynamic Risk Threshold Adjustment algorithm. HSTAN employs a decoupled architecture (Graph Attention Network for spatial, cascaded GRU with self-attention for temporal) to achieve superior performance and efficiency, requiring only 12.3 ms inference time (73% faster than Transformer methods) and reducing the Average Displacement Error (ADE) to 0.73m (42.2% better than Social_LSTM) on the NGSIM dataset. Furthermore, Conformalized Quantile Regression enhances reliability by generating prediction intervals (91.3% coverage at 90% confidence), which the DTRA module then converts into timely warnings via a physics-informed risk potential function and an adaptive threshold mechanism inspired by statistical process control.Tested across multi-scenario datasets, the complete system demonstrates high efficacy, achieving an F1 score of 0.912, a low false alarm rate of 8.2%, and an ample warning lead time of 2.8 seconds, validating the framework's superior performance and practical deployment feasibility in complex environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[EventSTU: Event-Guided Efficient Spatio-Temporal Understanding for Video Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18920v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video large language models have demonstrated strong video understanding capabilities but suffer from high inference costs due to the massive number of tokens in long videos. Inspired by event-based vision, we propose an event-guided, training-free framework for efficient spatio-temporal understanding, named EventSTU. In the temporal domain, we design a coarse-to-fine keyframe sampling algorithm that exploits the change-triggered property of event cameras to eliminate redundant frames. In the spatial domain, we design an adaptive token pruning algorithm that leverages the visual saliency of events as a zero-cost prior to guide spatial reduction. From a holistic spatio-temporal perspective, we further integrate question relevance from keyframe sampling to adaptively allocate token pruning budgets. To facilitate evaluation, we construct EventBench, the first event-inclusive, human-annotated multimodal benchmark that covers diverse real-world scenarios. Beyond physical event cameras, EventSTU also supports general video understanding using simulated events. Comprehensive experiments show that EventSTU achieves 3.01x FLOPs reduction and 3.10x prefilling speedup over the strongest baseline while still improving performance.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Fusing Biomechanical and Spatio-Temporal Features for Fall Prediction: Characterizing and Mitigating the Simulation-to-Reality Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14620v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Falls are a leading cause of injury and loss of independence among older adults. Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as 'intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation. Our findings underscore the urgent need to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpotFormer: Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Facial Expression Spotting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20799v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial expression spotting, identifying periods where facial expressions occur in a video, is a significant yet challenging task in facial expression analysis. The issues of irrelevant facial movements and the challenge of detecting subtle motions in micro-expressions remain unresolved, hindering accurate expression spotting. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for facial expression spotting. First, we propose a Sliding Window-based multi-temporal-resolution Optical flow (SW-MRO) feature, which calculates multi-temporal-resolution optical flow of the input image sequence within compact sliding windows. The window length is tailored to perceive complete micro-expressions and distinguish between general macro- and micro-expressions. SW-MRO can effectively reveal subtle motions while avoiding the optical flow being dominated by head movements. Second, we propose SpotFormer, a multi-scale spatio-temporal Transformer that simultaneously encodes spatio-temporal relationships of the SW-MRO features for accurate frame-level probability estimation. In SpotFormer, we use the proposed Facial Local Graph Pooling (FLGP) operation and convolutional layers to extract multi-scale spatio-temporal features. We show the validity of the architecture of SpotFormer by comparing it with several model variants. Third, we introduce supervised contrastive learning into SpotFormer to enhance the discriminability between different types of expressions. Extensive experiments on SAMM-LV, CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in micro-expression spotting.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models, a significant gap remains between current models and real-world demands involving diverse objects and complex queries. We attribute this to limited benchmark scope, causing models to exhibit category bias, oversimplified reasoning, and poor linguistic robustness. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniGround, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,475 videos spanning 81 categories and complex real-world queries. We propose the Forward-Backward-Refinement annotation pipeline that combines multi-directional tracking with intelligent error correction for high-quality labels. We further introduce DeepSTG, a systematic evaluation framework quantifying dataset quality across four complementary dimensions beyond superficial statistics. Evaluations reveal performance average drop of 10.4% on complex real-world scenes, particularly with small/occluded objects and intricate spatial relations. Motivated by these, we propose PG-TAF, a training-free two-stage framework decomposing STVG into high-level temporal grounding and fine-grained spatio-temporal propagation. Experiments demonstrate PG-TAF achieves 25.6% and 35.6% improvements in m\_tIoU and m\_vIoU on OmniGround with consistent gains across four benchmarks.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Advances in modern technology have increased the number of available information for this type of data hence the rise of multidimensional data. In this paper we take advantage of the multidimensional structure of the data but also its temporal and spatial structure. In fact, we will be using the NCAR Climate Data Gateway website which provides data discovery and access services for global and regional climate model data. The daily values of total precipitation (prec), maximum (tmax), and minimum (tmin) temperature are combined to create a multidimensional data called tensor (a multidimensional array). In this paper, we propose a spatio temporal principal component analysis to initialize CP decomposition component. We take full advantage of the spatial and temporal structure of the data in the initialization step for cp component analysis. The performance of our method is tested via comparison with most popular initialization method. We also run a clustering analysis to further show the performance of our analysis.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |

These models produce embeddings that can be used as analysis-ready datasets, enabling the modelling of ecosystem dynamics without extensive sensor-specific preprocessing. However, existing models typically operate at fixed spatial or temporal scales, limiting their use for ecological analyses that require both fine spatial detail and high temporal fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a representation learning framework that integrates different EO modalities into a unified feature space at high spatio-temporal resolution. We introduce the framework using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data as representative modalities. Our approach produces a latent space at native 10 m resolution and the temporal frequency of cloud-free Sentinel-2 acquisitions. Each sensor is first modeled independently to capture its sensor-specific characteristics. Their representations are then combined into a shared model. This two-stage design enables modality-specific optimisation and easy extension to new sensors, retaining pretrained encoders while retraining only fusion layers. This enables the model to capture complementary remote sensing data and to preserve coherence across space and time. Qualitative analyses reveal that the learned embeddings exhibit high spatial and semantic consistency across heterogeneous landscapes. Quantitative evaluation in modelling Gross Primary Production reveals that they encode ecologically meaningful patterns and retain sufficient temporal fidelity to support fine-scale analyses. Overall, the proposed framework provides a flexible, analysis-ready representation learning approach for environmental applications requiring diverse spatial and temporal resolutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (incliding 2 pages of references), 7 figures</p></details> |

This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction. TubeRMC outperforms existing methods on two public benchmarks VidSTG and HCSTVG. Further visualization shows that TubeRMC effectively mitigates both target identification errors and inconsistent tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Statisticians and others have long been interested in this problem, which has led to several practical and innovative solutions dating back decades. In this overview, we focus on the problem of data-driven prediction and inference of dynamic spatio-temporal processes that include mechanistic information, such as would be available from partial differential equations, with a strong focus on the quantification of uncertainty associated with data, process, and parameters. We give a brief review of several paradigms and focus our attention on Bayesian implementations given they naturally accommodate uncertainty quantification. We then show that it is straight-forward to include the Bayesian PINN (B-PINN) within the Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) framework that has long been considered for modeling dynamic spatio-temporal processes. Such a BHM-PINN is illustrated via a simulation study in which a latent nonlinear Burgers' equation PDE governs the dynamics of Poisson distributed spatio-temporal data.</p></details> |  |

A latent Gaussian field with a Matérn-SPDE prior provides a continuous space representation, while source-specific observation operators map observations to both point measurements and gridded averages, addressing change-of-support and covariate misalignment. Additionally incorporating temporal dependence enables prediction at unknown locations and time points. Inference and prediction are performed using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations approach, which delivers fast computation with uncertainty quantification. Our contributions are: a hierarchical model that jointly fuses multiple data sources of the same variable under different spatial and temporal resolutions and measurement errors, and a practical implementation that incorporates misaligned covariates via the same data fusion framework allowing differing covariate supports. We demonstrate the utility of this framework via simulations calibrated to realistic sensor densities and spatial coverage. Using the simulation framework, we explore the stability and performance of the approach with respect to the number of time points and data/covariate availability, demonstrating gains over single-source models through point and gridded data fusion. We apply our framework to soil moisture mapping in the Elliot Water catchment (Angus, Scotland). We fuse in-situ sensor data with aligned and misaligned covariates, satellite data and elevation data to produce daily high resolution maps with uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

These processes are able to handle complex interrelationships between stochastic and deterministic components of spatio-temporal phenomena. However, despite its widespread use in practice, there is no common and unified formalism and every paper proposes different views of these stochastic mechanisms. With this in mind, we implement two simulation techniques and three unified, self-consistent inference techniques, which are widely used in the practical modeling of spatio-temporal Hawkes processes. Furthermore, we provide an evaluation of the practical performance of these methods, while providing useful code for reproducibility.</p></details> |  |

Each mixture component models possessions as marked spatio-temporal point processes: event types follow a finite Markov chain with an absorbing state for ball loss, event times follow a conditional Gamma process to account for dispersion, and spatial locations evolve via truncated Brownian motion. To aid interpretation, we derive summary indicators from model parameters capturing possession speed, number of events, and spatial dynamics. Parameters are estimated through maximum likelihood via Generalized Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Applied to StatsBomb data from 38 Ligue 1 matches (2020/2021), our approach uncovers distinct defensive possession patterns faced by Stade Rennais. Unlike previous approaches focusing on individual events, our mixture structure enables principled clustering of full possessions, supporting tactical analysis and the future development of realistic virtual training environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAST: A Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal Network for Traffic Time Series Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13414v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic time series imputation is crucial for the safety and reliability of intelligent transportation systems, while diverse types of missing data, including random, fiber, and block missing make the imputation task challenging. Existing models often focus on disentangling and separately modeling spatial and temporal patterns based on relationships between data points. However, these approaches struggle to adapt to the random missing positions, and fail to learn long-term and large-scale dependencies, which are essential in extensive missing conditions. In this paper, patterns are categorized into two types to handle various missing data conditions: primary patterns, which originate from internal relationships between data points, and auxiliary patterns, influenced by external factors like timestamps and node attributes. Accordingly, we propose the Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal network (PAST). It comprises a graph-integrated module (GIM) and a cross-gated module (CGM). GIM captures primary patterns via dynamic graphs with interval-aware dropout and multi-order convolutions, and CGM extracts auxiliary patterns through bidirectional gating on embedded external features. The two modules interact via shared hidden vectors and are trained under an ensemble self-supervised framework. Experiments on three datasets under 27 missing data conditions demonstrate that the imputation accuracy of PAST outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines by up to 26.2% in RMSE and 31.6% in MAE.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we extend classical mixed effect regression models by introducing a space-time nonparametric component, regularized through a partial differential equation, to embed the physical dynamics of the underlying process, while random effects capture latent variability associated with the group structure present in the data. We propose a two-step procedure to estimate the fixed and random components of the model, relying on a functional version of the Iterative Reweighted Least Squares algorithm. We investigate the asymptotic properties of both fixed and random components, and we assess the performance of the proposed model through a simulation study, comparing it with state-of-the-art alternatives from the literature. The proposed methodology is finally applied to the study of hourly nitrogen dioxide concentration data in Lombardy (Italy), using random effects to account for measurement heterogeneity across monitoring stations equipped with different sensor technologies.</p></details> |  |

This failure occurs because GNNs are fundamentally correlational models, learning historical patterns that are invalidated by the new causal factors introduced during disruptions. To address this, we propose Event-CausNet, a framework that uses a Large Language Model to quantify unstructured event reports, builds a causal knowledge base by estimating average treatment effects, and injects this knowledge into a dual-stream GNN-LSTM network using a novel causal attention mechanism to adjust and enhance the forecast. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that Event-CausNet achieves robust performance, reducing prediction error (MAE) by up to 35.87%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our framework bridges the gap between correlational models and causal reasoning, providing a solution that is more accurate and transferable, while also offering crucial interpretability, providing a more reliable foundation for real-world traffic management during critical disruptions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Context Learning with Temporal Difference Convolution for Moving Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09352v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moving infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a critical role in practical applications, such as surveillance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and UAV-based search system. Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features. Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets demonstrate that our TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

This massive upscaling motivates a departure from wind forecasting methods that traditionally focused on a single representative height. To fill this gap, we propose DeepMIDE--a statistical deep learning method which jointly models the offshore wind speeds across space, time, and height. DeepMIDE is formulated as a multi-output integro-difference equation model with a multivariate nonstationary kernel characterized by a set of advection vectors that encode the physics of wind field formation and propagation. Embedded within DeepMIDE, an advanced deep learning architecture learns these advection vectors from high-dimensional streams of exogenous weather information, which, along with other parameters, are plugged back into the statistical model for probabilistic multi-height space-time forecasting. Tested on real-world data from offshore wind energy areas in the Northeastern United States, the wind speed and power forecasts from DeepMIDE are shown to outperform those from prevalent time series, spatio-temporal, and deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |

However, current models struggle with ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i) Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii) Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior performance of STA-GANN.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIMERIPPLE: Accelerating vDiTs by Understanding the Spatio-Temporal Correlations in Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12035v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent surge in video generation has shown the growing demand for high-quality video synthesis using large vision models. Existing video generation models are predominantly based on the video diffusion transformer (vDiT), however, they suffer from substantial inference delay due to self-attention. While prior studies have focused on reducing redundant computations in self-attention, they often overlook the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in video streams and directly leverage sparsity patterns from large language models to reduce attention computations. In this work, we take a principled approach to accelerate self-attention in vDiTs by leveraging the spatio-temporal correlations in the latent space. We show that the attention patterns within vDiT are primarily due to the dominant spatial and temporal correlations at the token channel level. Based on this insight, we propose a lightweight and adaptive reuse strategy that approximates attention computations by reusing partial attention scores of spatially or temporally correlated tokens along individual channels. We demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher computational savings (85\%) compared to state-of-the-art techniques over 4 vDiTs, while preserving almost identical video quality ($<$0.06\% loss on VBench).</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking Dynamic Inter-Client Spatial Dependencies: A Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning Method for Traffic Flow Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10434v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graphs are powerful tools for modeling complex dependencies in traffic time series. However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Xiaoice: Training-Free Video Understanding via Self-Supervised Spatio-Temporal Clustering of Semantic Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16781v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive, task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments. These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content. This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is being withdrawn because we have identified a significant error in the implementation of our self-supervised clustering approach. Specifically, our feature aggregation step inadvertently leaked temporal information across frames, which violates the core assumption of our training-free method.

| **[DarkFarseer: Robust Spatio-temporal Kriging under Graph Sparsity and Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02808v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems, widespread sensor deployment has become essential. However, the high costs of building sensor networks limit their scale and coverage, making fine-grained deployment challenging. Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging (ISK) addresses this issue by introducing virtual sensors. Based on graph neural networks (GNNs) extracting the relationships between physical and virtual sensors, ISK can infer the measurements of virtual sensors from physical sensors. However, current ISK methods rely on conventional message-passing mechanisms and network architectures, without effectively extracting spatio-temporal features of physical sensors and focusing on representing virtual sensors. Additionally, existing graph construction methods face issues of sparse and noisy connections, destroying ISK performance. To address these issues, we propose DarkFarseer, a novel ISK framework with three key components. First, we propose the Neighbor Hidden Style Enhancement module with a style transfer strategy to enhance the representation of virtual nodes in a temporal-then-spatial manner to better extract the spatial relationships between physical and virtual nodes. Second, we propose Virtual-Component Contrastive Learning, which aims to enrich the node representation by establishing the association between the patterns of virtual nodes and the regional patterns within graph components. Lastly, we design a Similarity-Based Graph Denoising Strategy, which reduces the connectivity strength of noisy connections around virtual nodes and their neighbors based on their temporal information and regional spatial patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DarkFarseer significantly outperforms existing ISK methods.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI'26 |

Nevertheless, these models may be unreliable under distributional shifts, as their performance is significantly degraded. In this work, we investigate how to efficiently utilize class text information to mitigate distribution drifts encountered by VLMs during inference. In particular, we propose generating pseudo-labels for the noisy test-time samples by aligning visual embeddings with reliable, text-based semantic anchors. Specifically, to maintain the regular structure of the dataset properly, we formulate the problem as a batch-wise label assignment, which is efficiently solved using Optimal Transport. Our method, Semantic Anchor Transport (SAT), utilizes such pseudo-labels as supervisory signals for test-time adaptation, yielding a principled cross-modal alignment solution. Moreover, SAT further leverages heterogeneous textual clues, with a multi-template distillation approach that replicates multi-view contrastive learning strategies in unsupervised representation learning without incurring additional computational complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple popular test-time adaptation benchmarks presenting diverse complexity empirically show the superiority of SAT, achieving consistent performance gains over recent state-of-the-art methods, yet being computationally efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added additional figures to communicate the algorithm</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce the \textit{B-Spline Adaptive Tokenizer (BSAT)}, a novel, parameter-free method that adaptively segments a time series by fitting it with B-splines. BSAT algorithmically places tokens in high-curvature regions and represents each variable-length basis function as a fixed-size token, composed of its coefficient and position. Further, we propose a hybrid positional encoding that combines a additive learnable positional encoding with Rotary Positional Embedding featuring a layer-wise learnable base: L-RoPE. This allows each layer to attend to different temporal dependencies. Our experiments on several public benchmarks show that our model is competitive with strong performance at high compression rates. This makes it particularly well-suited for use cases with strong memory constraints.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

However, current models do not yet convey the feeling of truly interactive communication, often generating one-way responses that lack emotional engagement. We identify two key challenges toward truly interactive avatars: generating motion in real-time under causal constraints and learning expressive, vibrant reactions without additional labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose Avatar Forcing, a new framework for interactive head avatar generation that models real-time user-avatar interactions through diffusion forcing. This design allows the avatar to process real-time multimodal inputs, including the user's audio and motion, with low latency for instant reactions to both verbal and non-verbal cues such as speech, nods, and laughter. Furthermore, we introduce a direct preference optimization method that leverages synthetic losing samples constructed by dropping user conditions, enabling label-free learning of expressive interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables real-time interaction with low latency (approximately 500ms), achieving 6.8X speedup compared to the baseline, and produces reactive and expressive avatar motion, which is preferred over 80% against the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://taekyungki.github.io/AvatarForcing/</p></details> |

It is capable of real-time monitoring and evaluation of patients'motion during rehabilitation, providing immediate feedback and guidance to assist patients in executing rehabilitation exercises correctly. Firstly, we introduce a unified pipeline for end-to-end real-time human pose estimation and motion analysis using RGB video input from multiple cameras which can be applied to the field of rehabilitation training. The pipeline can help to monitor and correct patients'actions, thus aiding them in regaining muscle strength and motor functions. Secondly, we propose a fast tracking method for medical rehabilitation scenarios with multiple-person interference, which requires less than 1ms for tracking for a single frame. Additionally, we modify SmoothNet for real-time posture estimation, effectively reducing pose estimation errors and restoring the patient's true motion state, making it visually smoother. Finally, we use Unity platform for real-time monitoring and evaluation of patients' motion during rehabilitation, and to display the muscle stress conditions to assist patients with their rehabilitation training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cycling Race Time Prediction: A Personalized Machine Learning Approach Using Route Topology and Training Load](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00604v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting cycling duration for a given route is essential for training planning and event preparation. Existing solutions rely on physics-based models that require extensive parameterization, including aerodynamic drag coefficients and real-time wind forecasts, parameters impractical for most amateur cyclists. This work presents a machine learning approach that predicts ride duration using route topology features combined with the athlete's current fitness state derived from training load metrics. The model learns athlete-specific performance patterns from historical data, substituting complex physical measurements with historical performance proxies. We evaluate the approach using a single-athlete dataset (N=96 rides) in an N-of-1 study design. After rigorous feature engineering to eliminate data leakage, we find that Lasso regression with Topology + Fitness features achieves MAE=6.60 minutes and R2=0.922. Notably, integrating fitness metrics (CTL, ATL) reduces error by 14% compared to topology alone (MAE=7.66 min), demonstrating that physiological state meaningfully constrains performance even in self-paced efforts. Progressive checkpoint predictions enable dynamic race planning as route difficulty becomes apparent.</p></details> | 14 pages, 22 figures |

Traditional test-time augmentation (TTA) techniques typically rely on predefined geometric and photometric transformations, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness in complex medical scenarios. In this study, we introduced Test-Time Generative Augmentation (TTGA), a novel augmentation strategy specifically tailored for medical image segmentation at inference time. Different from conventional augmentation strategies that suffer from excessive randomness or limited flexibility, TTGA leverages a domain-fine-tuned generative model to produce contextually relevant and diverse augmentations tailored to the characteristics of each test image. Built upon diffusion model inversion, a masked null-text inversion method is proposed to enable region-specific augmentations during sampling. Furthermore, a dual denoising pathway is designed to balance precise identity preservation with controlled variability. We demonstrate the efficacy of our TTGA through extensive experiments across three distinct segmentation tasks spanning nine datasets. Our results consistently demonstrate that TTGA not only improves segmentation accuracy (with DSC gains ranging from 0.1% to 2.3% over the baseline) but also offers pixel-wise error estimation (with DSC gains ranging from 1.1% to 29.0% over the baseline).

To address these limitations, we introduce GaitMotion, a novel machine-learning framework that employs few-shot learning on a multitask dataset collected via wearable IMU sensors for real-time pathological gait analysis. GaitMotion enhances data quality through detailed, ground-truth-labeled sequences and achieves accurate step and stride segmentation and stride length estimation, which are essential for diagnosing neurological disorders. We incorporate a generative augmentation component, which synthesizes rare or underrepresented pathological gait patterns. GaitMotion achieves a 65\% increase in stride length estimation accuracy compared to ZUPT. In addition, its application to real patient datasets via transfer learning confirms its robust predictive capability. By integrating generative AI into wearable gait analysis, GaitMotion not only refines the precision of pathological gait forecasting but also demonstrates a scalable framework for leveraging synthetic data in biomechanical pattern recognition, paving the way for more personalized and data-efficient digital health services.</p></details> |  |

Existing anomaly detection methods are ill-suited for this challenge: mean-pooling embeddings dilutes anomalous steps, while contrastive-only approaches ignore sequential structure. Standard unsupervised methods on pre-trained embeddings achieve F1-scores no higher than 0.69. We introduce Trajectory Guard, a Siamese Recurrent Autoencoder with a hybrid loss function that jointly learns task-trajectory alignment via contrastive learning and sequential validity via reconstruction. This dual objective enables unified detection of both "wrong plan for this task" and "malformed plan structure." On benchmarks spanning synthetic perturbations and real-world failures from security audits (RAS-Eval) and multi-agent systems (Who\&When), we achieve F1-scores of 0.88-0.94 on balanced sets and recall of 0.86-0.92 on imbalanced external benchmarks. At 32 ms inference latency, our approach runs 17-27$\times$ faster than LLM Judge baselines, enabling real-time safety verification in production deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI Trustagent 2026</p></details> |

The key step is a Height Compression Theorem that uniformly (and in logspace) reshapes the canonical left-deep succinct computation tree for a block-respecting run into a binary tree whose evaluation-stack depth along any DFS path is $O(\log T)$ for $T=\lceil t/b\rceil$, while preserving $O(b)$ workspace at leaves and $O(1)$ at internal nodes. Edges have \emph{addressing/topology} checkable in $O(\log t)$ space, and \emph{semantic} correctness across merges is witnessed by an exact $O(b)$ bounded-window replay at the unique interface. Algorithmically, an Algebraic Replay Engine with constant-degree maps over a constant-size field, together with pointerless DFS, index-free streaming, and a \emph{rolling boundary buffer that prevents accumulation of leaf summaries}, ensures constant-size per-level tokens and eliminates wide counters, yielding the additive tradeoff $S(b)=O(b+t/b)$. Choosing $b=Θ(\sqrt{t})$ gives $O(\sqrt{t})$ space with no residual multiplicative polylog factors. The construction is uniform, relativizes, and is robust to standard model choices. Consequences include branching-program upper bounds $2^{O(\sqrt{s})}$ for size-$s$ bounded-fan-in circuits, tightened quadratic-time lower bounds for $\mathrm{SPACE}[n]$-complete problems via the standard hierarchy argument, and $O(\sqrt{t})$-space certifying interpreters; under explicit locality assumptions, the framework extends to geometric $d$-dimensional models. Conceptually, the work isolates path bookkeeping as the chief obstruction to $O(\sqrt{t})$ and removes it via structural height compression with per-path analysis rather than barrier-prone techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The proof of the main theorem is incorrect.

We explore whether time series foundation models (TSFMs), pretrained on large heterogeneous data, can serve as universal backbones for anomaly detection. Through systematic experiments across multiple benchmarks, we compare zero-shot inference, full model adaptation, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies. Our results demonstrate that TSFMs outperform task-specific baselines, achieving notable gains in AUC-PR and VUS-PR, particularly under severe class imbalance. Moreover, PEFT methods such as LoRA, OFT, and HRA not only reduce computational cost but also match or surpass full fine-tuning in most cases, indicating that TSFMs can be efficiently adapted for anomaly detection, even when pretrained for forecasting. These findings position TSFMs as promising general-purpose models for scalable and efficient time series anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

Discrete-event simulators are faster and cheaper, but they require re-implementing the serving system's control logic -- a burden that compounds as frameworks evolve. We present Revati, a time-warp emulator that enables performance modeling by directly executing real serving system code at simulation-like speed. The system intercepts CUDA API calls to virtualize device management, allowing serving frameworks to run without physical GPUs. Instead of executing GPU kernels, it performs time jumps -- fast-forwarding virtual time by predicted kernel durations. We propose a coordination protocol that synchronizes these jumps across distributed processes while preserving causality. On vLLM and SGLang, Revati achieves less than 5% prediction error across multiple models and parallelism configurations, while running 5-17x faster than real GPU execution.</p></details> |  |

Most traditional approaches depend on utilizing handcrafted features, which are problem-dependent and optimal for specific tasks. Moreover, they are highly susceptible to dynamical events such as illumination changes, camera jitter, and variations in object sizes. On the other hand, the proposed feature learning approaches are cheaper and easier because highly abstract and discriminative features can be produced automatically without the need of expert knowledge. In this paper, we utilize automatic feature learning methods, which combine optical flow and three different deep models (i.e., supervised convolutional neural network (S-CNN), pretrained CNN feature extractor, and hierarchical extreme learning machine) for human detection in videos captured using a nonstatic camera on an aerial platform with varying altitudes. The models are trained and tested on the publicly available and highly challenging UCF-ARG aerial dataset. The comparison between these models in terms of training, testing accuracy, and learning speed is analyzed. The performance evaluation considers five human actions (digging, waving, throwing, walking, and running). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methods are successful for the human detection task. The pretrained CNN produces an average accuracy of 98.09%. S-CNN produces an average accuracy of 95.6% with softmax and 91.7% with Support Vector Machines (SVM). H-ELM has an average accuracy of 95.9%.

This undermines metadata-only detection in a stand-alone consumer gateway. Therefore, consumer gateways need streaming intrusion detection on encrypted traffic using metadata only, under tight CPU and latency budgets. We present a streaming IDS for stand-alone gateways that instantiates a lightweight two-state unit derived from Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS) dynamics per flow, named NOS-Gate. NOS-Gate scores fixed-length windows of metadata features and, under a $K$-of-$M$ persistence rule, triggers a reversible mitigation that temporarily reduces the flow's weight under weighted fair queueing (WFQ). We evaluate NOS-Gate under timing-controlled evasion using an executable 'worlds' benchmark that specifies benign device processes, auditable attacker budgets, contention structure, and packet-level WFQ replay to quantify queue impact. All methods are calibrated label-free via burn-in quantile thresholding. Across multiple reproducible worlds and malicious episodes, at an achieved $0.1%$ false-positive operating point, NOS-Gate attains 0.952 incident recall versus 0.857 for the best baseline in these runs. Under gating, it reduces p99.9 queueing delay and p99.9 collateral delay with a mean scoring cost of ~ 2.09 μs per flow-window on CPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Sparse Tucker Decomposition and Graph Regularization for High-Dimensional Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00377v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods of vector autoregressive model for multivariate time series analysis make use of low-rank matrix approximation or Tucker decomposition to reduce the dimension of the over-parameterization issue. In this paper, we propose a sparse Tucker decomposition method with graph regularization for high-dimensional vector autoregressive time series. By stacking the time-series transition matrices into a third-order tensor, the sparse Tucker decomposition is employed to characterize important interactions within the transition third-order tensor and reduce the number of parameters. Moreover, the graph regularization is employed to measure the local consistency of the response, predictor and temporal factor matrices in the vector autoregressive model.The two proposed regularization techniques can be shown to more accurate parameters estimation. A non-asymptotic error bound of the estimator of the proposed method is established, which is lower than those of the existing matrix or tensor based methods. A proximal alternating linearized minimization algorithm is designed to solve the resulting model and its global convergence is established under very mild conditions. Extensive numerical experiments on synthetic data and real-world datasets are carried out to verify the superior performance of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

By characterizing the impact of angular sensing error on the communication spatial correlation matrix, we derive a closed form expression for the achievable rate under dual-scale channel estimation errors. Considering the different characteristics in time scales, we design the sensing duration for slow-varying large-scale channel and determine the update timing and frequency for fast-varying small-scale channel information within a given frame structure. We formulate an average achievable rate maximization problem under limited time resources and sensing Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) constraints, and propose a segmented golden based joint optimization algorithm to efficiently solve this nonconvex problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves significant performance improvement compared with the benchmark schemes, which further validate that the system can leverage additional sensing capabilities to enhance communication efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, conference</p></details> |

Nevertheless, Bitcoin achieves consensus at an expensive cost of energy. Proof-of-stake is one of the solutions for such a problem. Participants of PoS protocols achieve dynamic-availability in permissionless settings. Parties can join and leave the protocol at their will without notifying others. However, such protocol relies heavily on a central clock, providing the function of synchrony by collecting the finish status of every honest participant. In our protocol, the global function maintains the round information for each participant no longer needed. We analyze and modify the round into real-time based round model. Message delivery delay is also taken into consideration of the round length. However, participant need the connection of a real-world time global clock which is crucial to calculate the current round. And round length also is adjusted due to the changing network situation at the start of every new epoch.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes a real-time intelligent traffic surveillance system tailored to such regions, using computer vision techniques to address vehicle detection, license plate recognition, and speed estimation. The study collected a rich dataset using a speed gun, a Canon Camera, and a mobile phone to train the models. License plate detection using YOLOv8 achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.9%. For character recognition of the detected license plate, the CNN model got a character error rate (CER) of 3.85%, while the transformer model significantly reduced the CER to 1.79%. Speed estimation used source and target regions of interest, yielding a good performance of 10 km/h margin of error. Additionally, a database was established to correlate user information with vehicle detection data, enabling automated ticket issuance via SMS via Africa's Talking API. This system addresses critical traffic management needs in resource-constrained environments and shows potential to reduce road accidents through automated traffic enforcement in developing countries where such interventions are urgently needed.</p></details> |  |

The estimator is motivated by difficulties with the computation of existing spectral density estimators for time series of functions defined on very large grids that arise, for example, in climate compute models and medical scans. Existing estimators use autocovariance kernels represented as large $G \times G$ matrices, where $G$ is the number of grid points on which the functions are evaluated. In many recent applications, functions are defined on 2D and 3D domains, and $G$ can be of the order $G \sim 10^5$, making the evaluation of the autocovariance kernels computationally intensive or even impossible. We use the theory of spectral functional principal components to derive our deep learning estimator and prove that it is a universal approximator to the spectral density under general assumptions. Our estimator can be trained without computing the autocovariance kernels and it can be parallelized to provide the estimates much faster than existing approaches. We validate its performance by simulations and an application to fMRI images.</p></details> |  |

We present UltraGS, a real-time framework that adapts Gaussian Splatting to sensorless ultrasound imaging by integrating explicit radiance fields with lightweight, physics-inspired acoustic modeling. UltraGS employs depth-aware Gaussian primitives with learnable fields of view to improve geometric consistency under unconstrained probe motion, and introduces PD Rendering, a differentiable acoustic operator that combines low-order spherical harmonics with first-order wave effects for efficient intensity synthesis. We further present a clinical ultrasound dataset acquired under real-world scanning protocols. Extensive evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that UltraGS establishes a new performance-efficiency frontier, achieving state-of-the-art results in PSNR (up to 29.55) and SSIM (up to 0.89) while achieving real-time synthesis at 64.69 fps on a single GPU.

To handle testing domains, domain adaptation (DA) is trained to adapt to a fixed and observed testing domain; a more challenging paradigm, test-time adaptation (TTA), cannot access the testing domain during training and online adapts to the testing samples during testing, where the samples are from a fixed domain. We aim to explore a more practical and underexplored scenario, continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) for text understanding, which involves a sequence of testing (unobserved) domains in testing. Current CTTA methods struggle in reducing error accumulation over domains and enhancing generalization to handle unobserved domains: 1) Noise-filtering reduces accumulated errors but discards useful information, and 2) accumulating historical domains enhances generalization, but it is hard to achieve adaptive accumulation. In this paper, we propose a CTTA-T (continual test-time adaptation for text understanding) framework adaptable to evolving target domains: it adopts a teacher-student framework, where the teacher is domain-aware and generalized for evolving domains. To improve teacher predictions, we propose a refine-then-filter based on dropout-driven consistency, which calibrates predictions and removes unreliable guidance. For the adaptation-generalization trade-off, we construct a domain-aware teacher by dynamically accumulating cross-domain semantics via incremental PCA, which continuously tracks domain shifts. Experiments show CTTA-T excels baselines.</p></details> |  |

Training-time alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) face prohibitive costs in expert supervision and inherent scalability limitations, offering limited dynamic control during inference. Consequently, there is an urgent need for scalable and adaptable alignment mechanisms. To address this, we propose W2S-AlignTree, a pioneering plug-and-play inference-time alignment framework that synergistically combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with the Weak-to-Strong Generalization paradigm for the first time. W2S-AlignTree formulates LLM alignment as an optimal heuristic search problem within a generative search tree. By leveraging weak model's real-time, step-level signals as alignment proxies and introducing an Entropy-Aware exploration mechanism, W2S-AlignTree enables fine-grained guidance during strong model's generation without modifying its parameters. The approach dynamically balances exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional generation search trees. Experiments across controlled sentiment generation, summarization, and instruction-following show that W2S-AlignTree consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, W2S-AlignTree raises the performance of Llama3-8B from 1.89 to 2.19, a relative improvement of 15.9 on the summarization task.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 Oral |

In this paper, we first identify three primary types of knowledge conflicts that contribute to catastrophic forgetting in YOLO-based incremental detectors: foreground-background confusion, parameter interference, and misaligned knowledge distillation. Subsequently, we introduce YOLO-IOD, a real-time Incremental Object Detection (IOD) framework that is constructed upon the pretrained YOLO-World model, facilitating incremental learning via a stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning process. Specifically, YOLO-IOD encompasses three principal components: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR), which mitigates the foreground-background confusion by leveraging the confidence levels of pseudo labels and identifying potential objects relevant to future tasks. 2) Importancebased Kernel Selection (IKS), which identifies and updates the pivotal convolution kernels pertinent to the current task during the current learning stage. 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD), which addresses the misaligned knowledge distillation conflict by transmitting the features of the student target detector through the detection heads of both the previous and current teacher detectors, thereby facilitating asymmetric distillation between existing and newly introduced categories. We further introduce LoCo COCO, a more realistic benchmark that eliminates data leakage across stages. Experiments on both conventional and LoCo COCO benchmarks show that YOLO-IOD achieves superior performance with minimal forgetting.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 accepted.

While prior work has primarily focused on refining scoring functions and adjusting test-time thresholds, such algorithmic improvements offer only incremental gains. We argue that a rethinking of the entire development lifecycle is needed to mitigate these risks effectively. This work addresses two overlooked dimensions of OoD detection in object detection. First, we reveal fundamental flaws in widely used evaluation benchmarks: contrary to their design intent, up to 13% of objects in the OoD test sets actually belong to in-distribution classes, and vice versa. These quality issues severely distort the reported performance of existing methods and contribute to their high false positive rates. Second, we introduce a novel training-time mitigation paradigm that operates independently of external OoD detectors. Instead of relying solely on post-hoc scoring, we fine-tune the detector using a carefully synthesized OoD dataset that semantically resembles in-distribution objects. This process shapes a defensive decision boundary by suppressing objectness on OoD objects, leading to a 91% reduction in hallucination error of a YOLO model on BDD-100K. Our methodology generalizes across detection paradigms such as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and RT-DETR, and supports few-shot adaptation. Together, these contributions offer a principled and effective way to reduce OoD-induced hallucination in object detectors.

| **[Reinforcement learning with timed constraints for robotics motion planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00087v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic systems operating in dynamic and uncertain environments increasingly require planners that satisfy complex task sequences while adhering to strict temporal constraints. Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) offers a formal and expressive framework for specifying such time-bounded requirements; however, integrating MITL with reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to stochastic dynamics and partial observability. This paper presents a unified automata-based RL framework for synthesizing policies in both Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) under MITL specifications. MITL formulas are translated into Timed Limit-Deterministic Generalized Büchi Automata (Timed-LDGBA) and synchronized with the underlying decision process to construct product timed models suitable for Q-learning. A simple yet expressive reward structure enforces temporal correctness while allowing additional performance objectives. The approach is validated in three simulation studies: a $5 \times 5$ grid-world formulated as an MDP, a $10 \times 10$ grid-world formulated as a POMDP, and an office-like service-robot scenario. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently learns policies that satisfy strict time-bounded requirements under stochastic transitions, scales to larger state spaces, and remains effective in partially observable environments, highlighting its potential for reliable robotic planning in time-critical and uncertain settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpaceTimePilot: Generative Rendering of Dynamic Scenes Across Space and Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25075v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

| **[End-to-End Test-Time Training for Long Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23675v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We formulate long-context language modeling as a problem in continual learning rather than architecture design. Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context.

| **[Modewise Additive Factor Model for Matrix Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25025v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a Modewise Additive Factor Model (MAFM) for matrix-valued time series that captures row-specific and column-specific latent effects through an additive structure, offering greater flexibility than multiplicative frameworks such as Tucker and CP factor models. In MAFM, each observation decomposes into a row-factor component, a column-factor component, and noise, allowing distinct sources of variation along different modes to be modeled separately. We develop a computationally efficient two-stage estimation procedure: Modewise Inner-product Eigendecomposition (MINE) for initialization, followed by Complement-Projected Alternating Subspace Estimation (COMPAS) for iterative refinement. The key methodological innovation is that orthogonal complement projections completely eliminate cross-modal interference when estimating each loading space. We establish convergence rates for the estimated factor loading matrices under proper conditions. We further derive asymptotic distributions for the loading matrix estimators and develop consistent covariance estimators, yielding a data-driven inference framework that enables confidence interval construction and hypothesis testing. As a technical contribution of independent interest, we establish matrix Bernstein inequalities for quadratic forms of dependent matrix time series. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhysTalk: Language-driven Real-time Physics in 3D Gaussian Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24986v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic visual simulations are omnipresent, yet their creation requires computing time, rendering, and expert animation knowledge. Open-vocabulary visual effects generation from text inputs emerges as a promising solution that can unlock immense creative potential. However, current pipelines lack both physical realism and effective language interfaces, requiring slow offline optimization. In contrast, PhysTalk takes a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene as input and translates arbitrary user prompts into real time, physics based, interactive 4D animations. A large language model (LLM) generates executable code that directly modifies 3DGS parameters through lightweight proxies and particle dynamics. Notably, PhysTalk is the first framework to couple 3DGS directly with a physics simulator without relying on time consuming mesh extraction. While remaining open vocabulary, this design enables interactive 3D Gaussian animation via collision aware, physics based manipulation of arbitrary, multi material objects. Finally, PhysTalk is train-free and computationally lightweight: this makes 4D animation broadly accessible and shifts these workflows from a "render and wait" paradigm toward an interactive dialogue with a modern, physics-informed pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[PRISM: A hierarchical multiscale approach for time series forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24898v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting is critical in areas such as finance, biology, and healthcare. Despite the progress in the field, making accurate forecasts remains challenging because real-world time series contain both global trends, local fine-grained structure, and features on multiple scales in between. Here, we present a new forecasting method, PRISM (Partitioned Representation for Iterative Sequence Modeling), that addresses this challenge through a learnable tree-based partitioning of the signal. At the root of the tree, a global representation captures coarse trends in the signal, while recursive splits reveal increasingly localized views of the signal. At each level of the tree, data are projected onto a time-frequency basis (e.g., wavelets or exponential moving averages) to extract scale-specific features, which are then aggregated across the hierarchy. This design allows the model to jointly capture global structure and local dynamics of the signal, enabling accurate forecasting. Experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for forecasting. Overall, these results demonstrate that our hierarchical approach provides a lightweight and flexible framework for forecasting multivariate time series.

| **[Towards autonomous time-calibration of large quantum-dot devices: Detection, real-time feedback, and noise spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24894v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance and scalability of semiconductor quantum-dot (QD) qubits are limited by electrostatic drift and charge noise that shift operating points and destabilize qubit parameters. As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array. From our analysis, we find that the background noise at 100~$μ$\si{\hertz} is dominated by drift with a power law of $1/f^2$, accompanied by a few dominant two-level fluctuators and an average linear correlation length of $(188 \pm 38)$~\si{\nano\meter} in the device. These capabilities form the basis of a scalable, autonomous calibration and characterization module for QD-based quantum processors, providing essential feedback for long-duration, high-fidelity qubit operations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

Existing approaches often compromise visual fidelity by enforcing strictly unidirectional attention mechanisms or reducing model capacity. To address this problem, we introduce \textbf{SoulX-LiveTalk}, a 14B-parameter framework optimized for high-fidelity real-time streaming. Diverging from conventional unidirectional paradigms, we use a \textbf{Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation} strategy that retains bidirectional attention within video chunks. This design preserves critical spatiotemporal correlations, significantly enhancing motion coherence and visual detail. To ensure stability during infinite generation, we incorporate a \textbf{Multi-step Retrospective Self-Correction Mechanism}, enabling the model to autonomously recover from accumulated errors and preventing collapse. Furthermore, we engineered a full-stack inference acceleration suite incorporating hybrid sequence parallelism, Parallel VAE, and kernel-level optimizations. Extensive evaluations confirm that SoulX-LiveTalk is the first 14B-scale system to achieve a \textbf{sub-second start-up latency (0.87s)} while reaching a real-time throughput of \textbf{32 FPS}, setting a new standard for high-fidelity interactive digital human synthesis.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Novel Compression Framework for YOLOv8: Achieving Real-Time Aerial Object Detection on Edge Devices via Structured Pruning and Channel-Wise Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12918v3)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels, significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to 13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from 26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.</p></details> | 28 pages, 11 figures |

To address this problem, prior works have developed complex task-specific architectures, novel modules to embed time into MLLMs, or leveraged additional input signals such as video transcripts to best encode contextual and temporal information. We find that most of these efforts are surpassed by a much simpler design. We introduce Chrono, a universal sequence blueprint that can be applied to any image-text pretrained MLLM.

Prior solutions rely on offline domain adaptation, which is post-hoc, data-intensive, and slow. We introduce the first test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for generative SLMs that process interleaved audio-text prompts. Our method updates a small, targeted subset of parameters during inference using only the incoming utterance, requiring no source data or labels. This stabilizes token distributions and improves robustness to acoustic variability without degrading core task accuracy. Evaluated on automatic speech recognition, speech translation, and 19 audio understanding tasks from AIR-Bench, our approach yields consistent gains under diverse corruptions. Because adaptation touches only a small fraction of weights, it is both compute- and memory-efficient, supporting deployment on resource-constrained platforms. This work enhances the robustness and adaptability of generative SLMs for real-world speech-driven applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSRE: Latent Semantic Rule Encoding for Real-Time Semantic Risk Detection in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24712v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world autonomous driving must adhere to complex human social rules that extend beyond legally codified traffic regulations. Many of these semantic constraints, such as yielding to emergency vehicles, complying with traffic officers' gestures, or stopping for school buses, are intuitive for humans yet difficult to encode explicitly. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) can interpret such semantics, their inference cost makes them impractical for real-time deployment.This work proposes LSRE, a Latent Semantic Rule Encoding framework that converts sparsely sampled VLM judgments into decision boundaries within the latent space of a recurrent world model. By encoding language-defined safety semantics into a lightweight latent classifier, LSRE enables real-time semantic risk assessment at 10 Hz without per-frame VLM queries. Experiments on six semantic-failure scenarios in CARLA demonstrate that LSRE attains semantic risk detection accuracy comparable to a large VLM baseline, while providing substantially earlier hazard anticipation and maintaining low computational latency. LSRE further generalizes to rarely seen semantic-similar test cases, indicating that language-guided latent classification offers an effective and deployable mechanism for semantic safety monitoring in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness. Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general, coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +9.28% average improvement on six benchmarks for DeepSeek-R1-7B and +11.25% on AIME2024 using Ling-mini-2.0-while remaining highly efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/EnVision-Research/MTI</p></details> |
| **[VLA-RAIL: A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker for VLA Models and Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24673v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in robotics, with the action chunk playing a dominant role in these advances. Given the real-time and continuous nature of robotic motion control, the strategies for fusing a queue of successive action chunks have a profound impact on the overall performance of VLA models. Existing methods suffer from jitter, stalling, or even pauses in robotic action execution, which not only limits the achievable execution speed but also reduces the overall success rate of task completion. This paper introduces VLA-RAIL (A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker), a novel framework designed to address these issues by conducting model inference and robot motion control asynchronously and guaranteeing smooth, continuous, and high-speed action execution. The core contributions of the paper are two fold: a Trajectory Smoother that effectively filters out the noise and jitter in the trajectory of one action chunk using polynomial fitting and a Chunk Fuser that seamlessly align the current executing trajectory and the newly arrived chunk, ensuring position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between two successive action chunks. We validate the effectiveness of VLA-RAIL on a benchmark of dynamic simulation tasks and several real-world manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-RAIL significantly reduces motion jitter, enhances execution speed, and improves task success rates, which will become a key infrastructure for the large-scale deployment of VLA models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding and Steering the Cognitive Behaviors of Reasoning Models at Test-Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24574v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks. While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

| **[PERK: Long-Context Reasoning as Parameter-Efficient Test-Time Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06415v2)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-context reasoning requires accurately identifying relevant information in extensive, noisy input contexts. Previous research shows that using test-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can effectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning methods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive, preventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for learning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight model adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization loops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a low-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for the base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter to accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long context. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK significantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline, achieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models (GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In general, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and the locations of relevant information in contexts. Finally, we show that while PERK is memory-intensive during training, it scales more efficiently at inference time than prompt-based long-context inference.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

We study whether or not including more models always improves their average performance. This question depends on the kind of ensemble considered, as well as the predictive metric chosen. We focus on situations where all members of the ensemble are a priori expected to perform equally well, which is the case of several popular methods such as random forests or deep ensembles. In this setting, we show that ensembles are getting better all the time if, and only if, the considered loss function is convex. More precisely, in that case, the loss of the ensemble is a decreasing function of the number of models. When the loss function is nonconvex, we show a series of results that can be summarised as: ensembles of good models keep getting better, and ensembles of bad models keep getting worse. To this end, we prove a new result on the monotonicity of tail probabilities that may be of independent interest. We illustrate our results on a medical problem (diagnosing melanomas using neural nets) and a "wisdom of crowds" experiment (guessing the ratings of upcoming movies).</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final JMLR version, see journal version at http://jmlr.org/papers/v26/24-0408.html</p></details> |
| **[Time-Aware Adaptive Side Information Fusion for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24246v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating item-side information, such as category and brand, into sequential recommendation is a well-established and effective approach for improving performance. However, despite significant advancements, current models are generally limited by three key challenges: they often overlook the fine-grained temporal dynamics inherent in timestamps, exhibit vulnerability to noise in user interaction sequences, and rely on computationally expensive fusion architectures. To systematically address these challenges, we propose the Time-Aware Adaptive Side Information Fusion (TASIF) framework. TASIF integrates three synergistic components: (1) a simple, plug-and-play time span partitioning mechanism to capture global temporal patterns; (2) an adaptive frequency filter that leverages a learnable gate to denoise feature sequences adaptively, thereby providing higher-quality inputs for subsequent fusion modules; and (3) an efficient adaptive side information fusion layer, this layer employs a "guide-not-mix" architecture, where attributes guide the attention mechanism without being mixed into the content-representing item embeddings, ensuring deep interaction while ensuring computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that TASIF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining excellent efficiency in training.

| **[YOLO-Master: MOE-Accelerated with Specialized Transformers for Enhanced Real-time Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23273v2)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Real-Time Object Detection (RTOD) methods commonly adopt YOLO-like architectures for their favorable trade-off between accuracy and speed. However, these models rely on static dense computation that applies uniform processing to all inputs, misallocating representational capacity and computational resources such as over-allocating on trivial scenes while under-serving complex ones. This mismatch results in both computational redundancy and suboptimal detection performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose YOLO-Master, a novel YOLO-like framework that introduces instance-conditional adaptive computation for RTOD. This is achieved through a Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) block that dynamically allocates computational resources to each input according to its scene complexity. At its core, a lightweight dynamic routing network guides expert specialization during training through a diversity enhancing objective, encouraging complementary expertise among experts. Additionally, the routing network adaptively learns to activate only the most relevant experts, thereby improving detection performance while minimizing computational overhead during inference. Comprehensive experiments on five large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of YOLO-Master. On MS COCO, our model achieves 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% mAP and 17.8% faster inference. Notably, the gains are most pronounced on challenging dense scenes, while the model preserves efficiency on typical inputs and maintains real-time inference speed. Code will be available.</p></details> |  |

By applying a new general data transformation, that randomly perturbs multiple times the PCA subspace projection of a test input, GTTA creates valid augmented samples from the data distribution with high diversity, properties we theoretically show that are essential for a Test-Time Augmentation method to be effective. Different from other existing methods, we also propose a final self-supervised learning stage in which the ensemble output, acting as an unsupervised teacher, is used to train the initial single student model, thus reducing significantly the test time computational cost. Our comparisons to strong TTA approaches and SoTA models on various vision and non-vision well-known datasets and tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, pneumonia detection, speech recognition and house price prediction, validate the generality of the proposed GTTA. Furthermore, we also prove its effectiveness on the more specific real-world task of salmon segmentation and detection in low-visibility underwater videos, for which we introduce DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature.</p></details> |  |

Existing remote monitoring approaches often prioritise maximising spatial coverage to train generalistic models or rely on optical imagery hampered by persistent cloud coverage. This paper presents an end-to-end, automated deep learning pipeline for the targeted monitoring of high-risk Himalayan glacial lakes using time-series Sentinel-1 SAR. We introduce a "temporal-first" training strategy, utilising a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B3 backbone trained on a curated dataset of a cohort of 4 lakes (Tsho Rolpa, Chamlang Tsho, Tilicho and Gokyo Lake). The model achieves an IoU of 0.9130 validating the success and efficacy of the "temporal-first" strategy required for transitioning to Early Warning Systems. Beyond the model, we propose an operational engineering architecture: a Dockerised pipeline that automates data ingestion via the ASF Search API and exposes inference results via a RESTful endpoint. This system shifts the paradigm from static mapping to dynamic and automated early warning, providing a scalable architectural foundation for future development in Early Warning Systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

This design typically achieves higher sample efficiency than purely on-policy methods. However, critic networks tend to overestimate value estimates systematically. This is often addressed by introducing a pessimistic bias based on uncertainty estimates. Current methods employ ensembling to quantify the critic's epistemic uncertainty-uncertainty due to limited data and model ambiguity-to scale pessimistic updates. In this work, we propose a new algorithm called Stochastic Actor-Critic (STAC) that incorporates temporal (one-step) aleatoric uncertainty-uncertainty arising from stochastic transitions, rewards, and policy-induced variability in Bellman targets-to scale pessimistic bias in temporal-difference updates, rather than relying on epistemic uncertainty. STAC uses a single distributional critic network to model the temporal return uncertainty, and applies dropout to both the critic and actor networks for regularization. Our results show that pessimism based on a distributional critic alone suffices to mitigate overestimation, and naturally leads to risk-averse behavior in stochastic environments. Introducing dropout further improves training stability and performance by means of regularization. With this design, STAC achieves improved computational efficiency using a single distributional critic network.</p></details> | 19 pages |

While TKGs and their generalization, hyper-relational temporal knowledge graphs (HTKGs), offer a straightforward structure to represent simple temporal relationships, they lack the expressive power to convey complex facts efficiently. One of the critical limitations of HTKGs is a lack of support for more than two primary entities in temporal facts, which commonly occur in real-world events. To address this limitation, in this work, we study a generalization of HTKGs, Hyper-Relational Temporal Knowledge Generalized Hypergraphs (HTKGHs). We first derive a formalization for HTKGHs, demonstrating their backward compatibility while supporting two complex types of facts commonly found in geopolitical incidents. Then, utilizing this formalization, we introduce the htkgh-polecat dataset, built upon the global event database POLECAT. Finally, we benchmark and analyze popular LLMs on the relation prediction task, providing insights into their adaptability and capabilities in complex forecasting scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, this approach ignores other sources of conditional data, such as character sheets, background images, or arbitrary colorized frames. We propose TimeColor, a sketch-based video colorization model that supports heterogeneous, variable-count references with the use of explicit per-reference region assignment. TimeColor encodes references as additional latent frames which are concatenated temporally, permitting them to be processed concurrently in each diffusion step while keeping the model's parameter count fixed. TimeColor also uses spatiotemporal correspondence-masked attention to enforce subject-reference binding in addition to modality-disjoint RoPE indexing. These mechanisms mitigate shortcutting and cross-identity palette leakage. Experiments on SAKUGA-42M under both single- and multi-reference protocols show that TimeColor improves color fidelity, identity consistency, and temporal stability over prior baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Demo ...</summary><p>Demo samples are available at: https://bconstantine.github.io/TimeColor/</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Distillation for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00202v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning over temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) is fundamental to improving the efficiency and reliability of intelligent decision-making systems and has become a key technological foundation for future artificial intelligence applications. Despite recent progress, existing TKG reasoning models typically rely on large parameter sizes and intensive computation, leading to high hardware costs and energy consumption. These constraints hinder their deployment on resource-constrained, low-power, and distributed platforms that require real-time inference. Moreover, most existing model compression and distillation techniques are designed for static knowledge graphs and fail to adequately capture the temporal dependencies inherent in TKGs, often resulting in degraded reasoning performance. To address these challenges, we propose a distillation framework specifically tailored for temporal knowledge graph reasoning. Our approach leverages large language models as teacher models to guide the distillation process, enabling effective transfer of both structural and temporal reasoning capabilities to lightweight student models. By integrating large-scale public knowledge with task-specific temporal information, the proposed framework enhances the student model's ability to model temporal dynamics while maintaining a compact and efficient architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving a favorable trade-off between reasoning accuracy, computational efficiency, and practical deployability.</p></details> |  |

It provides accurate depth maps with sharp anatomical boundaries for each frame, temporally consistent predictions across frames, and real-time throughput. Unlike prior work that uses batched inputs, EndoStreamDepth processes individual frames with a temporal module to propagate inter-frame information. The framework contains three main components: (1) a single-frame depth network with endoscopy-specific transformation to produce accurate depth maps, (2) multi-level Mamba temporal modules that leverage inter-frame information to improve accuracy and stabilize predictions, and (3) a hierarchical design with comprehensive multi-scale supervision, where complementary loss terms jointly improve local boundary sharpness and global geometric consistency. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on two publicly available colonoscopy depth estimation datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation methods, EndoStreamDepth substantially improves performance, and it produces depth maps with sharp, anatomically aligned boundaries, which are essential to support downstream tasks such as automation for robotic surgery.

Detecting IMBs is difficult due to encoded digital advertisements, frequent changes in personnel and locations, and the reuse of shared infrastructure such as phone numbers and addresses. Traditional approaches, including community tips and regulatory inspections, are largely reactive and ineffective at revealing the broader operational networks traffickers rely on. To address these challenges, we introduce IMBWatch, a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) framework for large-scale IMB detection. IMBWatch constructs dynamic graphs from open-source intelligence, including scraped online advertisements, business license records, and crowdsourced reviews. Nodes represent heterogeneous entities such as businesses, aliases, phone numbers, and locations, while edges capture spatio-temporal and relational patterns, including co-location, repeated phone usage, and synchronized advertising. The framework combines graph convolutional operations with temporal attention mechanisms to model the evolution of IMB networks over time and space, capturing patterns such as intercity worker movement, burner phone rotation, and coordinated advertising surges. Experiments on real-world datasets from multiple U.S. cities show that IMBWatch outperforms baseline models, achieving higher accuracy and F1 scores. Beyond performance gains, IMBWatch offers improved interpretability, providing actionable insights to support proactive and targeted interventions. The framework is scalable, adaptable to other illicit domains, and released with anonymized data and open-source code to support reproducible research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI AISI 2026</p></details> |

Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

This study focuses on single-channel electroencephalography (EEG), a practical and widely available signal for automatic sleep staging. Existing approaches face challenges such as class imbalance, limited receptive-field modeling, and insufficient interpretability. This work proposes a context-aware and interpretable framework for single-channel EEG sleep staging, with particular emphasis on improving detection of the N1 stage. Many prior models operate as black boxes with stacked layers, lacking clearly defined and interpretable feature extraction roles.The proposed model combines compact multi-scale feature extraction with temporal modeling to capture both local and long-range dependencies. To address data imbalance, especially in the N1 stage, classweighted loss functions and data augmentation are applied. EEG signals are segmented into sub-epoch chunks, and final predictions are obtained by averaging softmax probabilities across chunks, enhancing contextual representation and robustness.The proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy of 89.72% and a macro-average F1-score of 85.46%. Notably, it attains an F1- score of 61.7% for the challenging N1 stage, demonstrating a substantial improvement over previous methods on the SleepEDF datasets. These results indicate that the proposed approach effectively improves sleep staging performance while maintaining interpretability and suitability for real-world clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

We analyse the generated flow sequences through the lens of statistical turbulence, examining the time-averaged turbulent kinetic energy spectra over generated sequences, and temporal decay of turbulent structures. For the non-stationary Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability, we assess the ability of the proposed method to capture evolving flow statistics across the most strongly time-varying flow regime. We additionally examine instantaneous fields and physically motivated metrics at key stages of the KHI flow evolution.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Hierarchical Context Alignment with Disentangled Geometric and Temporal Modeling for Semantic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08243v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera-based 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction (SOP) is crucial for understanding complex 3D scenes from limited 2D image observations. Existing SOP methods typically aggregate contextual features to assist the occupancy representation learning, alleviating issues like occlusion or ambiguity. However, these solutions often face misalignment issues wherein the corresponding features at the same position across different frames may have different semantic meanings during the aggregation process, which leads to unreliable contextual fusion results and an unstable representation learning process. To address this problem, we introduce a new Hierarchical context alignment paradigm for a more accurate SOP (Hi-SOP). Hi-SOP first disentangles the geometric and temporal context for separate alignment, which two branches are then composed to enhance the reliability of SOP. This parsing of the visual input into a local-global alignment hierarchy includes: (I) disentangled geometric and temporal separate alignment, within each leverages depth confidence and camera pose as prior for relevant feature matching respectively; (II) global alignment and composition of the transformed geometric and temporal volumes based on semantics consistency. Our method outperforms SOTAs for semantic scene completion on the SemanticKITTI & NuScenes-Occupancy datasets and LiDAR semantic segmentation on the NuScenes dataset.

In this paper, we enhance high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline. Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe in the Future, Dangerous in the Past: Dissecting Temporal and Linguistic Vulnerabilities in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24556v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into critical global infrastructure, the assumption that safety alignment transfers zero-shot from English to other languages remains a dangerous blind spot. This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the prevailing multilingual safety gap narrative. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a mechanism of Complex Interference where safety is determined by the intersection of variables. While models exhibited a Reverse Linguistic with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms. We propose Invariant Alignment as a necessary paradigm shift to ensure safety stability across linguistic and temporal shifts.</p></details> |  |

Most existing approaches rely on single-frame observation and employ simple concatenation for multi-modal fusion, which limits their ability to capture temporal context and hinders dynamic adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose a DRL-based navigation framework, DRL-TH, which leverages temporal graph attention and hierarchical graph pooling to integrate historical observations and adaptively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a temporal-guided graph attention network (TG-GAT) that incorporates temporal weights into attention scores to capture correlations between consecutive frames, thereby enabling the implicit estimation of scene evolution. In addition, we design a graph hierarchical abstraction module (GHAM) that applies hierarchical pooling and learnable weighted fusion to dynamically integrate RGB and LiDAR features, achieving balanced representation across multiple scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DRL-TH outperforms existing methods in various crowded environments. We also implemented DRL-TH control policy on a real UGV and showed that it performed well in real world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Spatio-Temporal Transport: From Rigid Advection to Realistic Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02756v4)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic models for spatio-temporal transport face a critical trade-off between physical realism and interpretability. The advection model with a single constant velocity is interpretable but physically limited by its perfect correlation over time. This work aims to bridge the gap between this simple framework and its physically realistic extensions. Our guiding principle is to introduce a spatial correlation structure that vanishes over time. To achieve this, we present two distinct approaches. The first constructs complex velocity structures, either through superpositions of advection components or by allowing the velocity to vary locally. The second is a spectral technique that replaces the singular spectrum of rigid advection with a more flexible form, introducing temporal decorrelation controlled by parameters. We accompany these models with efficient simulation algorithms and demonstrate their success in replicating complex dynamics, such as tropical cyclones and the solutions of partial differential equations. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of the proposed framework by comparing its simulations to real-world precipitation data from Hurricane Florence.</p></details> |  |

To study the TR ability in LLMs, prior works provide different ways for evaluating various aspects of TR ability. In this work, we propose an alternative perspective for evaluating TR ability by leveraging Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), and develop a pipeline to automatically synthesize challenges for assessing the TR ability of LLMs. Based on this pipeline, we construct a dataset, namely \LTL, consisting of $2000$ TR challenges, and benchmark 12 LLMs across 5 different methods. Furthermore, we conduct additional experiments to investigate the impact of increasing the number of formula operators and events on both LLM performance and the complexity of TR problems. We also perform qualitative analyses of their reasoning processes and the effects of varying the number of events and formula operators, which reveal 3 main issues in their temporal reasoning processes and the unexpected performance changes observed as problem complexity increases. We expect this work to provide valuable insights into the TR ability of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Factorized Learning for Temporally Grounded Video-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24097v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a "grounding then answering with evidence referencing" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach. Our source code is available at https://github.com/nusnlp/d2vlm.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 paper.

We propose Temporal Physics-Informed AI (TPI-AI), a hybrid framework that fuses deep temporal representations with physics-inspired interaction cues. A two-layer bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) encoder learns compact embeddings from multi-step trajectory histories; we concatenate these embeddings with kinematics-, safety-, and interaction-aware features (e.g., headway, TTC, and safe-gap indicators) and train a LightGBM classifier for three-class intention recognition (No-LC, Left-LC, Right-LC). To improve minority-class reliability, we apply imbalance-aware optimization including resampling/weighting and fold-wise threshold calibration. Experiments on two large-scale drone-based datasets, highD (straight highways) and exiD (ramp-rich environments), use location-based splits and evaluate prediction horizons T = 1, 2, 3 s. TPI-AI outperforms standalone LightGBM and Bi-LSTM baselines, achieving macro-F1 of 0.9562, 0.9124, 0.8345 on highD and 0.9247, 0.8197, 0.7605 on exiD at T = 1, 2, 3 s, respectively. These results show that combining physics-informed interaction features with learned temporal embeddings yields robust multi-scenario lane-change intention prediction.</p></details> |  |

Existing sample complexity analysis for policy mirror descent either focuses on the generative sampling model, or the Markovian sampling model but with the action values being explicitly approximated to certain pre-specified accuracy. In contrast, we consider the sample complexity of policy mirror descent with temporal difference (TD) learning under the Markovian sampling model. Two algorithms called Expected TD-PMD and Approximate TD-PMD have been presented, which are off-policy and mixed policy algorithms respectively. Under a small enough constant policy update step size, the $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ (a logarithm factor about $\varepsilon$ is hidden in $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$) sample complexity can be established for them to achieve average-time $\varepsilon$-optimality. The sample complexity is further improved to $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ (without the hidden logarithm factor) to achieve the last-iterate $\varepsilon$-optimality based on adaptive policy update step sizes.</p></details> |  |

Although advanced Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain: (i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns; and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (AI for Social Impact)</p></details> |
| **[Anomaly detection in satellite imagery through temporal inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23986v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting surface changes from satellite imagery is critical for rapid disaster response and environmental monitoring, yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay between atmospheric noise, seasonal variations, and sensor artifacts. Here we show that deep learning can leverage the temporal redundancy of satellite time series to detect anomalies at unprecedented sensitivity, by learning to predict what the surface should look like in the absence of change. We train an inpainting model built upon the SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct the last frame of a Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions, using globally distributed training data spanning diverse climate zones and land cover types. When applied to regions affected by sudden surface changes, the discrepancy between prediction and observation reveals anomalies that traditional change detection methods miss. We validate our approach on earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake sequence, demonstrating detection of a rift feature in Tepehan with higher sensitivity and specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detectors. Our method reaches detection thresholds approximately three times lower than baseline approaches, providing a path towards automated, global-scale monitoring of surface changes from freely available multi-spectral satellite data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint Breeds Generalization: Temporal Dynamics as an Inductive Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23916v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional deep learning prioritizes unconstrained optimization, yet biological systems operate under strict metabolic constraints. We propose that these physical constraints shape dynamics to function not as limitations, but as a temporal inductive bias that breeds generalization. Through a phase-space analysis of signal propagation, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry: expansive dynamics amplify noise, whereas proper dissipative dynamics compress phase space that aligns with the network's spectral bias, compelling the abstraction of invariant features. This condition can be imposed externally via input encoding, or intrinsically through the network's own temporal dynamics. Both pathways require architectures capable of temporal integration and proper constraints to decode induced invariants, whereas static architectures fail to capitalize on temporal structure. Through comprehensive evaluations across supervised classification, unsupervised reconstruction, and zero-shot reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that a critical "transition" regime maximizes generalization capability. These findings establish dynamical constraints as a distinct class of inductive bias, suggesting that robust AI development requires not only scaling and removing limitations, but computationally mastering the temporal characteristics that naturally promote generalization.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Integrating data from satellite products and ground monitors are increasingly used to produce exposure surfaces. However, spatio-temporal misalignment often induced from missing data introduces substantial uncertainty and reduces predictive accuracy. We propose a Bayesian weighted predictor regression framework that models spatio-temporal relationships when predictors are observed on irregular supports or have substantial missing data, and are not concurrent with the outcome. The key feature of our model is a spatio-temporal kernel that aggregates the predictor over local space-time neighborhoods, built directly into the likelihood, eliminating any separate gap-filling or forced data alignment stage. We introduce a numerical approximation using a Voronoi-based spatial quadrature combined with irregular temporal increments for estimation under data missingness and misalignment. We showed that misspecification of the spatial and temporal lags induced bias in the mean and parameter estimates, indicating the need for principled parameter selection. Simulation studies confirmed these findings, where careful tuning was critical to control bias and achieve accurate prediction, while the proposed quadrature performed well under severe missingness. As an illustrative application, we estimated fine particulate matter (PM$_{2.5}$) in northern California using satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and wildfire smoke plume indicators. Relative to a traditional collocated linear model, our approach improved out-of-sample predictive performance, reduced uncertainty, and yielded robust temporal predictions and spatial surface estimation. Our framework is extensible to additional spatio-temporally varying covariates and other kernel families.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, Updated results section</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking the Spatio-Temporal Alignment of End-to-End 3D Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23635v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal alignment is crucial for temporal modeling of end-to-end (E2E) perception in autonomous driving (AD), providing valuable structural and textural prior information. Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%. When semantics are corrupted (nuScenes-C), the enhancement of motion modeling by HAT enables more robust perception and planning in the E2E AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings -- extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline -- serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI AI for Social Impact 2026.

In this work, we harness the expressive power of quantitative Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (($\text{LTL}_f[\mathcal{F}]$)) to synthesize reward monitors that generate a dense stream of rewards for runtime-observable state trajectories. By providing nuanced feedback during training, these monitors guide agents toward optimal behaviour and help mitigate the well-known issue of sparse rewards under long-horizon decision making, which arises under the Boolean semantics dominating the current literature. Our framework is algorithm-agnostic and only relies on a state labelling function, and naturally accommodates specifying non-Markovian properties. Empirical results show that our quantitative monitors consistently subsume and, depending on the environment, outperform Boolean monitors in maximizing a quantitative measure of task completion and in reducing convergence time.</p></details> | Accepted at AAAI-26 |
| **[TV-RAG: A Temporal-aware and Semantic Entropy-Weighted Framework for Long Video Retrieval and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23483v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly emerged as the focus of multimedia AI research. Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model.

Existing graph analysis systems, mostly based on static snapshots, struggle to effectively capture information flows along the temporal dimension. To address this challenge, we introduce ChronoConnect, a novel system that enables tracking temporal pathways in temporal graph, especially beneficial to downstream mining tasks, e.g., understanding what are the critical pathways in propagating information towards a specific group of vertices. Built on ChronoConnect, users can conveniently configure and execute a variety of temporal traversal algorithms to efficiently analyze information diffusion processes under time constraints. Moreover, ChronoConnect utilizes parallel processing to tackle the explosive size-growth of evolving graphs. We showcase the effectiveness and enhanced performance of ChronoConnect through the implementation of algorithms that track pathways along highly dynamic vertices in temporal graphs. Furthermore, we offer an interactive user interface for graph visualization and query result exploration. We envision ChronoConnect to become a powerful tool for users to examine how information spreads over a temporal graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 4 figures.

In this report, we present a GeoSAM-based, semi-automatic workflow for rapid glacier delineation from Sentinel-2 surface reflectance imagery. The method combines late-summer image compositing, spectral-index-based identification of candidate ice areas, prompt-guided segmentation using GeoSAM, and physically based post-processing to derive annual glacier outlines. The workflow is demonstrated in the Ny-Alesund and Kongsfjorden region of western Svalbard across multiple years of the Sentinel-2 era. Results show that the approach produces spatially coherent and temporally consistent outlines for major glacier bodies, while most errors are associated with small features affected by water bodies, terrain shadows, or high surface variability. The reliance on derived RGB imagery makes the method flexible and transferable to other optical datasets, with improved performance expected at higher spatial resolution. Although user inspection remains necessary to filter incorrect polygons and adjust thresholds for local conditions, the workflow provides a fast and practical alternative for multi-temporal glacier mapping and ice-loss assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP): A Distribution-Free Statistical and Machine Learning Framework for Adaptive Risk Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05470v5)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose \textbf{Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP)}, a distribution-free framework for constructing well-calibrated prediction intervals in nonstationary time series. TCP couples a modern quantile forecaster with a split-conformal calibration layer on a rolling window and, in its \textbf{TCP-RM} variant, augments the conformal threshold with a single online Robbins-Monro (RM) offset to steer coverage toward a target level in real time. We benchmark TCP against GARCH, Historical Simulation, a rolling tree-based Quantile Regression (QR) model, a classical linear quantile regression baseline (QR-Linear), and an adaptive conformal method (ACI) across equities (S\&P 500), cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), and commodities (Gold). Three results are consistent across assets. First, both QR and QR-Linear yield the sharpest intervals but are materially under-calibrated, and even ACI remains below the nominal 95\% target in our full-sample backtests. Second, TCP (and TCP-RM) achieves near-nominal coverage across assets, with intervals that are wider than Historical Simulation in this evaluation (e.g., S\&P 500: 5.21 vs.\ 5.06). Third, the RM update changes calibration and width only marginally at our default hyperparameters. Crisis-window visualizations around March 2020 show TCP/TCP-RM expanding and then contracting their interval bands promptly as volatility spikes and recedes, with \textbf{red dots} marking days where realized returns fall outside the reported 95\% interval (miscoverage). A sensitivity study confirms robustness to window size and step-size choices. Overall, TCP provides a practical, theoretically grounded solution to calibrated uncertainty quantification under distribution shift, bridging statistical inference and machine learning for risk forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, uniform goal selection often results in sample inefficiency in multi-goal settings where agents must learn a universal goal-conditioned policy. Inspired by the adaptive and structured learning processes observed in biological systems, we propose a novel Student-Teacher learning paradigm with a Temporal Variance-Driven Curriculum to accelerate Goal-Conditioned RL. In this framework, the teacher module dynamically prioritizes goals with the highest temporal variance in the policy's confidence score, parameterized by the state-action value (Q) function. The teacher provides an adaptive and focused learning signal by targeting these high-uncertainty goals, fostering continual and efficient progress. We establish a theoretical connection between the temporal variance of Q-values and the evolution of the policy, providing insights into the method's underlying principles. Our approach is algorithm-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with existing RL frameworks. We demonstrate this through evaluation across 11 diverse robotic manipulation and maze navigation tasks. The results show consistent and notable improvements over state-of-the-art curriculum learning and goal-selection methods.</p></details> |  |

This study develops long-term forecasts of monthly rainfall across 19 districts of West Bengal using a century-scale dataset spanning 1900-2019. Daily rainfall records are aggregated into monthly series, resulting in 120 years of observations for each district. The forecasting task involves predicting the next 108 months (9 years, 2011-2019) while accounting for temporal dependencies and spatial interactions among districts. To address the nonlinear and complex structure of rainfall dynamics, we propose a hierarchical modeling framework that combines regression-based forecasting of yearly features with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for monthly prediction. Yearly features, such as annual totals, quarterly proportions, variability measures, skewness, and extremes, are first forecasted using regression models that incorporate both own lags and neighboring-district lags. These forecasts are then integrated as auxiliary inputs into an MLP model, which captures nonlinear temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in the monthly series. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical regression-MLP architecture provides robust long-term spatio-temporal forecasts, offering valuable insights for agriculture, irrigation planning, and water conservation strategies.</p></details> | 25 pages, 22 figures |

Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for processing such graphs, but the lack of transparency and explainability limits their practical adoption. Research on TGNN explainability is still in its early stages and faces several key issues: (i) Current methods are tailored to specific TGNN types, restricting generality. (ii) They suffer from high computational costs, making them unsuitable for large-scale networks. (iii) They often overlook the structural connectivity of explanations and require prior knowledge, reducing user-friendliness. To address these issues, we propose GRExplainer, the first universal, efficient, and user-friendly explanation method for TGNNs. GRExplainer extracts node sequences as a unified feature representation, making it independent of specific input formats and thus applicable to both snapshot-based and event-based TGNNs (the major types of TGNNs). By utilizing breadth-first search and temporal information to construct input node sequences, GRExplainer reduces redundant computation and improves efficiency. To enhance user-friendliness, we design a generative model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), enabling automated and continuous explanation generation. Experiments on six real-world datasets with three target TGNNs show that GRExplainer outperforms existing baseline methods in generality, efficiency, and user-friendliness.</p></details> |  |

Although many approaches have been proposed to address the subtle emotions in different modalities, the power of explanations and temporal alignments is still underexplored. Thus, this paper proposes the Text-routed sparse mixture-of-Experts model with eXplanation and Temporal alignment for MSA (TEXT). TEXT first augments explanations for MSA via Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM), and then novelly aligns the epresentations of audio and video through a temporality-oriented neural network block. TEXT aligns different modalities with explanations and facilitates a new text-routed sparse mixture-of-experts with gate fusion. Our temporal alignment block merges the benefits of Mamba and temporal cross-attention. As a result, TEXT achieves the best performance cross four datasets among all tested models, including three recently proposed approaches and three MLLMs. TEXT wins on at least four metrics out of all six metrics. For example, TEXT decreases the mean absolute error to 0.353 on the CH-SIMS dataset, which signifies a 13.5% decrement compared with recently proposed approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

These techniques fail in capturing fine-grained hand and facial cues and modeling long-range temporal dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal Modeling (USTM) framework, a spatio-temporal encoder that effectively models complex patterns using a combination of a Swin Transformer backbone enhanced with lightweight temporal adapter with positional embeddings (TAPE). Our framework captures fine-grained spatial features alongside short and long-term temporal context, enabling robust sign language recognition from RGB videos without relying on multi-stream inputs or auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments on benchmarked datasets including PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14T, and CSL-Daily demonstrate that USTM achieves state-of-the-art performance against RGB-based as well as multi-modal CSLR approaches, while maintaining competitive performance against multi-stream approaches. These results highlight the strength and efficacy of the USTM framework for CSLR. The code is available at https://github.com/gufranSabri/USTM</p></details> |  |

Hence, they are critical components of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. While many existing systems depend on multiple sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam videos presents a more challenging, yet more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate improved spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to enhance state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets (DAD, DoTA and DADA) show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-accident scores than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[SPECTRE: Spectral Pre-training Embeddings with Cylindrical Temporal Rotary Position Encoding for Fine-Grained sEMG-Based Movement Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22481v1)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding fine-grained movement from non-invasive surface Electromyography (sEMG) is a challenge for prosthetic control due to signal non-stationarity and low signal-to-noise ratios. Generic self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks often yield suboptimal results on sEMG as they attempt to reconstruct noisy raw signals and lack the inductive bias to model the cylindrical topology of electrode arrays. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPECTRE, a domain-specific SSL framework. SPECTRE features two primary contributions: a physiologically-grounded pre-training task and a novel positional encoding. The pre-training involves masked prediction of discrete pseudo-labels from clustered Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) representations, compelling the model to learn robust, physiologically relevant frequency patterns. Additionally, our Cylindrical Rotary Position Embedding (CyRoPE) factorizes embeddings along linear temporal and annular spatial dimensions, explicitly modeling the forearm sensor topology to capture muscle synergies. Evaluations on multiple datasets, including challenging data from individuals with amputation, demonstrate that SPECTRE establishes a new state-of-the-art for movement decoding, significantly outperforming both supervised baselines and generic SSL approaches. Ablation studies validate the critical roles of both spectral pre-training and CyRoPE. SPECTRE provides a robust foundation for practical myoelectric interfaces capable of handling real-world sEMG complexities.</p></details> |  |

However, significant challenges are posed by the fast, uneven propagation of shock waves and unstable testing conditions. To address these challenges, a novel framework is proposed that utilizes multiple event cameras to estimate the asymmetry of shock waves, leveraging its high-speed and high-dynamic range capabilities. Initially, a polar coordinate system is established, which encodes events to reveal shock wave propagation patterns, with adaptive region-of-interest (ROI) extraction through event offset calculations. Subsequently, shock wave front events are extracted using iterative slope analysis, exploiting the continuity of velocity changes. Finally, the geometric model of events and shock wave motion parameters is derived according to event-based optical imaging model, along with the 3D reconstruction model. Through the above process, multi-angle shock wave measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion are achieved. The results of the speed measurement are compared with those of the pressure sensors and the empirical formula, revealing a maximum error of 5.20% and a minimum error of 0.06%. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-precision measurement of the shock wave motion field with both high spatial and temporal resolution, representing significant progress.</p></details> |  |

This is especially true for temporal graph regression tasks due to the complex underlying spatio-temporal patterns in the graph. While interpretability concerns in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) mirror those of DNNs, no notable work has addressed the interpretability of temporal GNNs to the best of our knowledge. Innovative methods, such as prototypes, aim to make DNN models more interpretable. However, a combined approach based on prototype-based methods and Information Bottleneck (IB) principles has not yet been developed for temporal GNNs. Our research introduces a novel approach that uniquely integrates these techniques to enhance the interpretability of temporal graph regression models. The key contributions of our work are threefold: We introduce the Graph INterpretability in Temporal Regression task using Information bottleneck and Prototype (GINTRIP) framework, the first combined application of IB and prototype-based methods for interpretable temporal graph tasks. We derive a novel theoretical bound on mutual information (MI), extending the applicability of IB principles to graph regression tasks. We incorporate an unsupervised auxiliary classification head, fostering diverse concept representation using multi-task learning, which enhances the model's interpretability. Our model is evaluated on real-world datasets like traffic and crime, outperforming existing methods in both forecasting accuracy and interpretability-related metrics such as MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Enhance Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Coherence for Configurable Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07328v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) relies on technologies in the field of signal processing. Since the anomaly is quite ambiguous and unbounded, different detection demands may often be raised even in one scenario. Thus, we propose to design the configurable VAD with flexible solutions targeting to solve the issue that previous methods have to train their models from scratch and waste resources when detection demands even change slightly. Moreover, we also design a dataset with good compatibility to evaluate the VAD performance when changes happen in detection demands. Besides, videos contain important information regarding continuous changes in the object's appearance and motion. Thus, we also propose a module to establish the multi-scale spatial-temporal coherence, which improves the accuracy and has the ability to dynamically adjust and accurately capture spatial-temporal normal patterns. Experiments show that our method not only models coherence effectively but also has better configurable ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoZoomer: Reinforcement-Learned Temporal Focusing for Long Video Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22315v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks yet remain limited in long video understanding due to the limited context window. Consequently, prevailing approaches tend to rely on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection, which might overlook critical evidence and unable to correct its initial selection error during its reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner. Accordingly, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase on a curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to further refine the agentic policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, yielding strong performance across a broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. These emergent capabilities allow it to consistently surpass existing open-source models and even rival proprietary systems on challenging tasks, while achieving superior efficiency under reduced frame budgets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Inference for Spatial-Temporal Non-Gaussian Data Using Predictive Stacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04655v4)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analysing non-Gaussian spatial-temporal data requires introducing spatial as well as temporal dependence in generalised linear models through the link function of an exponential family distribution. Unlike in Gaussian likelihoods, inference is considerably encumbered by the inability to analytically integrate out the random effects and reduce the dimension of the parameter space. Iterative estimation algorithms struggle to converge due to the presence of weakly identified parameters. We devise Bayesian inference using predictive stacking that assimilates inference from analytically tractable conditional posterior distributions. We achieve this by expanding upon the Diaconis-Ylvisaker family of conjugate priors and exploiting generalised conjugate multivariate (GCM) distribution theory for exponential families, which enables exact sampling from analytically available posterior distributions conditional upon some process parameters. Subsequently, we assimilate inference over a range of values of these parameters using Bayesian predictive stacking. We evaluate inferential performance on simulated data, compare with full Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and apply our method to analyse spatially-temporally referenced avian count data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey database.</p></details> | 41 pages, 9 figures |

In practice, many referring expressions describe targets through recent motion or short-term interactions, which cannot be resolved from static appearance or geometry alone. We study temporal language-based 3D grounding, where the objective is to identify the referred object in the current frame by leveraging multi-frame observations. We propose TrackTeller, a temporal multimodal grounding framework that integrates LiDAR-image fusion, language-conditioned decoding, and temporal reasoning in a unified architecture. TrackTeller constructs a shared UniScene representation aligned with textual semantics, generates language-aware 3D proposals, and refines grounding decisions using motion history and short-term dynamics. Experiments on the NuPrompt benchmark demonstrate that TrackTeller consistently improves language-grounded tracking performance, outperforming strong baselines with a 70% relative improvement in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and a 3.15-3.4 times reduction in False Alarm Frequency.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnchorGK: Anchor-based Incremental and Stratified Graph Learning Framework for Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21569v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal kriging is a fundamental problem in sensor networks, driven by the sparsity of deployed sensors and the resulting missing observations. Although recent approaches model spatial and temporal correlations, they often under-exploit two practical characteristics of real deployments: the sparse spatial distribution of locations and the heterogeneous availability of auxiliary features across locations. To address these challenges, we propose AnchorGK, an Anchor-based Incremental and Stratified Graph Learning framework for inductive spatio-temporal kriging. AnchorGK introduces anchor locations to stratify the data in a principled manner. Anchors are constructed according to feature availability, and strata are then formed around these anchors. This stratification serves two complementary roles. First, it explicitly represents and continuously updates correlations between unobserved regions and surrounding observed locations within a graph learning framework. Second, it enables the systematic use of all available features across strata via an incremental representation mechanism, mitigating feature incompleteness without discarding informative signals. Building on the stratified structure, we design a dual-view graph learning layer that jointly aggregates feature-relevant and location-relevant information, learning stratum-specific representations that support accurate inference under inductive settings. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that AnchorGK consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for spatio-temporal kriging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coherence in the brain unfolds across separable temporal regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20481v3)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coherence in language requires the brain to satisfy two competing temporal demands: gradual accumulation of meaning across extended context and rapid reconfiguration of representations at event boundaries. Despite their centrality to language and thought, how these processes are implemented in the human brain during naturalistic listening remains unclear. Here, we tested whether these two processes can be captured by annotation-free drift and shift signals and whether their neural expression dissociates across large-scale cortical systems. These signals were derived from a large language model (LLM) and formalized contextual drift and event shifts directly from the narrative input. To enable high-precision voxelwise encoding models with stable parameter estimates, we densely sampled one healthy adult across more than 7 hours of listening to thirteen crime stories while collecting ultra high-field (7T) BOLD data. We then modeled the feature-informed hemodynamic response using a regularized encoding framework validated on independent stories. Drift predictions were prevalent in default-mode network hubs, whereas shift predictions were evident bilaterally in the primary auditory cortex and language association cortex. Furthermore, activity in default-mode and parietal networks was best explained by a signal capturing how meaning accumulates and gradually fades over the course of the narrative. Together, these findings show that coherence during language comprehension is implemented through dissociable neural regimes of slow contextual integration and rapid event-driven reconfiguration, offering a mechanistic entry point for understanding disturbances of language coherence in psychiatric disorders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Evidence Multimodal Reasoning for Few-shot Temporal Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13460v5)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional temporal action localization (TAL) methods rely on large amounts of detailed annotated data, whereas few-shot TAL reduces this dependence by using only a few training samples to identify unseen action categories. However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the action localization task. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Evidence multimodal reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level, we design a Chain-of-Evidence (CoE) reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoE text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3, THUMOS14 and our newly collected Human-related Anomaly Localization Dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios. Our source code and data are available at https://github.com/MICLAB-BUPT/VAL-VLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enforcing Temporal Constraints for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23738v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agents are deployed in safety-critical applications, yet current guardrail systems fail to prevent violations of temporal safety policies, requirements that govern the ordering and sequencing of agent actions. For instance, agents may access sensitive data before authenticating users or process refunds to unauthorized payment methods, violations that require reasoning about sequences of action rather than an individual action. Existing guardrails rely on imprecise natural language instructions or post-hoc monitoring, and provide no formal guarantees that agents will satisfy temporal constraints. We present Agent-C, a novel framework that provides run-time guarantees ensuring LLM agents adhere to formal temporal safety properties. Agent-C introduces a domain-specific language for expressing temporal properties (e.g., authenticate before accessing data), translates specifications to first-order logic, and uses SMT solving to detect non-compliant agent actions during token generation. When the LLM attempts to generate a non-compliant tool call, Agent-C leverages constrained generation techniques to ensure that every action generated by the LLM complies with the specification, and to generate a compliant alternative to a non-compliant agent action. We evaluate Agent-C across two real-world applications: retail customer service and airline ticket reservation system, and multiple language models (open and closed-source). Our results demonstrate that Agent-C achieves perfect safety (100% conformance, 0% harm), while improving task utility compared to state-of-the-art guardrails and unrestricted agents. On SoTA closed-source models, Agent-C improves conformance (77.4% to 100% for Claude Sonnet 4.5 and 83.7% to 100% for GPT-5), while simultaneously increasing utility (71.8% to 75.2% and 66.1% to 70.6%, respectively), representing a new SoTA frontier for reliable agentic reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Tubes for Probabilistic Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay Task in Uncertain Dynamic Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21497v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we extend the Spatiotemporal Tube (STT) framework to address Probabilistic Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay (PrT-RAS) tasks in dynamic environments with uncertain obstacles. We develop a real-time tube synthesis procedure that explicitly accounts for time-varying uncertain obstacles and provides formal probabilistic safety guarantees. The STT is formulated as a time-varying ball in the state space whose center and radius evolve online based on uncertain sensory information. We derive a closed-form, approximation-free control law that confines the system trajectory within the tube, ensuring both probabilistic safety and task satisfaction. Our method offers a formal guarantee for probabilistic avoidance and finite-time task completion. The resulting controller is model-free, approximation-free, and optimization-free, enabling efficient real-time execution while guaranteeing convergence to the target. The effectiveness and scalability of the framework are demonstrated through simulation studies and hardware experiments on mobile robots, a UAV, and a 7-DOF manipulator navigating in cluttered and uncertain environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Attention (DynAttn): Interpretable High-Dimensional Spatio-Temporal Forecasting (with Application to Conflict Fatalities)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21435v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting conflict-related fatalities remains a central challenge in political science and policy analysis due to the sparse, bursty, and highly non-stationary nature of violence data. We introduce DynAttn, an interpretable dynamic-attention forecasting framework for high-dimensional spatio-temporal count processes. DynAttn combines rolling-window estimation, shared elastic-net feature gating, a compact weight-tied self-attention encoder, and a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) likelihood. This architecture produces calibrated multi-horizon forecasts of expected casualties and exceedance probabilities, while retaining transparent diagnostics through feature gates, ablation analysis, and elasticity measures. We evaluate DynAttn using global country-level and high-resolution PRIO-grid-level conflict data from the VIEWS forecasting system, benchmarking it against established statistical and machine-learning approaches, including DynENet, LSTM, Prophet, PatchTST, and the official VIEWS baseline. Across forecast horizons from one to twelve months, DynAttn consistently achieves substantially higher predictive accuracy, with particularly large gains in sparse grid-level settings where competing models often become unstable or degrade sharply. Beyond predictive performance, DynAttn enables structured interpretation of regional conflict dynamics. In our application, cross-regional analyses show that short-run conflict persistence and spatial diffusion form the core predictive backbone, while climate stress acts either as a conditional amplifier or a primary driver depending on the conflict theater.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMTM: Benchmarking and Optimizing LLMs for Temporal Motif Analysis in Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22266v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) has motivated a growing interest in their capacity for processing dynamic graphs. Temporal motifs, as an elementary unit and important local property of dynamic graphs which can directly reflect anomalies and unique phenomena, are essential for understanding their evolutionary dynamics and structural features. However, leveraging LLMs for temporal motif analysis on dynamic graphs remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we systematically study LLM performance on temporal motif-related tasks. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive benchmark, LLMTM (Large Language Models in Temporal Motifs), which includes six tailored tasks across nine temporal motif types. We then conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impacts of different prompting techniques and LLMs (including nine models: openPangu-7B, the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and o3) on model performance. Informed by our benchmark findings, we develop a tool-augmented LLM agent that leverages precisely engineered prompts to solve these tasks with high accuracy. Nevertheless, the high accuracy of the agent incurs a substantial cost. To address this trade-off, we propose a simple yet effective structure-aware dispatcher that considers both the dynamic graph's structural properties and the LLM's cognitive load to intelligently dispatch queries between the standard LLM prompting and the more powerful agent. Our experiments demonstrate that the structure-aware dispatcher effectively maintains high accuracy while reducing cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrackNetV5: Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement and Motion Direction Decoupling for Fast Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02789v3)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.</p></details> |  |

Despite the advances in this field, the complex and stochastic nature of this task still poses challenges to existing approaches. Specifically, deterministic models tend to produce blurry predictions while generative models often struggle with poor accuracy. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective model architecture termed STLDM, a diffusion-based model that learns the latent representation from end to end alongside both the Variational Autoencoder and the conditioning network. STLDM decomposes this task into two stages: a deterministic forecasting stage handled by the conditioning network, and an enhancement stage performed by the latent diffusion model. Experimental results on multiple radar datasets demonstrate that STLDM achieves superior performance compared to the state of the art, while also improving inference efficiency.

During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term "internal RL", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails. Our results demonstrate the benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, suggesting internal RL as a promising avenue for realizing hierarchical RL within foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, extending this success to video editing remains challenging. Recent video editing efforts have adapted pretrained text-to-image models by adding temporal attention mechanisms to handle video tasks. Unfortunately, these methods continue to suffer from temporal inconsistency issues and high computational overheads. In this study, we propose FluencyVE, which is a simple yet effective one-shot video editing approach. FluencyVE integrates the linear time-series module, Mamba, into a video editing model based on pretrained Stable Diffusion models, replacing the temporal attention layer. This enables global frame-level attention while reducing the computational costs. In addition, we employ low-rank approximation matrices to replace the query and key weight matrices in the causal attention, and use a weighted averaging technique during training to update the attention scores. This approach significantly preserves the generative power of the text-to-image model while effectively reducing the computational burden. Experiments and analyses demonstrate promising results in editing various attributes, subjects, and locations in real-world videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |

However, traditional methods overlook the role of temporal semantic exploration in HMS. This paper explores the use of temporal vision semantics (TVS) derived from human motion sequences, leveraging the image-to-text capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to enhance subspace clustering performance. The core idea is to extract textual motion information from consecutive frames via LLM and incorporate this learned information into the subspace clustering framework. The primary challenge lies in learning TVS from human motion sequences using LLM and integrating this information into subspace clustering. To address this, we determine whether consecutive frames depict the same motion by querying the LLM and subsequently learn temporal neighboring information based on its response. We then develop a TVS-integrated subspace clustering approach, incorporating subspace embedding with a temporal regularizer that induces each frame to share similar subspace embeddings with its temporal neighbors. Additionally, segmentation is performed based on subspace embedding with a temporal constraint that induces the grouping of each frame with its temporal neighbors. We also introduce a feedback-enabled framework that continuously optimizes subspace embedding based on the segmentation output. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark human motion datasets.</p></details> |  |

This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes. As this research examined surface-laid mines where thermal contrast is maximized, future research should quantify thermal contrast effects for mines buried at varying depths across heterogeneous soil types.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages with 6 figures</p></details> |

We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Temporal Anomaly Causality Discovery in Large Systems: Achieving Computational Efficiency with Binary Anomaly Flag Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11800v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting anomaly causality facilitates diagnostics once monitoring systems detect system faults. Identifying anomaly causes in large systems involves investigating a broader set of monitoring variables across multiple subsystems. However, learning graphical causal models (GCMs) comes with a significant computational burden that restrains the applicability of most existing methods in real-time and large-scale deployments. In addition, modern monitoring applications for large systems often generate large amounts of binary alarm flags, and the distinct characteristics of binary anomaly data -- the meaning of state transition and data sparsity -- challenge existing causality learning mechanisms. This study proposes an anomaly causal discovery approach (AnomalyCD), addressing the accuracy and computational challenges of generating GCMs from temporal binary flag datasets. The AnomalyCD presents several strategies, such as anomaly data-aware causality testing, sparse data and prior link compression, and edge pruning adjustment approaches. We validate the performance of the approach on two datasets: monitoring sensor data from the readout-box system of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at CERN, and a public dataset from an information technology monitoring system. The results on temporal GCMs demonstrate a considerable reduction of computation overhead and a moderate enhancement of accuracy on the binary anomaly datasets Source code: https://github.com/muleina/AnomalyCD .</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 17 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Although many existing methods utilize multi-head attention mechanisms and message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture both spatial and temporal relations, these approaches encode temporal and spatial relations independently, and reflect the graph's topological characteristics in a limited manner. In this work, we introduce the Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer), a novel spatio-temporal GNN based on topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks based on MLPs: A temporal block for capturing temporal properties, a message-passing block for encapsulating spatial information, and a cycle message-passing block for enriching topological information through cyclic subgraphs. We bolster the effectiveness of Cy2Mixer with mathematical evidence emphasizing that our cycle message-passing block is capable of offering differentiated information to the deep learning model compared to the message-passing block. Furthermore, empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy of the Cy2Mixer, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances across various spatio-temporal benchmark datasets.

However, existing works and our pilot study have shown that as dialogue histories grow in length and accumulate noise, current long-context models struggle to accurately identify temporally pertinent information, significantly impairing reasoning performance. To address this, we introduce Memory-T1, a framework that learns a time-aware memory selection policy using reinforcement learning (RL). It employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, first pruning the dialogue history into a candidate set using temporal and relevance filters, followed by an RL agent that selects the precise evidence sessions. The RL training is guided by a multi-level reward function optimizing (i) answer accuracy, (ii) evidence grounding, and (iii) temporal consistency. In particular, the temporal consistency reward provides a dense signal by evaluating alignment with the query time scope at both the session-level (chronological proximity) and the utterance-level (chronological fidelity), enabling the agent to resolve subtle chronological ambiguities. On the Time-Dialog benchmark, Memory-T1 boosts a 7B model to an overall score of 67.0\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for open-source models and outperforming a 14B baseline by 10.2\%. Ablation studies show temporal consistency and evidence grounding rewards jointly contribute to a 15.0\% performance gain. Moreover, Memory-T1 maintains robustness up to 128k tokens, where baseline models collapse, proving effectiveness against noise in extensive dialogue histories. The code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/Elvin-Yiming-Du/Memory-T1/</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Graphs Beyond Grids: Benchmark for Maritime Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20086v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) have achieved notable success in structured domains such as road traffic and public transportation, where spatial entities can be naturally represented as fixed nodes. In contrast, many real-world systems including maritime traffic lack such fixed anchors, making the construction of spatio-temporal graphs a fundamental challenge. Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies. We plan to employ two specialized LLM-based agents: \emph{Trajectory Synthesizer} and \emph{Anomaly Injector} to construct richer interaction contexts and generate semantically meaningful anomalies. We expect this benchmark to promote reproducibility and to foster methodological advances in anomaly detection for non-grid spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop in AI for Science: The Reach and Limits of AI for Scientific Discovery</p></details> |

However, current thermal infrared satellite sensors cannot simultaneously achieve high spatial and temporal resolution. Spatio-temporal fusion (STF) techniques address this limitation by combining complementary satellite data, one with high spatial but low temporal resolution, and another with high temporal but low spatial resolution. Existing STF techniques, from classical models to modern deep learning (DL) architectures, were primarily developed for surface reflectance (SR). Their application to thermal data remains limited and often overlooks LST-specific spatial and temporal variability. This study provides a focused review of DL-based STF methods for LST. We present a formal mathematical definition of the thermal fusion task, propose a refined taxonomy of relevant DL methods, and analyze the modifications required when adapting SR-oriented models to LST. To support reproducibility and benchmarking, we introduce a new dataset comprising 51 Terra MODIS-Landsat LST pairs from 2013 to 2024, and evaluate representative models to explore their behavior on thermal data. The analysis highlights performance gaps, architecture sensitivities, and open research challenges. The dataset and accompanying resources are publicly available at https://github.com/Sofianebouaziz1/STF-LST.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Coordinated Activities Through Temporal, Multiplex, and Collaborative Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19677v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of widespread online content consumption, effective detection of coordinated efforts is crucial for mitigating potential threats arising from information manipulation. Despite advances in isolating inauthentic and automated actors, the actions of individual accounts involved in influence campaigns may not stand out as anomalous if analyzed independently of the coordinated group. Given the collaborative nature of information operations, coordinated campaigns are better characterized by evidence of similar temporal behavioral patterns that extend beyond coincidental synchronicity across a group of accounts. We propose a framework to model complex coordination patterns across multiple online modalities. This framework utilizes multiplex networks to first decompose online activities into different interaction layers, and subsequently aggregate evidence of online coordination across the layers. In addition, we propose a time-aware collaboration model to capture patterns of online coordination for each modality. The proposed time-aware model builds upon the node-normalized collaboration model and accounts for repetitions of coordinated actions over different time intervals by employing an exponential decay temporal kernel. We validate our approach on multiple datasets featuring different coordinated activities. Our results demonstrate that a multiplex time-aware model excels in the identification of coordinating groups, outperforming previously proposed methods in coordinated activity detection.</p></details> |  |

We present ActAvatar, a framework that achieves phase-level precision in action control through textual guidance by capturing both action semantics and temporal context. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) Phase-Aware Cross-Attention (PACA), which decomposes prompts into a global base block and temporally-anchored phase blocks, enabling the model to concentrate on phase-relevant tokens for precise temporal-semantic alignment; (2) Progressive Audio-Visual Alignment, which aligns modality influence with the hierarchical feature learning process-early layers prioritize text for establishing action structure while deeper layers emphasize audio for refining lip movements, preventing modality interference; (3) A two-stage training strategy that first establishes robust audio-visual correspondence on diverse data, then injects action control through fine-tuning on structured annotations, maintaining both audio-visual alignment and the model's text-following capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActAvatar significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both action control and visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ziqiaopeng.github.io/ActAvatar/</p></details> |
| **[DK-STN: A Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network Model for MJO Forecast](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19506v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is fundamental for precipitation forecasting and disaster prevention. To date, long-term and accurate MJO prediction has remained a challenge for researchers. Conventional MJO prediction methods using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and highly unstable (most NWP methods are sensitive to seasons, with better MJO forecast results in winter). While existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods save resources and speed forecasting, their accuracy never reaches the 28 days predicted by the state-of-the-art NWP method, i.e., the operational forecasts from ECMWF, since neural networks cannot handle climate data effectively. In this paper, we present a Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network (DK-STN), a stable neural network model for accurate and efficient MJO forecasting. It combines the benefits of NWP and ANN methods and successfully improves the forecast accuracy of ANN methods while maintaining a high level of efficiency and stability. We begin with a spatial-temporal network (STN) and embed domain knowledge in it using two key methods: (i) applying a domain knowledge enhancement method and (ii) integrating a domain knowledge processing method into network training. We evaluated DK-STN with the 5th generation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and compared it with ECMWF. Given 7 days of climate data as input, DK-STN can generate reliable forecasts for the following 28 days in 1-2 seconds, with an error of only 2-3 days in different seasons. DK-STN significantly exceeds ECMWF in that its forecast accuracy is equivalent to ECMWF's, while its efficiency and stability are significantly superior.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

In this paper we propose a new interpretation of SEMs when reasoning about Actual Causality, in which SEMs are viewed as mechanisms transforming the dynamics of exogenous variables into the dynamics of endogenous variables. This allows us to combine counterfactual causal reasoning with existing temporal logic formalisms, and to introduce a temporal logic, CPLTL, for causal reasoning about such structures. We show that the standard restriction to so-called \textit{recursive} models (with no cycles in the dependency graph) is not necessary in our approach, allowing us to reason about mutually dependent processes and feedback loops. Finally, we introduce new notions of model equivalence for temporal causal models, and show that CPLTL has an efficient model-checking procedure.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of the same title paper published in the proceeding of AAAI-25 conference (Gladyshev et al. 2025).

| **[DSTED: Decoupling Temporal Stabilization and Discriminative Enhancement for Surgical Workflow Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19387v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Surgical workflow recognition enables context-aware assistance and skill assessment in computer-assisted interventions. Despite recent advances, current methods suffer from two critical challenges: prediction jitter across consecutive frames and poor discrimination of ambiguous phases. This paper aims to develop a stable framework by selectively propagating reliable historical information and explicitly modeling uncertainty for hard sample enhancement. Methods: We propose a dual-pathway framework DSTED with Reliable Memory Propagation (RMP) and Uncertainty-Aware Prototype Retrieval (UPR). RMP maintains temporal coherence by filtering and fusing high-confidence historical features through multi-criteria reliability assessment. UPR constructs learnable class-specific prototypes from high-uncertainty samples and performs adaptive prototype matching to refine ambiguous frame representations. Finally, a confidence-driven gate dynamically balances both pathways based on prediction certainty. Results: Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AutoLaparo-hysterectomy with 84.36% accuracy and 65.51% F1-score, surpassing the second-best method by 3.51% and 4.88% respectively. Ablations reveal complementary gains from RMP (2.19%) and UPR (1.93%), with synergistic effects when combined. Extensive analysis confirms substantial reduction in temporal jitter and marked improvement on challenging phase transitions. Conclusion: Our dual-pathway design introduces a novel paradigm for stable workflow recognition, demonstrating that decoupling the modeling of temporal consistency and phase ambiguity yields superior performance and clinical applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early accepted to IPCAI 2026</p></details> |

As sensor networks grow in scale and complexity, identifying the most informative sensors becomes essential to reduce deployment costs without compromising monitoring quality. While Graph Signal Processing (GSP) has shown promise by leveraging spatial correlations among sensor nodes, conventional approaches often overlook the temporal dynamics of structural behavior. To overcome this limitation, we propose Time-Vertex Machine Learning (TVML), a novel framework that integrates GSP, time-domain analysis, and machine learning to enable interpretable and efficient sensor placement by identifying representative nodes that minimize redundancy while preserving critical information. We evaluate the proposed approach on two bridge datasets for damage detection and time-varying graph signal reconstruction tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing SHM systems by providing a robust, adaptive, and efficient solution for sensor placement.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often suffer from computational inefficiency or suboptimal performance due to joint modeling of temporal and speaker interactions. We propose D$^{2}$Stream, a decoupled dual-stream framework that separates cross-frame temporal modeling from within-frame speaker discrimination. Audio and visual features are first aligned via cross-modal attention, then fed into two lightweight streams: a Temporal Interaction Stream captures long-range temporal dependencies, while a Speaker Interaction Stream models per-frame inter-person relationships. The temporal and relational features extracted by the two streams interact via cross-attention to enrich representations. A lightweight Voice Gate module further mitigates false positives from non-speech facial movements. On AVA-ActiveSpeaker, D$^{2}$Stream achieves a new state-of-the-art at 95.6% mAP, with 80% reduction in computation compared to GNN-based models and 30% fewer parameters than attention-based alternatives, while also generalizing well on Columbia ASD.

Deep learning-based watermarking has improved robustness to diffusion-based image editing, but a gap remains when a watermarked image is converted to video by image-to-video (I2V), in which per-frame watermark detection weakens. I2V has quickly advanced from short, jittery clips to multi-second, temporally coherent scenes, and it now serves not only content creation but also world-modeling and simulation workflows, making cross-modal watermark recovery crucial. We present WaTeRFlow, a framework tailored for robustness under I2V. It consists of (i) FUSE (Flow-guided Unified Synthesis Engine), which exposes the encoder-decoder to realistic distortions via instruction-driven edits and a fast video diffusion proxy during training, (ii) optical-flow warping with a Temporal Consistency Loss (TCL) that stabilizes per-frame predictions, and (iii) a semantic preservation loss that maintains the conditioning signal. Experiments across representative I2V models show accurate watermark recovery from frames, with higher first-frame and per-frame bit accuracy and resilience when various distortions are applied before or after video generation.</p></details> |  |

Automatic and precise detection of behaviorally relevant neuron activity from the recordings is critical to study the mapping of brain activity in organisms. However a perpetual bottleneck to this problem is the manual segmentation which is time and labor intensive and lacks generalizability. To this end, we present a Bayesian Deep Learning Framework to detect neuronal activities in 4D spatio-temporal data obtained by light sheet microscopy. Our approach accounts for the use of temporal information by calculating pixel wise correlation maps and combines it with spatial information given by the mean summary image. The Bayesian framework not only produces probability segmentation maps but also models the uncertainty pertaining to active neuron detection. To evaluate the accuracy of our framework we implemented the test of reproducibility to assert the generalization of the network to detect neuron activity. The network achieved a mean Dice Score of 0.81 relative to the synthetic Ground Truth obtained by Otsu's method and a mean Dice Score of 0.79 between the first and second run for test of reproducibility. Our method successfully deployed can be used for rapid detection of active neuronal activities for behavioural studies.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often overlook the multi-granularity nature of actions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Context-Aware Network (CAN). CAN consists of two core modules: the Multi-scale Temporal Cue Module (MTCM) and the Group Spatial Cue Module (GSCM). MTCM effectively extracts temporal cues at multiple scales, capturing both fast-changing motion details and overall action flow. GSCM, on the other hand, extracts spatial cues at different scales by grouping feature maps and applying specialized extraction methods to each group. Experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets (Something-Something V1 and V2, Diving48, Kinetics-400, and UCF101) demonstrate the effectiveness of CAN. Our approach achieves competitive performance, outperforming most mainstream methods, with accuracies of 50.4% on Something-Something V1, 63.9% on Something-Something V2, 88.4% on Diving48, 74.9% on Kinetics-400, and 86.9% on UCF101.

A critical component of disease behavior is the velocity with which disease spreads, defined as the rate of change between time and space. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal modeling approach to determine the velocities of infectious disease spread. Our approach assumes that the locations and times of people infected can be considered as a spatio-temporal point pattern that arises as a realization of a spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox process. The intensity of this process is estimated using fast Bayesian inference by employing the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approaches. The velocity is then calculated using finite differences that approximate the derivatives of the intensity function. Finally, the directions and magnitudes of the velocities can be mapped at specific times to examine better the spread of the disease throughout the region. We demonstrate our method by analyzing COVID-19 spread in Cali, Colombia, during the 2020-2021 pandemic.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 46 figures, Journal American Statistican, submitted on 3rd of September</p></details> |

While several methods for hallucination mitigation have been proposed, they often compromise the model's capacity for video understanding and reasoning. In this work, we propose SmartSight, a pioneering step to address this issue in a training-free manner by leveraging the model's own introspective capabilities. Specifically, SmartSight generates multiple candidate responses to uncover low-hallucinated outputs that are often obscured by standard greedy decoding. It assesses the hallucination of each response using the Temporal Attention Collapse score, which measures whether the model over-focuses on trivial temporal regions of the input video when generating the response. To improve efficiency, SmartSight identifies the Visual Attention Vanishing point, enabling more accurate hallucination estimation and early termination of hallucinated responses, leading to a substantial reduction in decoding cost. Experiments show that SmartSight substantially lowers hallucinations for Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 10.59% on VRIPT-HAL, while simultaneously enhancing video understanding and reasoning, boosting performance on VideoMMMU by up to 8.86%. These results highlight SmartSight's effectiveness in improving the reliability of open-source Video-LLMs.</p></details> | AAAI26 accepted |

Conventional approaches, relying exclusively on historical price sequences, often neglect the semantic drivers of volatility such as policy uncertainty and market narratives. To address these limitations, we propose the ASTIF (Adaptive Semantic-Temporal Integration for Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting), a hybrid intelligent system that adapts its forecasting strategy in real time through confidence-based meta-learning. The framework integrates three complementary components. A dual-channel Small Language Model using MirrorPrompt extracts semantic market cues alongside numerical trends. A hybrid LSTM Random Forest model captures sequential temporal dependencies. A confidence-aware meta-learner functions as an adaptive inference layer, modulating each predictor's contribution based on its real-time uncertainty. Experimental evaluation on a diverse dataset of AI-focused cryptocurrencies and major technology stocks from 2020 to 2024 shows that ASTIF outperforms leading deep learning and Transformer baselines (e.g., Informer, TFT). The ablation studies further confirm the critical role of the adaptive meta-learning mechanism, which successfully mitigates risk by shifting reliance between semantic and temporal channels during market turbulence. The research contributes a scalable, knowledge-based solution for fusing quantitative and qualitative data in non-stationary environments.</p></details> | 33 Pages, 8 Figures |
| **[A Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network for City-Scale Dynamic Logistics Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18441v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>City-scale logistics routing has become increasingly challenging as metropolitan road networks grow to tens of millions of edges and traffic conditions evolve rapidly under high-volume mobility demands. Conventional centralized routing algorithms and monolithic graph neural network (GNN) models suffer from limited scalability, high latency, and poor real-time adaptability, which restricts their effectiveness in large urban logistics systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network (HSTE-GNN) for dynamic routing over ultra-large road networks. The framework partitions the city-scale graph into regional subgraphs processed in parallel across distributed computing nodes, enabling efficient learning of localized traffic dynamics. Within each region, an edge-enhanced spatio-temporal module jointly models node states, dynamic edge attributes, and short-term temporal dependencies. A hierarchical coordination layer further aggregates cross-region representations through an asynchronous parameter-server mechanism, ensuring global routing coherence under high-frequency traffic updates. This distributed hierarchical design balances local responsiveness with global consistency, significantly improving scalability and inference efficiency. Experiments on real-world large-scale traffic datasets from Beijing and New York demonstrate that HSTE-GNN outperforms strong spatio-temporal baselines such as ST-GRAPH, achieving 34.9% lower routing delay, 14.7% lower MAPE, and 11.8% lower RMSE, while improving global route consistency by 7.3%. These results confirm that the proposed framework provides a scalable, adaptive, and efficient solution for next-generation intelligent transportation systems and large-scale logistics platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Drift in Privacy Recall: Users Misremember From Verbatim Loss to Gist-Based Overexposure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16962v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With social media content traversing the different platforms, occasionally resurfacing after periods of time, users are increasingly prone to unintended disclosure resulting from a misremembered acceptance of privacy. Context collapse and interface cues are two factors considered by prior researchers, yet we know less about how time-lapse basically alters recall of past audiences destined for exposure. Likewise, the design space for mitigating this temporal exposure risk remains underexplored. Our work theorizes temporal drift in privacy recall as verbatim memory of prior settings blowing apart and eventually settling with gist-based heuristics, which more often than not select an audience larger than the original one. Grounded in memory research, contextual integrity, and usable privacy, we examine why such a drift occurs, why it tends to bias toward broader sharing, and how it compounds upon repeat exposure. Following that, we suggest provenance-forward interface schemes and a risk-based evaluation framework that mutates recall into recognition. The merit of our work lies in establishing a temporal awareness of privacy design as an essential safety rail against inadvertent overexposure.</p></details> |  |

While Gaussian processes offer theoretical consistency and exact uncertainty quantification, their prohibitive computational scaling renders them impractical for massive sensor networks. Conversely, modern transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling but inherently lack a geometric inductive bias, treating spatial sensors as permutation-invariant tokens without a native understanding of distance. In this work, we propose a spatially-informed transformer, a hybrid architecture that injects a geostatistical inductive bias directly into the self-attention mechanism via a learnable covariance kernel. By formally decomposing the attention structure into a stationary physical prior and a non-stationary data-driven residual, we impose a soft topological constraint that favors spatially proximal interactions while retaining the capacity to model complex dynamics. We demonstrate the phenomenon of ``Deep Variography'', where the network successfully recovers the true spatial decay parameters of the underlying process end-to-end via backpropagation. Extensive experiments on synthetic Gaussian random fields and real-world traffic benchmarks confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks. Furthermore, rigorous statistical validation confirms that the proposed method delivers not only superior predictive accuracy but also well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts, effectively bridging the gap between physics-aware modeling and data-driven learning.</p></details> |  |

However, since models must capture both spatial and temporal relationships, performance is limited by the feature representations within a frame but also between multiple frames. We propose the Spatio-Temporal Gaze Network (ST-Gaze), a model that combines a CNN backbone with dedicated channel attention and self-attention modules to fuse eye and face features optimally. The fused features are then treated as a spatial sequence, allowing for the capture of an intra-frame context, which is then propagated through time to model inter-frame dynamics. We evaluated our method on the EVE dataset and show that ST-Gaze achieves state-of-the-art performance both with and without person-specific adaptation. Additionally, our ablation study provides further insights into the model performance, showing that preserving and modelling intra-frame spatial context with our spatio-temporal recurrence is fundamentally superior to premature spatial pooling. As such, our results pave the way towards more robust video-based gaze estimation using commonly available cameras.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, the code repository is available at https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/u0172623/ST-Gaze</p></details> |

We achieve this by using a sliding time window with short strides and consider the temporal dimension by storing convolution results between passes. This allows us to ignore unchanged regions, significantly reducing the number of convolution operations per forward pass without sacrificing accuracy. This data reuse scheme introduces extreme sparsity to detection data. To exploit this sparsity, we extend our previous work on scatter-based convolutions to allow for data reuse, and as such propose Sparse Scatter-Based Convolution Algorithm with Temporal Data Recycling (SSCATeR). This operation treats incoming LiDAR data as a continuous stream and acts only on the changing parts of the point cloud. By doing so, we achieve the same results with as much as a 6.61-fold reduction in processing time. Our test results show that the feature maps output by our method are identical to those produced by traditional sparse convolution techniques, whilst greatly increasing the computational efficiency of the network.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages, 27 Figures, This work has been submitted to the IEEE Sensors Journal for possible publication</p></details> |

Sparse query-based 3D detectors efficiently aggregate object-relevant features from multi-view images through a set of learnable queries, offering a concise and end-to-end detection paradigm. Building on this foundation, MV2D leverages 2D detection results to provide high-quality object priors for query initialization, enabling higher precision and recall. However, the inherent depth ambiguity in single-frame 2D detections still limits the accuracy of 3D query generation. To address this issue, we propose StereoMV2D, a unified framework that integrates temporal stereo modeling into the 2D detection-guided multi-view 3D detector. By exploiting cross-temporal disparities of the same object across adjacent frames, StereoMV2D enhances depth perception and refines the query priors, while performing all computations efficiently within 2D regions of interest (RoIs). Furthermore, a dynamic confidence gating mechanism adaptively evaluates the reliability of temporal stereo cues through learning statistical patterns derived from the inter-frame matching matrix together with appearance consistency, ensuring robust detection under object appearance and occlusion. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that StereoMV2D achieves superior detection performance without incurring significant computational overhead.

The temporal module applies trend-seasonal decomposition, while the spatial module performs message passing with low-rank Top-$K$ adjacency learning and conservative horizon-wise gating, enabling spatial corrections that enhance a strong linear baseline. Lite-STGNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on four benchmark datasets for horizons up to 720 steps, while being parameter-efficient and substantially faster to train than transformer-based methods. Ablation studies show that the spatial module yields 4.6% improvement over the temporal baseline, Top-$K$ enhances locality by 3.3%, and learned adjacency matrices reveal domain-specific interaction dynamics. Lite-STGNN thus offers a compact, interpretable, and efficient framework for long-term multivariate time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Foundation for unbiased cross-validation of spatio-temporal models for species distribution modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03480v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the predictive performance of species distribution models (SDMs) under realistic deployment scenarios requires careful handling of spatial and temporal dependencies in the data. Cross-validation (CV) is the standard approach for model evaluation, but its design strongly influences the validity of performance estimates. When SDMs are intended for spatial or temporal transfer, random CV can lead to overoptimistic results due to spatial autocorrelation (SAC) among neighboring observations. We benchmark four machine learning algorithms (GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest) on two real-world presence-absence datasets, a temperate plant and an anadromous fish, using multiple CV designs: random, spatial, spatio-temporal, environmental, and forward-chaining. Two training data usage strategies (LAST FOLD and RETRAIN) are evaluated, with hyperparameter tuning performed within each CV scheme. Model performance is assessed on independent out-of-time test sets using AUC, MAE, and correlation metrics. Random CV overestimates AUC by up to 0.16 and produces MAE values up to 80 percent higher than spatially blocked alternatives. Blocking at the empirical SAC range substantially reduces this bias. Training strategy affects evaluation outcomes: LAST FOLD yields smaller validation-test discrepancies under strong SAC, while RETRAIN achieves higher test AUC when SAC is weaker. Boosted ensemble models consistently perform best under spatially structured CV designs. We recommend a robust SDM workflow based on SAC-aware blocking, blocked hyperparameter tuning, and external temporal validation to improve reliability under spatial and temporal shifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted manuscript.

Existing anomaly detection methods are ill-suited for this challenge: mean-pooling embeddings dilutes anomalous steps, while contrastive-only approaches ignore sequential structure. Standard unsupervised methods on pre-trained embeddings achieve F1-scores no higher than 0.69. We introduce Trajectory Guard, a Siamese Recurrent Autoencoder with a hybrid loss function that jointly learns task-trajectory alignment via contrastive learning and sequential validity via reconstruction. This dual objective enables unified detection of both "wrong plan for this task" and "malformed plan structure." On benchmarks spanning synthetic perturbations and real-world failures from security audits (RAS-Eval) and multi-agent systems (Who\&When), we achieve F1-scores of 0.88-0.94 on balanced sets and recall of 0.86-0.92 on imbalanced external benchmarks. At 32 ms inference latency, our approach runs 17-27$\times$ faster than LLM Judge baselines, enabling real-time safety verification in production deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI Trustagent 2026</p></details> |
| **[Imitation from Observations with Trajectory-Level Generative Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00452v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the offline imitation learning from observations (LfO) where the expert demonstrations are scarce and the available offline suboptimal data are far from the expert behavior. Many existing distribution-matching approaches struggle in this regime because they impose strict support constraints and rely on brittle one-step models, making it hard to extract useful signal from imperfect data. To tackle this challenge, we propose TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding for offline LfO that constructs a dense, smooth surrogate reward by estimating expert state density in the latent space of a temporal diffusion model trained on offline trajectory data. By leveraging the smooth geometry of the learned diffusion embedding, TGE captures long-horizon temporal dynamics and effectively bridges the gap between disjoint supports, ensuring a robust learning signal even when offline data is distributionally distinct from the expert. Empirically, the proposed approach consistently matches or outperforms prior offline LfO methods across a range of D4RL locomotion and manipulation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Clustering Approach for Basket Trials Based on Treatment Response Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09890v2)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneity in efficacy is sometimes observed across baskets in basket trials. In this study, we propose a model-free clustering framework that groups baskets based on transition probabilities derived from the trajectories of treatment response, rather than relying solely on a single efficacy endpoint such as the objective response rate. The number of clusters is not predetermined but is automatically determined in a data-driven manner based on the similarity structure among baskets. After clustering, baskets within the same cluster are analyzed using a hierarchical Bayesian model. This framework aims to improve the estimation precision of efficacy endpoints and enhance statistical power while maintaining the type~I error rate at the nominal level. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated through simulation studies. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can accurately identify cluster structures in heterogeneous settings and, even under such conditions, maintain the type~I error rate at the nominal level while improving statistical power.</p></details> |  |

Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures.

In this paper, we enhance high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline. Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.</p></details> |  |

To address these, we first present the EgoMAN dataset, a large-scale egocentric dataset for interaction stage-aware 3D hand trajectory prediction with 219K 6DoF trajectories and 3M structured QA pairs for semantic, spatial, and motion reasoning. We then introduce the EgoMAN model, a reasoning-to-motion framework that links vision-language reasoning and motion generation via a trajectory-token interface. Trained progressively to align reasoning with motion dynamics, our approach yields accurate and stage-aware trajectories with generalization across real-world scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://egoman-project.github.io</p></details> |
| **[OSVI-WM: One-Shot Visual Imitation for Unseen Tasks using World-Model-Guided Trajectory Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20425v2)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual imitation learning enables robotic agents to acquire skills by observing expert demonstration videos. In the one-shot setting, the agent generates a policy after observing a single expert demonstration without additional fine-tuning. Existing approaches typically train and evaluate on the same set of tasks, varying only object configurations, and struggle to generalize to unseen tasks with different semantic or structural requirements. While some recent methods attempt to address this, they exhibit low success rates on hard test tasks that, despite being visually similar to some training tasks, differ in context and require distinct responses. Additionally, most existing methods lack an explicit model of environment dynamics, limiting their ability to reason about future states. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for one-shot visual imitation learning via world-model-guided trajectory generation. Given an expert demonstration video and the agent's initial observation, our method leverages a learned world model to predict a sequence of latent states and actions. This latent trajectory is then decoded into physical waypoints that guide the agent's execution. Our method is evaluated on two simulated benchmarks and three real-world robotic platforms, where it consistently outperforms prior approaches, with over 30% improvement in some cases. The code is available at https://github.com/raktimgg/osvi-wm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimization-Based Dynamic PID Tuning for Accurate and Robust UAV Trajectory Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24249v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play an important role in various applications, where precise trajectory tracking is crucial. However, conventional control algorithms for trajectory tracking often exhibit limited performance due to the underactuated, nonlinear, and highly coupled dynamics of quadrotor systems. To address these challenges, we propose HBO-PID, a novel control algorithm that integrates the Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimization (HBO) framework with the classical PID controller to achieve accurate and robust trajectory tracking. By explicitly modeling input-dependent noise variance, the proposed method can better adapt to dynamic and complex environments, and therefore improve the accuracy and robustness of trajectory tracking. To accelerate the convergence of optimization, we adopt a two-stage optimization strategy that allow us to more efficiently find the optimal controller parameters. Through experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Compared to SOTA methods, it improves the position accuracy by 24.7% to 42.9%, and the angular accuracy by 40.9% to 78.4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025 (2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems)</p></details> |
| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v3)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRelay: A Universal Spatio-Temporal Relaying Framework for Location Prediction over Human Trajectory Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16620v2)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next location prediction is a critical task in human mobility modeling, enabling applications like travel planning and urban mobility management. Existing methods mainly rely on historical spatiotemporal trajectory data to train sequence models that directly forecast future locations. However, they often overlook the importance of the future spatiotemporal contexts, which are highly informative for the future locations. For example, knowing how much time and distance a user will travel could serve as a critical clue for predicting the user's next location. Against this background, we propose \textbf{STRelay}, a universal \textbf{\underline{S}}patio\textbf{\underline{T}}emporal \textbf{\underline{Relay}}ing framework explicitly modeling the future spatiotemporal context given a human trajectory, to boost the performance of different location prediction models. Specifically, STRelay models future spatiotemporal contexts in a relaying manner, which is subsequently integrated with the encoded historical representation from a base location prediction model, enabling multi-task learning by simultaneously predicting the next time interval, next moving distance interval, and finally the next location. We evaluate STRelay integrated with five state-of-the-art location prediction base models on four real-world trajectory datasets. Results demonstrate that STRelay consistently improves prediction performance across all cases by 2.49\%-11.30\%. Additionally, we find that the future spatiotemporal contexts are particularly helpful for entertainment-related locations and also for user groups who prefer traveling longer distances. The performance gain on such non-daily-routine activities, which often suffer from higher uncertainty, is indeed complementary to the base location prediction models that often excel at modeling regular daily routine patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[SURE Guided Posterior Sampling: Trajectory Correction for Diffusion-Based Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23232v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful learned priors for solving inverse problems. However, current iterative solving approaches which alternate between diffusion sampling and data consistency steps typically require hundreds or thousands of steps to achieve high quality reconstruction due to accumulated errors. We address this challenge with SURE Guided Posterior Sampling (SGPS), a method that corrects sampling trajectory deviations using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) gradient updates and PCA based noise estimation. By mitigating noise induced errors during the critical early and middle sampling stages, SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling and reduces error accumulation. This allows our method to maintain high reconstruction quality with fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs). Our extensive evaluation across diverse inverse problems demonstrates that SGPS consistently outperforms existing methods at low NFE counts.</p></details> |  |

While repair-based methods fail to restore complex artifacts and LiDAR-based approaches rely on sparse and incomplete cues, ReCamDriving leverages dense and scene-complete 3DGS renderings for explicit geometric guidance, achieving precise camera-controllable generation. To mitigate overfitting to restoration behaviors when conditioned on 3DGS renderings, ReCamDriving adopts a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage uses camera poses for coarse control, while the second stage incorporates 3DGS renderings for fine-grained viewpoint and geometric guidance. Furthermore, we present a 3DGS-based cross-trajectory data curation strategy to eliminate the train-test gap in camera transformation patterns, enabling scalable multi-trajectory supervision from monocular videos. Based on this strategy, we construct the ParaDrive dataset, containing over 110K parallel-trajectory video pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCamDriving achieves state-of-the-art camera controllability and structural consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://recamdriving.github.io/</p></details> |

While consistency models offer a potential solution, existing applications to decision-making either struggle with suboptimal demonstrations under behavior cloning or rely on complex concurrent training of multiple networks under the actor-critic framework. In this work, we propose a novel approach to consistency distillation for offline reinforcement learning that directly incorporates reward optimization into the distillation process. Our method achieves single-step sampling while generating higher-reward action trajectories through decoupled training and noise-free reward signals. Empirical evaluations on the Gym MuJoCo, FrankaKitchen, and long horizon planning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach can achieve a 9.7% improvement over previous state-of-the-art while offering up to 142x speedup over diffusion counterparts in inference time.</p></details> |  |

We introduce NicheFlow, a flow-based generative model that infers the temporal trajectory of cellular microenvironments across sequential spatial slides. By representing local cell neighborhoods as point clouds, NicheFlow jointly models the evolution of cell states and spatial coordinates using optimal transport and Variational Flow Matching.

However, efficiently modeling the dynamic interactions between numerous road users and infrastructures in complex scenes remains an open problem. Existing methods typically employ distance-based or fully connected dense graph structures to capture interaction information, which not only introduces a large number of redundant edges but also requires complex and heavily parameterized networks for encoding, thereby resulting in low training and inference efficiency, limiting scalability to large and complex traffic scenes. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose SparScene, a sparse graph learning framework designed for efficient and scalable traffic scene representation. Instead of relying on distance thresholds, SparScene leverages the lane graph topology to construct structure-aware sparse connections between agents and lanes, enabling efficient yet informative scene graph representation. SparScene adopts a lightweight graph encoder that efficiently aggregates agent-map and agent-agent interactions, yielding compact scene representations with substantially improved efficiency and scalability. On the motion prediction benchmark of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), SparScene achieves competitive performance with remarkable efficiency. It generates trajectories for more than 200 agents in a scene within 5 ms and scales to more than 5,000 agents and 17,000 lanes with merely 54 ms of inference time with a GPU memory of 2.9 GB, highlighting its superior scalability for large-scale traffic scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, considering the time-varying task criticality characteristics of diverse WBAN users and the dual mobility between WBAN users and UAV, we investigate the dynamic task offloading and UAV flight trajectory optimization problem to minimize the weighted average task completion time of all the WBAN users, under the constraint of UAV energy consumption. To tackle the problem, an embodied AI-enhanced IoMT edge computing framework is established. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical multi-scale Transformer-based user trajectory prediction model based on the users' historical trajectory traces captured by the embodied AI agent (i.e., UAV). Afterwards, a prediction-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that integrates predicted users' mobility information is designed for intelligently optimizing UAV flight trajectory and task offloading decisions. Real-word movement traces and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in comparison with the existing benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Discrete sensing strategies, including sensor arrays and distributed sensors, are broadly involved in tactile sensors across versatile applications. However, it remains a challenge to achieve high spatial resolution with self-decoupled capacity and insensitivity to other off-axis stimuli for stretchable tactile sensors.

Efficient Data Pruning for Large-scale Autonomous Driving Dataset via Trajectory Entropy Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19270v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting large-scale naturalistic driving data is essential for training robust autonomous driving planners. However, real-world datasets often contain a substantial amount of repetitive and low-value samples, which lead to excessive storage costs and bring limited benefits to policy learning. To address this issue, we propose an information-theoretic data pruning method that effectively reduces the training data volume without compromising model performance. Our approach evaluates the trajectory distribution information entropy of driving data and iteratively selects high-value samples that preserve the statistical characteristics of the original dataset in a model-agnostic manner. From a theoretical perspective, we show that maximizing trajectory entropy effectively constrains the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the pruned subset and the original data distribution, thereby maintaining generalization ability. Comprehensive experiments on the NuPlan benchmark with a large-scale imitation learning framework demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the dataset size by up to 40% while maintaining closed-loop performance. This work provides a lightweight and theoretically grounded approach for scalable data management and efficient policy learning in autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

To address these issues, we propose the FC-MIR framework: leveraging keyframe sampling and adaptive concatenation, it cuts visual redundancy to boost inference efficiency, while integrating state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs or fine-tuned models (e.g., Qwen3-VL) for trajectory summarization and intent prediction. We further expand task scope to explore generating post-prediction operations and search suggestions, and introduce a fine-grained metric to evaluate the practical utility of summaries, predictions, and suggestions. For rigorous assessment, we construct a UI trajectory dataset covering scenarios from UI-Agents (Agent-I) and real user interactions (Person-I). Experimental results show our compression method retains performance at 50%-60% compression rates; both closed-source and fine-tuned MLLMs demonstrate strong intent summarization, supporting potential lightweight on-device deployment. However, MLLMs still struggle with useful and "surprising" suggestions, leaving room for improvement. Finally, we deploy the framework in a real-world setting, integrating UI perception and UI-Agent proxies to lay a foundation for future progress in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Classification Network Guided Trajectory Planning for Four-Wheel Independent Steering Autonomous Parking Considering Obstacle Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18836v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Four-wheel Independent Steering (4WIS) vehicles have attracted increasing attention for their superior maneuverability. Human drivers typically choose to cross or drive over the low-profile obstacles (e.g., plastic bags) to efficiently navigate through narrow spaces, while existing planners neglect obstacle attributes, causing inefficiency or path-finding failures. To address this, we propose a trajectory planning framework integrating the 4WIS hybrid A* and Optimal Control Problem (OCP), in which the hybrid A* provides an initial path to enhance the OCP solution. Specifically, a multimodal classification network is introduced to assess scene complexity (hard/easy task) by fusing image and vehicle state data. For hard tasks, guided points are set to decompose complex tasks into local subtasks, improving the search efficiency of 4WIS hybrid A*. The multiple steering modes of 4WIS vehicles (Ackermann, diagonal, and zero-turn) are also incorporated into node expansion and heuristic designs. Moreover, a hierarchical obstacle handling strategy is designed to guide the node expansion considering obstacle attributes, i.e., 'non-traversable', 'crossable', and 'drive-over' obstacles. It allows crossing or driving over obstacles instead of the 'avoid-only' strategy, greatly enhancing success rates of pathfinding. We also design a logical constraint for the 'drive-over' obstacle by limiting its velocity to ensure safety. Furthermore, to address dynamic obstacles with motion uncertainty, we introduce a probabilistic risk field model, constructing risk-aware driving corridors that serve as linear collision constraints in OCP. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework's effectiveness in generating safe, efficient, and smooth trajectories for 4WIS vehicles, especially in constrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[CauTraj: A Causal-Knowledge-Guided Framework for Lane-Changing Trajectory Planning of Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18703v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the performance of trajectory planners for lane - changing vehicles is one of the key challenges in autonomous driving within human - machine mixed traffic. Most existing studies have not incorporated human drivers' prior knowledge when designing trajectory planning models. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel trajectory planning framework that integrates causal prior knowledge into the control process. Both longitudinal and lateral microscopic behaviors of vehicles are modeled to quantify interaction risk, and a staged causal graph is constructed to capture causal dependencies in lane-changing scenarios. Causal effects between the lane-changing vehicle and surrounding vehicles are then estimated using causal inference, including average causal effects (ATE) and conditional average treatment effects (CATE). These causal priors are embedded into a model predictive control (MPC) framework to enhance trajectory planning. The proposed approach is validated on naturalistic vehicle trajectory datasets. Experimental results show that: (1) causal inference provides interpretable and stable quantification of vehicle interactions; (2) individual causal effects reveal driver heterogeneity; and (3) compared with the baseline MPC, the proposed method achieves a closer alignment with human driving behaviors, reducing maximum trajectory deviation from 1.2 m to 0.2 m, lateral velocity fluctuation by 60%, and yaw angle variability by 50%. These findings provide methodological support for human-like trajectory planning and practical value for improving safety, stability, and realism in autonomous vehicle testing and traffic simulation platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for UAV-Based Smart Farming Using Imitation-Based Triple Deep Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18604v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising auxiliary platform for smart agriculture, capable of simultaneously performing weed detection, recognition, and data collection from wireless sensors. However, trajectory planning for UAV-based smart agriculture is challenging due to the high uncertainty of the environment, partial observations, and limited battery capacity of UAVs. To address these issues, we formulate the trajectory planning problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to solve it. Furthermore, we propose a novel imitation-based triple deep Q-network (ITDQN) algorithm, which employs an elite imitation mechanism to reduce exploration costs and utilizes a mediator Q-network over a double deep Q-network (DDQN) to accelerate and stabilize training and improve performance. Experimental results in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution. Moreover, our proposed ITDQN outperforms DDQN by 4.43\% in weed recognition rate and 6.94\% in data collection rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Commercial Vehicle Braking Optimization: A Robust SIFT-Trajectory Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18597v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A vision-based trajectory analysis solution is proposed to address the "zero-speed braking" issue caused by inaccurate Controller Area Network (CAN) signals in commercial vehicle Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) systems during low-speed operation. The algorithm utilizes the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier platform to process sequential video frames from a blind spot camera, employing self-adaptive Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)-enhanced Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) feature extraction and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)-Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) matching. This allows for precise classification of the vehicle's motion state (static, vibration, moving). Key innovations include 1) multiframe trajectory displacement statistics (5-frame sliding window), 2) a dual-threshold state decision matrix, and 3) OBD-II driven dynamic Region of Interest (ROI) configuration. The system effectively suppresses environmental interference and false detection of dynamic objects, directly addressing the challenge of low-speed false activation in commercial vehicle safety systems. Evaluation in a real-world dataset (32,454 video segments from 1,852 vehicles) demonstrates an F1-score of 99.96% for static detection, 97.78% for moving state recognition, and a processing delay of 14.2 milliseconds (resolution 704x576). The deployment on-site shows an 89% reduction in false braking events, a 100% success rate in emergency braking, and a fault rate below 5%.</p></details> | 5 figures,16 pages |
| **[Trajectory-Aware Eligibility Traces for Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11321v3)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy learning from multistep returns is crucial for sample-efficient reinforcement learning, but counteracting off-policy bias without exacerbating variance is challenging. Classically, off-policy bias is corrected in a per-decision manner: past temporal-difference errors are re-weighted by the instantaneous Importance Sampling (IS) ratio after each action via eligibility traces. Many off-policy algorithms rely on this mechanism, along with differing protocols for cutting the IS ratios to combat the variance of the IS estimator. Unfortunately, once a trace has been fully cut, the effect cannot be reversed. This has led to the development of credit-assignment strategies that account for multiple past experiences at a time. These trajectory-aware methods have not been extensively analyzed, and their theoretical justification remains uncertain. In this paper, we propose a multistep operator that can express both per-decision and trajectory-aware methods. We prove convergence conditions for our operator in the tabular setting, establishing the first guarantees for several existing methods as well as many new ones. Finally, we introduce Recency-Bounded Importance Sampling (RBIS), which leverages trajectory awareness to perform robustly across $λ$-values in an off-policy control task.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2023. 18 pages, 4 figures, 1 table.

| **[Surrogate Trajectories Along Probability Flows: Pseudo Markovian Alternative to Mori Zwanzig](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00015v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction techniques have emerged as a powerful paradigm across different fronts of scientific computing. Despite their success, the provided tools and methodologies remain limited if high-dimensional dynamical systems subject to initial uncertainty and/or stochastic noise are encountered; in particular if rare events are of interest. We address this open challenge by borrowing ideas from Mori-Zwanzig formalism and Chorin's optimal prediction method. The novelty of our work lies on employing time-dependent optimal projection of the dynamic on a desired set of resolved variables. We show several theoretical and numerical properties of our model reduction approach. In particular, we show that the devised surrogate trajectories are consistent with the probability flow of the full-order system. Furthermore, we identify the measure underlying the projection through polynomial chaos expansion technique. This allows us to efficiently compute the projection even for trajectories that are initiated on low probability events. Moreover, we investigate the introduced model-reduction error of the surrogate trajectories on a standard setup, characterizing the convergence behaviour of the scheme. Several numerical results highlight the computational advantages of the proposed scheme in comparison to Monte-Carlo and optimal prediction method. Through this framework, we demonstrate that by tracking the measure along with the consistent projection of the dynamic we are able to access accurate estimates of different statistics including observables conditional on a given initial configuration.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoE Pathfinder: Trajectory-driven Expert Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18425v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures used in large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks yet face practical challenges such as deployment complexity and low activation efficiency. Expert pruning has thus emerged as a promising solution to reduce computational overhead and simplify the deployment of MoE models. However, existing expert pruning approaches conventionally rely on local importance metrics and often apply uniform layer-wise pruning, leveraging only partial evaluation signals and overlooking the heterogeneous contributions of experts across layers. To address these limitations, we propose an expert pruning approach based on the trajectory of activated experts across layers, which treats MoE as a weighted computation graph and casts expert selection as a global optimal path planning problem. Within this framework, we integrate complementary importance signals from reconstruction error, routing probabilities, and activation strength at the trajectory level, which naturally yields non-uniform expert retention across layers. Experiments show that our approach achieves superior pruning performance on nearly all tasks compared with most existing approaches.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Joint UAV-UGV Positioning and Trajectory Planning via Meta A3C for Reliable Emergency Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22187v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) has been shown to be an effective method to establish communications in areas affected by disasters. However, ensuring good Quality of Services (QoS) while using as few UAVs as possible also requires optimal positioning and trajectory planning for UAVs and UGVs. This paper proposes a joint UAV-UGV-based positioning and trajectory planning framework for UAVs and UGVs deployment that guarantees optimal QoS for ground users. To model the UGVs' mobility, we introduce a road graph, which directs their movement along valid road segments and adheres to the road network constraints. To solve the sum rate optimization problem, we reformulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) incorporated with meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new environments and dynamic conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed Meta-A3C approach outperforms A3C and DDPG, delivering 13.1\% higher throughput and 49\% faster execution while meeting the QoS requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLaViDA: A Large Language Vision Driving Assistant for Explicit Reasoning and Enhanced Trajectory Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18211v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning is a fundamental yet challenging component of autonomous driving. End-to-end planners frequently falter under adverse weather, unpredictable human behavior, or complex road layouts, primarily because they lack strong generalization or few-shot capabilities beyond their training data. We propose LLaViDA, a Large Language Vision Driving Assistant that leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for object motion prediction, semantic grounding, and chain-of-thought reasoning for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. A two-stage training pipeline--supervised fine-tuning followed by Trajectory Preference Optimization (TPO)--enhances scene understanding and trajectory planning by injecting regression-based supervision, produces a powerful "VLM Trajectory Planner for Autonomous Driving." On the NuScenes benchmark, LLaViDA surpasses state-of-the-art end-to-end and other recent VLM/LLM-based baselines in open-loop trajectory planning task, achieving an average L2 trajectory error of 0.31 m and a collision rate of 0.10% on the NuScenes test set.

| **[Planning as Descent: Goal-Conditioned Latent Trajectory Synthesis in Learned Energy Landscapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17846v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Planning as Descent (PaD), a framework for offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning that grounds trajectory synthesis in verification. Instead of learning a policy or explicit planner, PaD learns a goal-conditioned energy function over entire latent trajectories, assigning low energy to feasible, goal-consistent futures. Planning is realized as gradient-based refinement in this energy landscape, using identical computation during training and inference to reduce train-test mismatch common in decoupled modeling pipelines. PaD is trained via self-supervised hindsight goal relabeling, shaping the energy landscape around the planning dynamics. At inference, multiple trajectory candidates are refined under different temporal hypotheses, and low-energy plans balancing feasibility and efficiency are selected. We evaluate PaD on OGBench cube manipulation tasks. When trained on narrow expert demonstrations, PaD achieves state-of-the-art 95\% success, strongly outperforming prior methods that peak at 68\%. Remarkably, training on noisy, suboptimal data further improves success and plan efficiency, highlighting the benefits of verification-driven planning. Our results suggest learning to evaluate and refine trajectories provides a robust alternative to direct policy learning for offline, reward-free planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Dataset of Individual Daily Trajectories for City-Scale Mobility Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17239v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban mobility data are indispensable for urban planning, transportation demand forecasting, pandemic modeling, and many other applications; however, individual mobile phone-derived Global Positioning System traces cannot generally be shared with third parties owing to severe re-identification risks. Aggregated records, such as origin-destination (OD) matrices, offer partial insights but fail to capture the key behavioral properties of daily human movement, limiting realistic city-scale analyses. This study presents a privacy-preserving synthetic mobility dataset that reconstructs daily trajectories from aggregated inputs. The proposed method integrates OD flows with two complementary behavioral constraints: (1) dwell-travel time quantiles that are available only as coarse summary statistics and (2) the universal law for the daily distribution of the number of visited locations. Embedding these elements in a multi-objective optimization framework enables the reproduction of realistic distributions of human mobility while ensuring that no personal identifiers are required. The proposed framework is validated in two contrasting regions of Japan: (1) the 23 special wards of Tokyo, representing a dense metropolitan environment; and (2) Fukuoka Prefecture, where urban and suburban mobility patterns coexist. The resulting synthetic mobility data reproduce dwell-travel time and visit frequency distributions with high fidelity, while deviations in OD consistency remain within the natural range of daily fluctuations. The results of this study establish a practical synthesis pathway under real-world constraints, providing governments, urban planners, and industries with scalable access to high-resolution mobility data for reliable analytics without the need for sensitive personal records, and supporting practical deployments in policy and commercial domains.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Tracing the Roots: Leveraging Temporal Dynamics in Diffusion Trajectories for Origin Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07449v3)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have transformed image synthesis through iterative denoising, by defining trajectories from noise to coherent data. While their capabilities are widely celebrated, a critical challenge remains unaddressed: ensuring responsible use by verifying whether an image originates from a model's training set, its novel generations or external sources. We introduce a framework that analyzes diffusion trajectories for this purpose. Specifically, we demonstrate that temporal dynamics across the entire trajectory allow for more robust classification and challenge the widely-adopted "Goldilocks zone" conjecture, which posits that membership inference is effective only within narrow denoising stages. More fundamentally, we expose critical flaws in current membership inference practices by showing that representative methods fail under distribution shifts or when model-generated data is present. For model attribution, we demonstrate a first white-box approach directly applicable to diffusion. Ultimately, we propose the unification of data provenance into a single, cohesive framework tailored to modern generative systems.</p></details> |  |

The resulting videos demonstrate not only temporal coherence but also emergent consistency, preserving object identity and scene despite temporary disappearance.

Existing real datasets fit real-world scenarios, capturing authentic road object behaviors, however, they typically lack precise ground-truth annotations. In contrast, synthetic datasets play a crucial role, allowing for the annotation of a large number of frames without additional costs or extra time. However, a general drawback of synthetic datasets is the lack of realistic vehicle motion, since trajectories are generated using AI models or rule-based systems. In this work, we introduce R3ST (Realistic 3D Synthetic Trajectories), a synthetic dataset that overcomes this limitation by generating a synthetic 3D environment and integrating real-world trajectories derived from SinD, a bird's-eye-view dataset recorded from drone footage. The proposed dataset closes the gap between synthetic data and realistic trajectories, advancing the research in trajectory forecasting of road vehicles, offering both accurate multimodal ground-truth annotations and authentic human-driven vehicle trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[dLITE: Differentiable Lighting-Informed Trajectory Evaluation for On-Orbit Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16011v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual inspection of space-borne assets is of increasing interest to spacecraft operators looking to plan maintenance, characterise damage, and extend the life of high-value satellites in orbit. The environment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) presents unique challenges when planning inspection operations that maximise visibility, information, and data quality. Specular reflection of sunlight from spacecraft bodies, self-shadowing, and dynamic lighting in LEO significantly impact the quality of data captured throughout an orbit. This is exacerbated by the relative motion between spacecraft, which introduces variable imaging distances and attitudes during inspection. Planning inspection trajectories with the aide of simulation is a common approach. However, the ability to design and optimise an inspection trajectory specifically to improve the resulting image quality in proximity operations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present $\partial$LITE, an end-to-end differentiable simulation pipeline for on-orbit inspection operations. We leverage state-of-the-art differentiable rendering tools and a custom orbit propagator to enable end-to-end optimisation of orbital parameters based on visual sensor data. $\partial$LITE enables us to automatically design non-obvious trajectories, vastly improving the quality and usefulness of attained data. To our knowledge, our differentiable inspection-planning pipeline is the first of its kind and provides new insights into modern computational approaches to spacecraft mission planning.

However, existing learning-based methods exhibit three key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of trajectory semantics and hierarchy, lacking both movement dynamics extraction and multi-scale structural representation; (2) high computational costs due to point-wise encoding; and (3) use of physically implausible augmentations that distort trajectory semantics. To address these issues, we propose MovSemCL, a movement-semantics contrastive learning framework for trajectory similarity computation. MovSemCL first transforms raw GPS trajectories into movement-semantics features and then segments them into patches. Next, MovSemCL employs intra- and inter-patch attentions to encode local as well as global trajectory patterns, enabling efficient hierarchical representation and reducing computational costs. Moreover, MovSemCL includes a curvature-guided augmentation strategy that preserves informative segments (e.g., turns and intersections) and masks redundant ones, generating physically plausible augmented views. Experiments on real-world datasets show that MovSemCL is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods, achieving mean ranks close to the ideal value of 1 at similarity search tasks and improvements by up to 20.3% at heuristic approximation, while reducing inference latency by up to 43.4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures; accepted by AAAI 2026 as an Oral paper</p></details> |
| **[Expand and Prune: Maximizing Trajectory Diversity for Effective GRPO in Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15347v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a powerful technique for aligning generative models, but its effectiveness is bottlenecked by the conflict between large group sizes and prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs. Extensive experiments on both diffusion-based and flow-based models demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our Pro-GRPO framework.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

In contrast to methods that rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate discrete occupancy tokens, which inherently limit representational capacity, our approach predicts multi-frame future occupancy in an end-to-end manner directly from raw image features. Inspired by the success of attention-based transformer architectures in foundational vision and language models such as GPT and VGGT, we employ a sparse occupancy representation that bypasses the intermediate bird's eye view (BEV) projection and its explicit geometric priors. This design allows the transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependencies more effectively. By avoiding both the finite-capacity constraint of discrete tokenization and the structural limitations of BEV representations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting, outperforming existing approaches by a significant margin. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust scene dynamics understanding, consistently delivering high accuracy under arbitrary future trajectory conditioning.</p></details> |  |

However, their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations poses significant risks, especially in Federated Learning (FL) settings where identical models are distributed across thousands of clients. While adversarial training is a strong defense, it is difficult to apply in FL due to strict client-data privacy constraints and the limited compute available on edge devices. In this work, we introduce TrajSyn, a privacy-preserving framework that enables effective server-side adversarial training by synthesizing a proxy dataset from the trajectories of client model updates, without accessing raw client data. We show that TrajSyn consistently improves adversarial robustness on image classification benchmarks with no extra compute burden on the client device.</p></details> |  |

Towards that end, the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has emerged as an essential architecture for enabling ubiquitous UAV connectivity. To address the pronounced disparities in coverage and signal characteristics across heterogeneous networks, this paper formulates UAV mobility management in SAGIN as a constrained multi-objective joint optimization problem. The formulation couples discrete link selection with continuous trajectory optimization. Building on this, we propose a two-level multi-agent hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework that decomposes the problem into two alternately solvable subproblems. To map complex link selection decisions into a compact discrete action space, we conceive a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm in the top-level, which achieves stable and high-quality policy learning through double Q-value estimation. To handle the continuous trajectory action space while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints, we integrate the maximum-entropy mechanism of the soft actor-critic (SAC) and employ a Lagrangian-based constrained SAC (CSAC) algorithm in the lower-level that dynamically adjusts the Lagrange multipliers to balance constraint satisfaction and policy optimization. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be extended to multi-UAV scenarios under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, which enables more generalizable policies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms existing benchmarks in throughput, link switching frequency and QoS satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions. The results establish a proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based inference of social interactions suitable for constructing interaction-aware social networks, with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, datasets containing suboptimal and fragmented trajectories present challenges for reward propagation, resulting in inaccurate value estimation and degraded policy performance. While trajectory stitching via generative models offers a promising solution, existing augmentation methods frequently produce trajectories that are either confined to the support of the behavior policy or violate the underlying dynamics, thereby limiting their effectiveness for policy improvement. We propose ASTRO, a data augmentation framework that generates distributionally novel and dynamics-consistent trajectories for offline RL. ASTRO first learns a temporal-distance representation to identify distinct and reachable stitch targets. We then employ a dynamics-guided stitch planner that adaptively generates connecting action sequences via Rollout Deviation Feedback, defined as the gap between target state sequence and the actual arrived state sequence by executing predicted actions, to improve trajectory stitching's feasibility and reachability. This approach facilitates effective augmentation through stitching and ultimately enhances policy learning. ASTRO outperforms prior offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms, achieving notable performance gain on the challenging OGBench suite and demonstrating consistent improvements on standard offline RL benchmarks such as D4RL.</p></details> |  |

| **[DRAW2ACT: Turning Depth-Encoded Trajectories into Robotic Demonstration Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14217v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models provide powerful real-world simulators for embodied AI but remain limited in controllability for robotic manipulation. Recent works on trajectory-conditioned video generation address this gap but often rely on 2D trajectories or single modality conditioning, which restricts their ability to produce controllable and consistent robotic demonstrations. We present DRAW2ACT, a depth-aware trajectory-conditioned video generation framework that extracts multiple orthogonal representations from the input trajectory, capturing depth, semantics, shape and motion, and injects them into the diffusion model. Moreover, we propose to jointly generate spatially aligned RGB and depth videos, leveraging cross-modality attention mechanisms and depth supervision to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency. Finally, we introduce a multimodal policy model conditioned on the generated RGB and depth sequences to regress the robot's joint angles. Experiments on Bridge V2, Berkeley Autolab, and simulation benchmarks show that DRAW2ACT achieves superior visual fidelity and consistency while yielding higher manipulation success rates compared to existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Tracking for Multi-Manipulator Systems in Constrained Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14206v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of cooperative manipulation by a mobile multi-manipulator system operating in obstacle-cluttered and highly constrained environments under spatio-temporal task specifications. The task requires transporting a grasped object while respecting both continuous robot dynamics and discrete geometric constraints arising from obstacles and narrow passages. To address this hybrid structure, we propose a multi-rate planning and control framework that combines offline generation of an STL-satisfying object trajectory and collision-free base footprints with online constrained inverse kinematics and continuous-time feedback control. The resulting closed-loop system enables coordinated reconfiguration of multiple manipulators while tracking the desired object motion. The approach is evaluated in high-fidelity physics simulations using three Franka Emika Panda mobile manipulators rigidly grasping an object.</p></details> |  |
| **[DTRec: Learning Dynamic Reasoning Trajectories for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14036v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by advances in LLMs, reasoning-enhanced sequential recommendation performs multi-step deliberation before making final predictions, unlocking greater potential for capturing user preferences. However, current methods are constrained by static reasoning trajectories that are ill-suited for the diverse complexity of user behaviors. They suffer from two key limitations: (1) a static reasoning direction, which uses flat supervision signals misaligned with human-like hierarchical reasoning, and (2) a fixed reasoning depth, which inefficiently applies the same computational effort to all users, regardless of pattern complexity. These rigidity lead to suboptimal performance and significant computational waste. To overcome these challenges, we propose DTRec, a novel and effective framework that explores the Dynamic reasoning Trajectory for Sequential Recommendation along both direction and depth. To guide the direction, we develop Hierarchical Process Supervision (HPS), which provides coarse-to-fine supervisory signals to emulate the natural, progressive refinement of human cognitive processes. To optimize the depth, we introduce the Adaptive Reasoning Halting (ARH) mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of reasoning steps by jointly monitoring three indicators. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving up to a 24.5% performance improvement over strong baselines while simultaneously reducing computational cost by up to 41.6%.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Stable Trajectory Clustering: An Efficient Split and Merge Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21808v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering algorithms fundamentally group data points by characteristics to identify patterns. Over the past two decades, researchers have extended these methods to analyze trajectories of humans, animals, and vehicles, studying their behavior and movement across applications. \noindent This paper presents whole-trajectory clustering and sub-trajectory clustering algorithms based on DBSCAN line segment clustering, which encompasses two key events: split and merge of line segments. The events are utilized to capture object movement history based on the average Euclidean distance between line segments. In this framework, whole-trajectory clustering considers entire entities' trajectories, whereas sub-trajectory clustering employs a sliding window model to identify local similarity patterns. Many existing trajectory clustering algorithms respond to temporary anomalies in data by splitting trajectories, which often obscures otherwise consistent clustering patterns and leads to less reliable insights. To address this, we introduce the stable trajectory clustering algorithm, which leverages the mean absolute deviation concept to demonstrate that selective omission of transient deviations not only preserves the integrity of clusters but also improves their stability and interpretability. We evaluate all proposed algorithms on real trajectory datasets to illustrate their effectiveness and sensitivity to parameter variations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal parallelisation of continuous-time maximum-a-posteriori trajectory estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13319v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a parallel-in-time method for computing continuous-time maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) trajectory estimates of the states of partially observed stochastic differential equations (SDEs), with the goal of improving computational speed on parallel architectures. The MAP estimation problem is reformulated as a continuous-time optimal control problem based on the Onsager-Machlup functional. This reformulation enables the use of a previously proposed parallel-in-time solution for optimal control problems, which we adapt to the current problem. The structure of the resulting optimal control problem admits a parallel solution based on parallel associative scan algorithms. In the linear Gaussian special case, it yields a parallel Kalman-Bucy filter and a parallel continuous-time Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. These linear computational methods are further extended to nonlinear continuous-time state-space models through Taylor expansions. We also present the corresponding parallel two-filter smoother. The graphics processing unit (GPU) experiments on linear and nonlinear models demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a significant speedup in computations while maintaining the accuracy of sequential algorithms.</p></details> |  |

It includes four main parts: (1) Automatic spring-mass trajectory library generation; (2) Deadbeat control gain library generation through an actively controlled template model that resembles the whole-body dynamics well; (3) Trajectory selection policy development for step adaptation; (4) Mapping spring-mass trajectories to a humanoid model through a whole-body control (WBC) framework also accounting for closed-kinematic chain systems, self collisions, and reactive limb swinging. We show the inclusiveness and the robustness of the proposed framework through various challenging and agile behaviors such as running through randomly generated stepping stones, jumping over random obstacles, performing slalom motions, changing the running direction suddenly with a random leg, and rejecting significant disturbances and uncertainties through the MuJoCo physics simulator. We also perform additional simulations under a comprehensive set of uncertainties and noise to better justify the proposed method's robustness to real-world challenges, including signal noise, imprecision, modeling errors, and delays. All the aforementioned behaviors are performed with a single library and the same set of WBC control parameters without additional tuning. The spring-mass and the deadbeat control gain library are automatically computed in 4.5 seconds in total for 315 different trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Biomimetic Intelligence and Robotics.

We address vessel destination estimation using global-scope AIS data by proposing a differentiated approach that recasts long port-to-port trajectories as a nested sequence structure. Using spatial grids, this method mitigates spatio-temporal bias while preserving detailed resolution. We introduce a novel deep learning architecture, WAY, designed to process these reformulated trajectories for long-term destination estimation days to weeks in advance. WAY comprises a trajectory representation layer and Channel-Aggregative Sequential Processing (CASP) blocks. The representation layer generates multi-channel vector sequences from kinematic and non-kinematic features. CASP blocks utilize multi-headed channel- and self-attention for aggregation and sequential information delivery. Additionally, we propose a task-specialized Gradient Dropout (GD) technique to enable many-to-many training on single labels, preventing biased feedback surges by stochastically blocking gradient flow based on sample length. Experiments on 5-year AIS data demonstrate WAY's superiority over conventional spatial grid-based approaches regardless of trajectory progression. Results further confirm that adopting GD leads to performance gains. Finally, we explore WAY's potential for real-world application through multitask learning for ETA estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems (TAES)</p></details> |

In realistic FedAvg scenarios with multi-step updates, existing surrogate methods like SME rely on linear interpolation to approximate client trajectories for privacy leakage. However, we demonstrate that linear assumptions fundamentally underestimate SGD's nonlinear complexity, encountering irreducible approximation barriers in non-convex landscapes with only one-dimensional expressiveness. We propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first framework introducing learnable quadratic Bézier curves for trajectory modeling in GIAs against FL. NL-SME leverages $|w|+1$-dimensional control point parameterization combined with dvec scaling and regularization mechanisms to achieve superior approximation accuracy. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST demonstrate NL-SME significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving 94\%--98\% performance gaps and order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining computational efficiency. This work exposes critical privacy vulnerabilities in FL's multi-step paradigm and provides insights for robust defense development.</p></details> |  |

Vanilla PINNs often under-enforce this constraint and produce unstable controls. We propose a Multi-Trajectory PINN (MT-PINN) that adds a rollout-based trajectory loss and propagates a terminal penalty on terminal inventory via backpropagation-through-time, directly enforcing zero terminal inventory. A lightweight lambda-curriculum is adopted to stabilize training as the state expands from a risk-neutral reduced HJB to a risk-averse HJB. On the Gatheral-Schied single-asset model, MT-PINN aligns closely with their derived closed-form solutions and concentrates terminal inventory tightly around zero while reducing errors along optimal paths. We apply MT-PINNs on SPY intraday data, matching TWAP when risk-neutral, and achieving lower exposure and competitive costs, especially in falling windows, for higher risk-aversion.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 19 figures.

Accurate prediction enables realistic simulation and strategic understanding of gameplay evolution. Most existing models are evaluated solely on per-agent accuracy metrics (minADE, minFDE), which assess each agent independently on its best-of-k prediction. However these metrics overlook whether the model learns which predicted trajectories can jointly form a plausible multi-agent future. Many state-of-the-art models are designed and optimized primarily based on these metrics. As a result, they may underperform on joint predictions and also fail to generate coherent, interpretable multi-agent scenarios in team sports. We propose CausalTraj, a temporally causal, likelihood-based model that is built to generate jointly probable multi-agent trajectory forecasts. To better assess collective modeling capability, we emphasize joint metrics (minJADE, minJFDE) that measure joint accuracy across agents within the best generated scenario sample. Evaluated on the NBA SportVU, Basketball-U, and Football-U datasets, CausalTraj achieves competitive per-agent accuracy and the best recorded results on joint metrics, while yielding qualitatively coherent and realistic gameplay evolutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, accepted to the AI4TS Workshop at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

It contains over 440,000 facial trajectories in total, among which more than 52,000 are longer than 10 frames, including 68 manually reviewed trajectories that span the entire 150 frames. To the best of our knowledge, PoreTrack3D is the first benchmark dataset to capture both traditional facial landmarks and pore-scale keypoints trajectory, advancing the study of fine-grained facial expressions through the analysis of subtle skin-surface motion. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting methods on PoreTrack3D, establishing the first performance baseline in this domain. Overall, the pipeline developed for this benchmark dataset's creation establishes a new framework for high-fidelity facial motion capture and dynamic 3D reconstruction.

| **[Measuring What Matters: Scenario-Driven Evaluation for Trajectory Predictors in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12211v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Being able to anticipate the motion of surrounding agents is essential for the safe operation of autonomous driving systems in dynamic situations. While various methods have been proposed for trajectory prediction, the current evaluation practices still rely on error-based metrics (e.g., ADE, FDE), which reveal the accuracy from a post-hoc view but ignore the actual effect the predictor brings to the self-driving vehicles (SDVs), especially in complex interactive scenarios: a high-quality predictor not only chases accuracy, but should also captures all possible directions a neighbor agent might move, to support the SDVs' cautious decision-making. Given that the existing metrics hardly account for this standard, in our work, we propose a comprehensive pipeline that adaptively evaluates the predictor's performance by two dimensions: accuracy and diversity. Based on the criticality of the driving scenario, these two dimensions are dynamically combined and result in a final score for the predictor's performance. Extensive experiments on a closed-loop benchmark using real-world datasets show that our pipeline yields a more reasonable evaluation than traditional metrics by better reflecting the correlation of the predictors' evaluation with the autonomous vehicles' driving performance. This evaluation pipeline shows a robust way to select a predictor that potentially contributes most to the SDV's driving performance.</p></details> | 9 Pages, 8 Figures |

Modern trajectory planning techniques primarily use numerical optimization, as they enable the systematic computation of high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints. However, stringent requirements on computation time and the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework called STITCHER that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long-range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. STITCHER outperforms modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is performed to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, along with a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners. Simulation tests show that safe trajectories can be created within a few milliseconds for paths that span the entirety of two 50 m x 50 m environments. Hardware tests with a custom quadrotor verify that STITCHER can produce trackable paths in real-time while respecting nonconvex constraints, such as limits on tilt angle and motor forces, which are otherwise hard to include in optimization-based planners.</p></details> |  |

We present Touchscreen Electromagnetic Side-channel Leakage Attack (TESLA), a non-contact attack framework that captures EM signals generated during on-screen writing and regresses them into two-dimensional (2D) handwriting trajectories in real time. Extensive evaluations across a variety of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) smartphones show that TESLA achieves 77% character recognition accuracy and a Jaccard index of 0.74, demonstrating its capability to recover highly recognizable motion trajectories that closely resemble the original handwriting under realistic attack conditions.</p></details> |  |

We propose the Plasticity-Ceiling Framework to theoretically ground this landscape, decomposing performance into foundational SFT performance and the subsequent RL plasticity. Through extensive benchmarking, we establish the Sequential SFT-then-RL pipeline as the superior standard, overcoming the stability deficits of synchronized approaches. Furthermore, we derive precise scaling guidelines: (1) Transitioning to RL at the SFT Stable or Mild Overfitting Sub-phase maximizes the final ceiling by securing foundational SFT performance without compromising RL plasticity; (2) Refuting ``Less is More'' in the context of SFT-then-RL scaling, we demonstrate that Data Scale determines the primary post-training potential, while Trajectory Difficulty acts as a performance multiplier; and (3) Identifying that the Minimum SFT Validation Loss serves as a robust indicator for selecting the expert trajectories that maximize the final performance ceiling. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for maximizing the value extracted from expert trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, under review</p></details> |

This study evaluates an AI-guided student support system at a large university using doubly robust propensity score matching. We advance the methodology for learning analytics evaluation by leveraging time-aligned, dynamic AI probability of success scores to match 1,859 treated students to controls, thereby mitigating the selection and immortal time biases often overlooked in observational studies. Results indicate that the intervention effectively stabilised precarious trajectories, and compared to the control group, supported students significantly reduced their course failure rates and achieved higher cumulative grades. However, effects on the speed of qualification completion were positive but statistically constrained. We interpreted these findings through Activity Theory, framing the intervention as a socio-technical brake that interrupts and slows the accumulation of academic failure among at-risk students. The student support-AI configuration successfully resolved the primary contradiction of immediate academic risk, but secondary contradictions within institutional structures limited the acceleration of degree completion. We conclude that while AI-enabled support effectively arrests decline, translating this stability into faster progression requires aligning intervention strategies with broader institutional governance.</p></details> |  |

Current protection methods are limited to passively degrading image quality, failing to achieve stable control. While Targeted Data Protection (TDP) offers a promising paradigm for active redirection toward user-specified target concepts, existing TDP attempts suffer from poor controllability due to snapshot-matching approaches that fail to account for complete learning dynamics. We introduce TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations), the first method to successfully achieve effective TDP by controlling the entire training trajectory. Unlike snapshot-based methods whose protective influence is easily diluted as training progresses, TAFAP employs trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent, verifiable transformations throughout fine-tuning. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over both identity and visual patterns. TAFAP significantly outperforms existing TDP attempts, achieving robust redirection toward target concepts while maintaining high image quality. This work enables verifiable safeguards and provides a new framework for controlling and tracing alterations in diffusion model outputs.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion. Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.</p></details> |  |

While recent progress in nonconvex guidance and control is paving the way for onboard autonomous trajectory optimization, these methods still rely on extensive expert input (e.g., waypoints, constraints, mission timelines, etc.), which limits the operational scalability in real rendezvous missions. This paper introduces SAGES (Semantic Autonomous Guidance Engine for Space), a trajectory-generation framework that translates natural-language commands into spacecraft trajectories that reflect high-level intent while respecting nonconvex constraints. Experiments in two settings -- fault-tolerant proximity operations with continuous-time constraint enforcement and a free-flying robotic platform -- demonstrate that SAGES reliably produces trajectories aligned with human commands, achieving over 90% semantic-behavioral consistency across diverse behavior modes. Ultimately, this work marks an initial step toward language-conditioned, constraint-aware spacecraft trajectory generation, enabling operators to interactively guide both safety and behavior through intuitive natural-language commands with reduced expert burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 12 figures.

| **[FAST: Foreground-aware Diffusion with Accelerated Sampling Trajectory for Segmentation-oriented Anomaly Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20295v4)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations, yet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label. Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step, preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream segmentation tasks. We release the code at: https://github.com/Chhro123/fast-foreground-aware-anomaly-synthesis.</p></details> |  |

Standard world models typically rely on action-conditioned trajectories, which limits effectiveness when action labels are scarce. We introduce a family of latent-action world models that jointly use action-conditioned and action-free data by learning a shared latent action representation. This latent space aligns observed control signals with actions inferred from passive observations, enabling a single dynamics model to train on large-scale unlabeled trajectories while requiring only a small set of action-labeled ones. We use the latent-action world model to learn a latent-action policy through offline reinforcement learning (RL), thereby bridging two traditionally separate domains: offline RL, which typically relies on action-conditioned data, and action-free training, which is rarely used with subsequent RL. On the DeepMind Control Suite, our approach achieves strong performance while using about an order of magnitude fewer action-labeled samples than purely action-conditioned baselines. These results show that latent actions enable training on both passive and interactive data, which makes world models learn more efficiently.</p></details> |  |

Incorporating controllability in video generation further adds to the complexity. Existing controllable video generation approaches face a trade-off: sparse controls like keypoint trajectories are easy to specify but lack instance-awareness, while dense signals such as optical flow, depths or 3D meshes are informative but costly to obtain. We propose VHOI, a two-stage framework that first densifies sparse trajectories into HOI mask sequences, and then fine-tunes a video diffusion model conditioned on these dense masks. We introduce a novel HOI-aware motion representation that uses color encodings to distinguish not only human and object motion, but also body-part-specific dynamics. This design incorporates a human prior into the conditioning signal and strengthens the model's ability to understand and generate realistic HOI dynamics. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in controllable HOI video generation. VHOI is not limited to interaction-only scenarios and can also generate full human navigation leading up to object interactions in an end-to-end manner.

Current visual navigation methods are typically limited to simulated or off-street environments, and often rely on precise goal formats, such as specific coordinates or images. This limits their effectiveness for autonomous agents like last-mile delivery robots navigating unfamiliar cities. To address these limitations, we introduce UrbanNav, a scalable framework that trains embodied agents to follow free-form language instructions in diverse urban settings. Leveraging web-scale city walking videos, we develop an scalable annotation pipeline that aligns human navigation trajectories with language instructions grounded in real-world landmarks. UrbanNav encompasses over 1,500 hours of navigation data and 3 million instruction-trajectory-landmark triplets, capturing a wide range of urban scenarios. Our model learns robust navigation policies to tackle complex urban scenarios, demonstrating superior spatial reasoning, robustness to noisy instructions, and generalization to unseen urban settings. Experimental results show that UrbanNav significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the potential of large-scale web video data to enable language-guided, real-world urban navigation for embodied agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, guiding these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans, appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions.

Traditional roadside video collection often fails in dense mixed traffic due to occlusion, limited viewing angles, and irregular vehicle movements. UAV-based recording provides a top-down perspective that reduces these issues and captures rich spatial and temporal dynamics. The datasets described here were extracted using the Data from Sky (DFS) platform and validated against manual counts, space mean speeds, and probe trajectories in earlier work. Each dataset contains time-stamped vehicle positions, speeds, longitudinal and lateral accelerations, and vehicle classifications at a resolution of 30 frames per second. Data were collected at six mid-block locations in the national capital region of India, covering diverse traffic compositions and density levels. Exploratory analyses highlight key behavioural patterns, including lane-keeping preferences, speed distributions, and lateral manoeuvres typical of heterogeneous and area-based traffic settings. These datasets are intended as a resource for the global research community to support simulation modelling, safety assessment, and behavioural studies under area-based traffic conditions. By making these empirical datasets openly available, this work offers researchers a unique opportunity to develop, test, and validate models that more accurately represent complex urban traffic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper presents basic statistics and trends in empirically observed data from highly heterogeneous and area-based traffic while offering the datasets open source for researchers and practitioners</p></details> |

Existing methods, however, often struggle to capture the full richness of these dynamics, particularly the co-existence of multi-scale interactions and the diverse behaviors of heterogeneous agents. To address these challenges, this paper introduces HeLoFusion, an efficient and scalable encoder for modeling heterogeneous and multi-scale agent interactions. Instead of relying on global context, HeLoFusion constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each agent, allowing it to effectively model both direct pairwise dependencies and complex group-wise interactions (\textit{e.g.}, platooning vehicles or pedestrian crowds). Furthermore, HeLoFusion tackles the critical challenge of agent heterogeneity through an aggregation-decomposition message-passing scheme and type-specific feature networks, enabling it to learn nuanced, type-dependent interaction patterns. This locality-focused approach enables a principled representation of multi-level social context, yielding powerful and expressive agent embeddings. On the challenging Waymo Open Motion Dataset, HeLoFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting new benchmarks for key metrics including Soft mAP and minADE. Our work demonstrates that a locality-grounded architecture, which explicitly models multi-scale and heterogeneous interactions, is a highly effective strategy for advancing motion forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[A data-driven approach to inferring travel trajectory during peak hours in urban rail transit systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14728v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refined trajectory inference of urban rail transit is of great significance to the operation organization. In this paper, we develop a fully data-driven approach to inferring individual travel trajectories in urban rail transit systems. It utilizes data from the Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) systems to infer key trajectory elements, such as selected train, access/egress time, and transfer time. The approach includes establishing train alternative sets based on spatio-temporal constraints, data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, and trave l trajectory construction. To realize data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, a data-driven parameter estimation method based on KL divergence combined with EM algorithm (KLEM) was proposed. This method eliminates the reliance on external or survey data for parameter fitting, enhancing the robustness and applicability of the model. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of using synthetic data to validate the result, this paper employs real individual travel trajectory data for verification. The results show that the approach developed in this paper can achieve high-precision passenger trajectory inference, with an accuracy rate of over 90% in urban rail transit travel trajectory inference during peak hours.</p></details> |  |

Existing motion-controllable methods typically suffer from coarse control granularity and limited scalability, leaving their outputs insufficient for practical use. We narrow this gap by achieving precise and high-quality motion control. Our core idea is to directly make the original condition features motion-aware for guiding video synthesis. To this end, we first represent object motions with dense point trajectories, allowing fine-grained control over the scene. We then project these trajectories into latent space and propagate the first frame's features along each trajectory, producing an aligned spatiotemporal feature map that tells how each scene element should move. This feature map serves as the updated latent condition, which is naturally integrated into the off-the-shelf image-to-video model, e.g., Wan-I2V-14B, as motion guidance without any architecture change. It removes the need for auxiliary motion encoders and makes fine-tuning base models easily scalable. Through scaled training, Wan-Move generates 5-second, 480p videos whose motion controllability rivals Kling 1.5 Pro's commercial Motion Brush, as indicated by user studies. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further design MoveBench, a rigorously curated benchmark featuring diverse content categories and hybrid-verified annotations. It is distinguished by larger data volume, longer video durations, and high-quality motion annotations. Extensive experiments on MoveBench and the public dataset consistently show Wan-Move's superior motion quality. Code, models, and benchmark data are made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neurl...</summary><p>NeurlPS 2025.

| **[Gradient-Informed Monte Carlo Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models for Low-Thrust Trajectory Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08705v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preliminary mission design of low-thrust spacecraft trajectories in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem is a global search characterized by a complex objective landscape and numerous local minima. Formulating the problem as sampling from an unnormalized distribution supported on neighborhoods of locally optimal solutions, provides the opportunity to deploy Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and generative machine learning. In this work, we extend our previous self-supervised diffusion model fine-tuning framework to employ gradient-informed Markov chain Monte Carlo. We compare two algorithms - the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo - both initialized from a distribution learned by a diffusion model. Derivatives of an objective function that balances fuel consumption, time of flight and constraint violations are computed analytically using state transition matrices. We show that incorporating the gradient drift term accelerates mixing and improves convergence of the Markov chain for a multi-revolution transfer in the Saturn-Titan system. Among the evaluated methods, MALA provides the best trade-off between performance and computational cost. Starting from samples generated by a baseline diffusion model trained on a related transfer, MALA explicitly targets Pareto-optimal solutions. Compared to a random walk Metropolis algorithm, it increases the feasibility rate from 17.34% to 63.01% and produces a denser, more diverse coverage of the Pareto front. By fine-tuning a diffusion model on the generated samples and associated reward values with reward-weighted likelihood maximization, we learn the global solution structure of the problem and eliminate the need for a tedious separate data generation phase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ergodic Trajectory Planning with Dynamic Sensor Footprints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08661v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of trajectory planning for information gathering with a dynamic and resolution-varying sensor footprint. Ergodic planning offers a principled framework that balances exploration (visiting all areas) and exploitation (focusing on high-information regions) by planning trajectories such that the time spent in a region is proportional to the amount of information in that region. Existing ergodic planning often oversimplifies the sensing model by assuming a point sensor or a footprint with constant shape and resolution. In practice, the sensor footprint can drastically change over time as the robot moves, such as aerial robots equipped with downward-facing cameras, whose field of view depends on the orientation and altitude. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new metric that accounts for dynamic sensor footprints, analyze the theoretic local optimality conditions, and propose numerical trajectory optimization algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can simultaneously optimize both the trajectories and sensor footprints, with up to an order of magnitude better ergodicity than conventional methods. We also deploy our approach in a multi-drone system to ergodically cover an object in 3D space.</p></details> | 12 figures |

We treat each task as a trajectory generation scenario defined by a specific number of drone-to-drone interactions. To model relationships across scenarios, we employ Multi-Task Gaussian Processes, which capture shared structure across tasks and enable efficient information transfer during optimization. We compare two strategies: optimizing the average mission time across all tasks and optimizing each task individually. Through a comprehensive simulation campaign, we show that single-task optimization leads to progressively shorter mission times as swarm size grows, but requires significantly more optimization time than the average-task approach.</p></details> |  |

Existing anomaly detection methods are ill-suited for this challenge: mean-pooling embeddings dilutes anomalous steps, while contrastive-only approaches ignore sequential structure. Standard unsupervised methods on pre-trained embeddings achieve F1-scores no higher than 0.69. We introduce Trajectory Guard, a Siamese Recurrent Autoencoder with a hybrid loss function that jointly learns task-trajectory alignment via contrastive learning and sequential validity via reconstruction. This dual objective enables unified detection of both "wrong plan for this task" and "malformed plan structure." On benchmarks spanning synthetic perturbations and real-world failures from security audits (RAS-Eval) and multi-agent systems (Who\&When), we achieve F1-scores of 0.88-0.94 on balanced sets and recall of 0.86-0.92 on imbalanced external benchmarks. At 32 ms inference latency, our approach runs 17-27$\times$ faster than LLM Judge baselines, enabling real-time safety verification in production deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI Trustagent 2026</p></details> |
| **[Imitation from Observations with Trajectory-Level Generative Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00452v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the offline imitation learning from observations (LfO) where the expert demonstrations are scarce and the available offline suboptimal data are far from the expert behavior. Many existing distribution-matching approaches struggle in this regime because they impose strict support constraints and rely on brittle one-step models, making it hard to extract useful signal from imperfect data. To tackle this challenge, we propose TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding for offline LfO that constructs a dense, smooth surrogate reward by estimating expert state density in the latent space of a temporal diffusion model trained on offline trajectory data. By leveraging the smooth geometry of the learned diffusion embedding, TGE captures long-horizon temporal dynamics and effectively bridges the gap between disjoint supports, ensuring a robust learning signal even when offline data is distributionally distinct from the expert. Empirically, the proposed approach consistently matches or outperforms prior offline LfO methods across a range of D4RL locomotion and manipulation benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this study, we propose a model-free clustering framework that groups baskets based on transition probabilities derived from the trajectories of treatment response, rather than relying solely on a single efficacy endpoint such as the objective response rate. The number of clusters is not predetermined but is automatically determined in a data-driven manner based on the similarity structure among baskets. After clustering, baskets within the same cluster are analyzed using a hierarchical Bayesian model. This framework aims to improve the estimation precision of efficacy endpoints and enhance statistical power while maintaining the type~I error rate at the nominal level. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated through simulation studies. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can accurately identify cluster structures in heterogeneous settings and, even under such conditions, maintain the type~I error rate at the nominal level while improving statistical power.</p></details> |  |

Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures.

In this paper, we enhance high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline. Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.</p></details> |  |

To address these, we first present the EgoMAN dataset, a large-scale egocentric dataset for interaction stage-aware 3D hand trajectory prediction with 219K 6DoF trajectories and 3M structured QA pairs for semantic, spatial, and motion reasoning. We then introduce the EgoMAN model, a reasoning-to-motion framework that links vision-language reasoning and motion generation via a trajectory-token interface. Trained progressively to align reasoning with motion dynamics, our approach yields accurate and stage-aware trajectories with generalization across real-world scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://egoman-project.github.io</p></details> |
| **[OSVI-WM: One-Shot Visual Imitation for Unseen Tasks using World-Model-Guided Trajectory Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20425v2)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual imitation learning enables robotic agents to acquire skills by observing expert demonstration videos. In the one-shot setting, the agent generates a policy after observing a single expert demonstration without additional fine-tuning. Existing approaches typically train and evaluate on the same set of tasks, varying only object configurations, and struggle to generalize to unseen tasks with different semantic or structural requirements. While some recent methods attempt to address this, they exhibit low success rates on hard test tasks that, despite being visually similar to some training tasks, differ in context and require distinct responses. Additionally, most existing methods lack an explicit model of environment dynamics, limiting their ability to reason about future states. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for one-shot visual imitation learning via world-model-guided trajectory generation. Given an expert demonstration video and the agent's initial observation, our method leverages a learned world model to predict a sequence of latent states and actions. This latent trajectory is then decoded into physical waypoints that guide the agent's execution. Our method is evaluated on two simulated benchmarks and three real-world robotic platforms, where it consistently outperforms prior approaches, with over 30% improvement in some cases.

However, conventional control algorithms for trajectory tracking often exhibit limited performance due to the underactuated, nonlinear, and highly coupled dynamics of quadrotor systems. To address these challenges, we propose HBO-PID, a novel control algorithm that integrates the Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimization (HBO) framework with the classical PID controller to achieve accurate and robust trajectory tracking. By explicitly modeling input-dependent noise variance, the proposed method can better adapt to dynamic and complex environments, and therefore improve the accuracy and robustness of trajectory tracking. To accelerate the convergence of optimization, we adopt a two-stage optimization strategy that allow us to more efficiently find the optimal controller parameters. Through experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Compared to SOTA methods, it improves the position accuracy by 24.7% to 42.9%, and the angular accuracy by 40.9% to 78.4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025 (2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems)</p></details> |
| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v3)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRelay: A Universal Spatio-Temporal Relaying Framework for Location Prediction over Human Trajectory Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16620v2)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next location prediction is a critical task in human mobility modeling, enabling applications like travel planning and urban mobility management. Existing methods mainly rely on historical spatiotemporal trajectory data to train sequence models that directly forecast future locations. However, they often overlook the importance of the future spatiotemporal contexts, which are highly informative for the future locations. For example, knowing how much time and distance a user will travel could serve as a critical clue for predicting the user's next location. Against this background, we propose \textbf{STRelay}, a universal \textbf{\underline{S}}patio\textbf{\underline{T}}emporal \textbf{\underline{Relay}}ing framework explicitly modeling the future spatiotemporal context given a human trajectory, to boost the performance of different location prediction models. Specifically, STRelay models future spatiotemporal contexts in a relaying manner, which is subsequently integrated with the encoded historical representation from a base location prediction model, enabling multi-task learning by simultaneously predicting the next time interval, next moving distance interval, and finally the next location. We evaluate STRelay integrated with five state-of-the-art location prediction base models on four real-world trajectory datasets. Results demonstrate that STRelay consistently improves prediction performance across all cases by 2.49\%-11.30\%. Additionally, we find that the future spatiotemporal contexts are particularly helpful for entertainment-related locations and also for user groups who prefer traveling longer distances. The performance gain on such non-daily-routine activities, which often suffer from higher uncertainty, is indeed complementary to the base location prediction models that often excel at modeling regular daily routine patterns.</p></details> |  |

However, current iterative solving approaches which alternate between diffusion sampling and data consistency steps typically require hundreds or thousands of steps to achieve high quality reconstruction due to accumulated errors. We address this challenge with SURE Guided Posterior Sampling (SGPS), a method that corrects sampling trajectory deviations using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) gradient updates and PCA based noise estimation. By mitigating noise induced errors during the critical early and middle sampling stages, SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling and reduces error accumulation. This allows our method to maintain high reconstruction quality with fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs). Our extensive evaluation across diverse inverse problems demonstrates that SGPS consistently outperforms existing methods at low NFE counts.</p></details> |  |

While repair-based methods fail to restore complex artifacts and LiDAR-based approaches rely on sparse and incomplete cues, ReCamDriving leverages dense and scene-complete 3DGS renderings for explicit geometric guidance, achieving precise camera-controllable generation. To mitigate overfitting to restoration behaviors when conditioned on 3DGS renderings, ReCamDriving adopts a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage uses camera poses for coarse control, while the second stage incorporates 3DGS renderings for fine-grained viewpoint and geometric guidance. Furthermore, we present a 3DGS-based cross-trajectory data curation strategy to eliminate the train-test gap in camera transformation patterns, enabling scalable multi-trajectory supervision from monocular videos. Based on this strategy, we construct the ParaDrive dataset, containing over 110K parallel-trajectory video pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCamDriving achieves state-of-the-art camera controllability and structural consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://recamdriving.github.io/</p></details> |

While consistency models offer a potential solution, existing applications to decision-making either struggle with suboptimal demonstrations under behavior cloning or rely on complex concurrent training of multiple networks under the actor-critic framework. In this work, we propose a novel approach to consistency distillation for offline reinforcement learning that directly incorporates reward optimization into the distillation process. Our method achieves single-step sampling while generating higher-reward action trajectories through decoupled training and noise-free reward signals. Empirical evaluations on the Gym MuJoCo, FrankaKitchen, and long horizon planning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach can achieve a 9.7% improvement over previous state-of-the-art while offering up to 142x speedup over diffusion counterparts in inference time.</p></details> |  |

However, efficiently modeling the dynamic interactions between numerous road users and infrastructures in complex scenes remains an open problem. Existing methods typically employ distance-based or fully connected dense graph structures to capture interaction information, which not only introduces a large number of redundant edges but also requires complex and heavily parameterized networks for encoding, thereby resulting in low training and inference efficiency, limiting scalability to large and complex traffic scenes. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose SparScene, a sparse graph learning framework designed for efficient and scalable traffic scene representation. Instead of relying on distance thresholds, SparScene leverages the lane graph topology to construct structure-aware sparse connections between agents and lanes, enabling efficient yet informative scene graph representation. SparScene adopts a lightweight graph encoder that efficiently aggregates agent-map and agent-agent interactions, yielding compact scene representations with substantially improved efficiency and scalability. On the motion prediction benchmark of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), SparScene achieves competitive performance with remarkable efficiency. It generates trajectories for more than 200 agents in a scene within 5 ms and scales to more than 5,000 agents and 17,000 lanes with merely 54 ms of inference time with a GPU memory of 2.9 GB, highlighting its superior scalability for large-scale traffic scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, considering the time-varying task criticality characteristics of diverse WBAN users and the dual mobility between WBAN users and UAV, we investigate the dynamic task offloading and UAV flight trajectory optimization problem to minimize the weighted average task completion time of all the WBAN users, under the constraint of UAV energy consumption. To tackle the problem, an embodied AI-enhanced IoMT edge computing framework is established. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical multi-scale Transformer-based user trajectory prediction model based on the users' historical trajectory traces captured by the embodied AI agent (i.e., UAV). Afterwards, a prediction-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that integrates predicted users' mobility information is designed for intelligently optimizing UAV flight trajectory and task offloading decisions. Real-word movement traces and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in comparison with the existing benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Discrete sensing strategies, including sensor arrays and distributed sensors, are broadly involved in tactile sensors across versatile applications. However, it remains a challenge to achieve high spatial resolution with self-decoupled capacity and insensitivity to other off-axis stimuli for stretchable tactile sensors. Herein, we develop a stretchable tactile sensor based on the proposed continuous spectral-filtering principle, allowing superhigh resolution for applied stimuli. This proposed sensor enables a high-linear spatial response (0.996) even during stretching and bending, and high continuous spatial (7 μm) and force (5 mN) resolutions with design scalability and interaction robustness to survive piercing and cutting. We further demonstrate the sensors' performance by integrating them into a planar parallel mechanism for precise trajectory tracking (rotational resolution: 0.02°) in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

Efficient Data Pruning for Large-scale Autonomous Driving Dataset via Trajectory Entropy Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19270v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting large-scale naturalistic driving data is essential for training robust autonomous driving planners. However, real-world datasets often contain a substantial amount of repetitive and low-value samples, which lead to excessive storage costs and bring limited benefits to policy learning. To address this issue, we propose an information-theoretic data pruning method that effectively reduces the training data volume without compromising model performance. Our approach evaluates the trajectory distribution information entropy of driving data and iteratively selects high-value samples that preserve the statistical characteristics of the original dataset in a model-agnostic manner. From a theoretical perspective, we show that maximizing trajectory entropy effectively constrains the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the pruned subset and the original data distribution, thereby maintaining generalization ability. Comprehensive experiments on the NuPlan benchmark with a large-scale imitation learning framework demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the dataset size by up to 40% while maintaining closed-loop performance. This work provides a lightweight and theoretically grounded approach for scalable data management and efficient policy learning in autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at video understanding tasks, their real-time mobile deployment is constrained by heavy computational costs and inefficient redundant frame processing. To address these issues, we propose the FC-MIR framework: leveraging keyframe sampling and adaptive concatenation, it cuts visual redundancy to boost inference efficiency, while integrating state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs or fine-tuned models (e.g., Qwen3-VL) for trajectory summarization and intent prediction. We further expand task scope to explore generating post-prediction operations and search suggestions, and introduce a fine-grained metric to evaluate the practical utility of summaries, predictions, and suggestions. For rigorous assessment, we construct a UI trajectory dataset covering scenarios from UI-Agents (Agent-I) and real user interactions (Person-I). Experimental results show our compression method retains performance at 50%-60% compression rates; both closed-source and fine-tuned MLLMs demonstrate strong intent summarization, supporting potential lightweight on-device deployment. However, MLLMs still struggle with useful and "surprising" suggestions, leaving room for improvement. Finally, we deploy the framework in a real-world setting, integrating UI perception and UI-Agent proxies to lay a foundation for future progress in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Classification Network Guided Trajectory Planning for Four-Wheel Independent Steering Autonomous Parking Considering Obstacle Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18836v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Four-wheel Independent Steering (4WIS) vehicles have attracted increasing attention for their superior maneuverability. Human drivers typically choose to cross or drive over the low-profile obstacles (e.g., plastic bags) to efficiently navigate through narrow spaces, while existing planners neglect obstacle attributes, causing inefficiency or path-finding failures. To address this, we propose a trajectory planning framework integrating the 4WIS hybrid A* and Optimal Control Problem (OCP), in which the hybrid A* provides an initial path to enhance the OCP solution. Specifically, a multimodal classification network is introduced to assess scene complexity (hard/easy task) by fusing image and vehicle state data. For hard tasks, guided points are set to decompose complex tasks into local subtasks, improving the search efficiency of 4WIS hybrid A*. The multiple steering modes of 4WIS vehicles (Ackermann, diagonal, and zero-turn) are also incorporated into node expansion and heuristic designs. Moreover, a hierarchical obstacle handling strategy is designed to guide the node expansion considering obstacle attributes, i.e., 'non-traversable', 'crossable', and 'drive-over' obstacles. It allows crossing or driving over obstacles instead of the 'avoid-only' strategy, greatly enhancing success rates of pathfinding. We also design a logical constraint for the 'drive-over' obstacle by limiting its velocity to ensure safety. Furthermore, to address dynamic obstacles with motion uncertainty, we introduce a probabilistic risk field model, constructing risk-aware driving corridors that serve as linear collision constraints in OCP. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework's effectiveness in generating safe, efficient, and smooth trajectories for 4WIS vehicles, especially in constrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[CauTraj: A Causal-Knowledge-Guided Framework for Lane-Changing Trajectory Planning of Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18703v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the performance of trajectory planners for lane - changing vehicles is one of the key challenges in autonomous driving within human - machine mixed traffic. Most existing studies have not incorporated human drivers' prior knowledge when designing trajectory planning models. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel trajectory planning framework that integrates causal prior knowledge into the control process. Both longitudinal and lateral microscopic behaviors of vehicles are modeled to quantify interaction risk, and a staged causal graph is constructed to capture causal dependencies in lane-changing scenarios. Causal effects between the lane-changing vehicle and surrounding vehicles are then estimated using causal inference, including average causal effects (ATE) and conditional average treatment effects (CATE). These causal priors are embedded into a model predictive control (MPC) framework to enhance trajectory planning. The proposed approach is validated on naturalistic vehicle trajectory datasets. Experimental results show that: (1) causal inference provides interpretable and stable quantification of vehicle interactions; (2) individual causal effects reveal driver heterogeneity; and (3) compared with the baseline MPC, the proposed method achieves a closer alignment with human driving behaviors, reducing maximum trajectory deviation from 1.2 m to 0.2 m, lateral velocity fluctuation by 60%, and yaw angle variability by 50%. These findings provide methodological support for human-like trajectory planning and practical value for improving safety, stability, and realism in autonomous vehicle testing and traffic simulation platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for UAV-Based Smart Farming Using Imitation-Based Triple Deep Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18604v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising auxiliary platform for smart agriculture, capable of simultaneously performing weed detection, recognition, and data collection from wireless sensors. However, trajectory planning for UAV-based smart agriculture is challenging due to the high uncertainty of the environment, partial observations, and limited battery capacity of UAVs. To address these issues, we formulate the trajectory planning problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to solve it. Furthermore, we propose a novel imitation-based triple deep Q-network (ITDQN) algorithm, which employs an elite imitation mechanism to reduce exploration costs and utilizes a mediator Q-network over a double deep Q-network (DDQN) to accelerate and stabilize training and improve performance. Experimental results in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution. Moreover, our proposed ITDQN outperforms DDQN by 4.43\% in weed recognition rate and 6.94\% in data collection rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Commercial Vehicle Braking Optimization: A Robust SIFT-Trajectory Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18597v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A vision-based trajectory analysis solution is proposed to address the "zero-speed braking" issue caused by inaccurate Controller Area Network (CAN) signals in commercial vehicle Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) systems during low-speed operation. The algorithm utilizes the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier platform to process sequential video frames from a blind spot camera, employing self-adaptive Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)-enhanced Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) feature extraction and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)-Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) matching. This allows for precise classification of the vehicle's motion state (static, vibration, moving). Key innovations include 1) multiframe trajectory displacement statistics (5-frame sliding window), 2) a dual-threshold state decision matrix, and 3) OBD-II driven dynamic Region of Interest (ROI) configuration. The system effectively suppresses environmental interference and false detection of dynamic objects, directly addressing the challenge of low-speed false activation in commercial vehicle safety systems. Evaluation in a real-world dataset (32,454 video segments from 1,852 vehicles) demonstrates an F1-score of 99.96% for static detection, 97.78% for moving state recognition, and a processing delay of 14.2 milliseconds (resolution 704x576). The deployment on-site shows an 89% reduction in false braking events, a 100% success rate in emergency braking, and a fault rate below 5%.</p></details> | 5 figures,16 pages |
| **[Trajectory-Aware Eligibility Traces for Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11321v3)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy learning from multistep returns is crucial for sample-efficient reinforcement learning, but counteracting off-policy bias without exacerbating variance is challenging. Classically, off-policy bias is corrected in a per-decision manner: past temporal-difference errors are re-weighted by the instantaneous Importance Sampling (IS) ratio after each action via eligibility traces. Many off-policy algorithms rely on this mechanism, along with differing protocols for cutting the IS ratios to combat the variance of the IS estimator. Unfortunately, once a trace has been fully cut, the effect cannot be reversed. This has led to the development of credit-assignment strategies that account for multiple past experiences at a time. These trajectory-aware methods have not been extensively analyzed, and their theoretical justification remains uncertain. In this paper, we propose a multistep operator that can express both per-decision and trajectory-aware methods. We prove convergence conditions for our operator in the tabular setting, establishing the first guarantees for several existing methods as well as many new ones. Finally, we introduce Recency-Bounded Importance Sampling (RBIS), which leverages trajectory awareness to perform robustly across $λ$-values in an off-policy control task.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2023. 18 pages, 4 figures, 1 table.

| **[Surrogate Trajectories Along Probability Flows: Pseudo Markovian Alternative to Mori Zwanzig](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00015v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction techniques have emerged as a powerful paradigm across different fronts of scientific computing. Despite their success, the provided tools and methodologies remain limited if high-dimensional dynamical systems subject to initial uncertainty and/or stochastic noise are encountered; in particular if rare events are of interest. We address this open challenge by borrowing ideas from Mori-Zwanzig formalism and Chorin's optimal prediction method. The novelty of our work lies on employing time-dependent optimal projection of the dynamic on a desired set of resolved variables. We show several theoretical and numerical properties of our model reduction approach. In particular, we show that the devised surrogate trajectories are consistent with the probability flow of the full-order system. Furthermore, we identify the measure underlying the projection through polynomial chaos expansion technique. This allows us to efficiently compute the projection even for trajectories that are initiated on low probability events. Moreover, we investigate the introduced model-reduction error of the surrogate trajectories on a standard setup, characterizing the convergence behaviour of the scheme. Several numerical results highlight the computational advantages of the proposed scheme in comparison to Monte-Carlo and optimal prediction method. Through this framework, we demonstrate that by tracking the measure along with the consistent projection of the dynamic we are able to access accurate estimates of different statistics including observables conditional on a given initial configuration.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoE Pathfinder: Trajectory-driven Expert Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18425v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures used in large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks yet face practical challenges such as deployment complexity and low activation efficiency. Expert pruning has thus emerged as a promising solution to reduce computational overhead and simplify the deployment of MoE models. However, existing expert pruning approaches conventionally rely on local importance metrics and often apply uniform layer-wise pruning, leveraging only partial evaluation signals and overlooking the heterogeneous contributions of experts across layers. To address these limitations, we propose an expert pruning approach based on the trajectory of activated experts across layers, which treats MoE as a weighted computation graph and casts expert selection as a global optimal path planning problem. Within this framework, we integrate complementary importance signals from reconstruction error, routing probabilities, and activation strength at the trajectory level, which naturally yields non-uniform expert retention across layers. Experiments show that our approach achieves superior pruning performance on nearly all tasks compared with most existing approaches.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Joint UAV-UGV Positioning and Trajectory Planning via Meta A3C for Reliable Emergency Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22187v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) has been shown to be an effective method to establish communications in areas affected by disasters. However, ensuring good Quality of Services (QoS) while using as few UAVs as possible also requires optimal positioning and trajectory planning for UAVs and UGVs. This paper proposes a joint UAV-UGV-based positioning and trajectory planning framework for UAVs and UGVs deployment that guarantees optimal QoS for ground users. To model the UGVs' mobility, we introduce a road graph, which directs their movement along valid road segments and adheres to the road network constraints. To solve the sum rate optimization problem, we reformulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) incorporated with meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new environments and dynamic conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed Meta-A3C approach outperforms A3C and DDPG, delivering 13.1\% higher throughput and 49\% faster execution while meeting the QoS requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLaViDA: A Large Language Vision Driving Assistant for Explicit Reasoning and Enhanced Trajectory Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18211v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning is a fundamental yet challenging component of autonomous driving. End-to-end planners frequently falter under adverse weather, unpredictable human behavior, or complex road layouts, primarily because they lack strong generalization or few-shot capabilities beyond their training data. We propose LLaViDA, a Large Language Vision Driving Assistant that leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for object motion prediction, semantic grounding, and chain-of-thought reasoning for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. A two-stage training pipeline--supervised fine-tuning followed by Trajectory Preference Optimization (TPO)--enhances scene understanding and trajectory planning by injecting regression-based supervision, produces a powerful "VLM Trajectory Planner for Autonomous Driving." On the NuScenes benchmark, LLaViDA surpasses state-of-the-art end-to-end and other recent VLM/LLM-based baselines in open-loop trajectory planning task, achieving an average L2 trajectory error of 0.31 m and a collision rate of 0.10% on the NuScenes test set.

| **[Planning as Descent: Goal-Conditioned Latent Trajectory Synthesis in Learned Energy Landscapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17846v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Planning as Descent (PaD), a framework for offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning that grounds trajectory synthesis in verification. Instead of learning a policy or explicit planner, PaD learns a goal-conditioned energy function over entire latent trajectories, assigning low energy to feasible, goal-consistent futures. Planning is realized as gradient-based refinement in this energy landscape, using identical computation during training and inference to reduce train-test mismatch common in decoupled modeling pipelines. PaD is trained via self-supervised hindsight goal relabeling, shaping the energy landscape around the planning dynamics. At inference, multiple trajectory candidates are refined under different temporal hypotheses, and low-energy plans balancing feasibility and efficiency are selected. We evaluate PaD on OGBench cube manipulation tasks. When trained on narrow expert demonstrations, PaD achieves state-of-the-art 95\% success, strongly outperforming prior methods that peak at 68\%. Remarkably, training on noisy, suboptimal data further improves success and plan efficiency, highlighting the benefits of verification-driven planning. Our results suggest learning to evaluate and refine trajectories provides a robust alternative to direct policy learning for offline, reward-free planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Dataset of Individual Daily Trajectories for City-Scale Mobility Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17239v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban mobility data are indispensable for urban planning, transportation demand forecasting, pandemic modeling, and many other applications; however, individual mobile phone-derived Global Positioning System traces cannot generally be shared with third parties owing to severe re-identification risks. Aggregated records, such as origin-destination (OD) matrices, offer partial insights but fail to capture the key behavioral properties of daily human movement, limiting realistic city-scale analyses. This study presents a privacy-preserving synthetic mobility dataset that reconstructs daily trajectories from aggregated inputs. The proposed method integrates OD flows with two complementary behavioral constraints: (1) dwell-travel time quantiles that are available only as coarse summary statistics and (2) the universal law for the daily distribution of the number of visited locations. Embedding these elements in a multi-objective optimization framework enables the reproduction of realistic distributions of human mobility while ensuring that no personal identifiers are required. The proposed framework is validated in two contrasting regions of Japan: (1) the 23 special wards of Tokyo, representing a dense metropolitan environment; and (2) Fukuoka Prefecture, where urban and suburban mobility patterns coexist. The resulting synthetic mobility data reproduce dwell-travel time and visit frequency distributions with high fidelity, while deviations in OD consistency remain within the natural range of daily fluctuations. The results of this study establish a practical synthesis pathway under real-world constraints, providing governments, urban planners, and industries with scalable access to high-resolution mobility data for reliable analytics without the need for sensitive personal records, and supporting practical deployments in policy and commercial domains.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Tracing the Roots: Leveraging Temporal Dynamics in Diffusion Trajectories for Origin Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07449v3)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have transformed image synthesis through iterative denoising, by defining trajectories from noise to coherent data. While their capabilities are widely celebrated, a critical challenge remains unaddressed: ensuring responsible use by verifying whether an image originates from a model's training set, its novel generations or external sources. We introduce a framework that analyzes diffusion trajectories for this purpose. Specifically, we demonstrate that temporal dynamics across the entire trajectory allow for more robust classification and challenge the widely-adopted "Goldilocks zone" conjecture, which posits that membership inference is effective only within narrow denoising stages. More fundamentally, we expose critical flaws in current membership inference practices by showing that representative methods fail under distribution shifts or when model-generated data is present. For model attribution, we demonstrate a first white-box approach directly applicable to diffusion. Ultimately, we propose the unification of data provenance into a single, cohesive framework tailored to modern generative systems.</p></details> |  |

The resulting videos demonstrate not only temporal coherence but also emergent consistency, preserving object identity and scene despite temporary disappearance.

Existing real datasets fit real-world scenarios, capturing authentic road object behaviors, however, they typically lack precise ground-truth annotations. In contrast, synthetic datasets play a crucial role, allowing for the annotation of a large number of frames without additional costs or extra time. However, a general drawback of synthetic datasets is the lack of realistic vehicle motion, since trajectories are generated using AI models or rule-based systems. In this work, we introduce R3ST (Realistic 3D Synthetic Trajectories), a synthetic dataset that overcomes this limitation by generating a synthetic 3D environment and integrating real-world trajectories derived from SinD, a bird's-eye-view dataset recorded from drone footage. The proposed dataset closes the gap between synthetic data and realistic trajectories, advancing the research in trajectory forecasting of road vehicles, offering both accurate multimodal ground-truth annotations and authentic human-driven vehicle trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[dLITE: Differentiable Lighting-Informed Trajectory Evaluation for On-Orbit Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16011v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual inspection of space-borne assets is of increasing interest to spacecraft operators looking to plan maintenance, characterise damage, and extend the life of high-value satellites in orbit. The environment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) presents unique challenges when planning inspection operations that maximise visibility, information, and data quality. Specular reflection of sunlight from spacecraft bodies, self-shadowing, and dynamic lighting in LEO significantly impact the quality of data captured throughout an orbit. This is exacerbated by the relative motion between spacecraft, which introduces variable imaging distances and attitudes during inspection. Planning inspection trajectories with the aide of simulation is a common approach. However, the ability to design and optimise an inspection trajectory specifically to improve the resulting image quality in proximity operations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present $\partial$LITE, an end-to-end differentiable simulation pipeline for on-orbit inspection operations. We leverage state-of-the-art differentiable rendering tools and a custom orbit propagator to enable end-to-end optimisation of orbital parameters based on visual sensor data. $\partial$LITE enables us to automatically design non-obvious trajectories, vastly improving the quality and usefulness of attained data. To our knowledge, our differentiable inspection-planning pipeline is the first of its kind and provides new insights into modern computational approaches to spacecraft mission planning.

However, existing learning-based methods exhibit three key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of trajectory semantics and hierarchy, lacking both movement dynamics extraction and multi-scale structural representation; (2) high computational costs due to point-wise encoding; and (3) use of physically implausible augmentations that distort trajectory semantics. To address these issues, we propose MovSemCL, a movement-semantics contrastive learning framework for trajectory similarity computation. MovSemCL first transforms raw GPS trajectories into movement-semantics features and then segments them into patches. Next, MovSemCL employs intra- and inter-patch attentions to encode local as well as global trajectory patterns, enabling efficient hierarchical representation and reducing computational costs. Moreover, MovSemCL includes a curvature-guided augmentation strategy that preserves informative segments (e.g., turns and intersections) and masks redundant ones, generating physically plausible augmented views. Experiments on real-world datasets show that MovSemCL is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods, achieving mean ranks close to the ideal value of 1 at similarity search tasks and improvements by up to 20.3% at heuristic approximation, while reducing inference latency by up to 43.4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures; accepted by AAAI 2026 as an Oral paper</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs. Extensive experiments on both diffusion-based and flow-based models demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our Pro-GRPO framework.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

In contrast to methods that rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate discrete occupancy tokens, which inherently limit representational capacity, our approach predicts multi-frame future occupancy in an end-to-end manner directly from raw image features. Inspired by the success of attention-based transformer architectures in foundational vision and language models such as GPT and VGGT, we employ a sparse occupancy representation that bypasses the intermediate bird's eye view (BEV) projection and its explicit geometric priors. This design allows the transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependencies more effectively. By avoiding both the finite-capacity constraint of discrete tokenization and the structural limitations of BEV representations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting, outperforming existing approaches by a significant margin. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust scene dynamics understanding, consistently delivering high accuracy under arbitrary future trajectory conditioning.</p></details> |  |

However, their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations poses significant risks, especially in Federated Learning (FL) settings where identical models are distributed across thousands of clients. While adversarial training is a strong defense, it is difficult to apply in FL due to strict client-data privacy constraints and the limited compute available on edge devices. In this work, we introduce TrajSyn, a privacy-preserving framework that enables effective server-side adversarial training by synthesizing a proxy dataset from the trajectories of client model updates, without accessing raw client data. We show that TrajSyn consistently improves adversarial robustness on image classification benchmarks with no extra compute burden on the client device.</p></details> |  |

Towards that end, the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has emerged as an essential architecture for enabling ubiquitous UAV connectivity. To address the pronounced disparities in coverage and signal characteristics across heterogeneous networks, this paper formulates UAV mobility management in SAGIN as a constrained multi-objective joint optimization problem. The formulation couples discrete link selection with continuous trajectory optimization. Building on this, we propose a two-level multi-agent hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework that decomposes the problem into two alternately solvable subproblems. To map complex link selection decisions into a compact discrete action space, we conceive a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm in the top-level, which achieves stable and high-quality policy learning through double Q-value estimation. To handle the continuous trajectory action space while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints, we integrate the maximum-entropy mechanism of the soft actor-critic (SAC) and employ a Lagrangian-based constrained SAC (CSAC) algorithm in the lower-level that dynamically adjusts the Lagrange multipliers to balance constraint satisfaction and policy optimization. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be extended to multi-UAV scenarios under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, which enables more generalizable policies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms existing benchmarks in throughput, link switching frequency and QoS satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions.

However, datasets containing suboptimal and fragmented trajectories present challenges for reward propagation, resulting in inaccurate value estimation and degraded policy performance. While trajectory stitching via generative models offers a promising solution, existing augmentation methods frequently produce trajectories that are either confined to the support of the behavior policy or violate the underlying dynamics, thereby limiting their effectiveness for policy improvement. We propose ASTRO, a data augmentation framework that generates distributionally novel and dynamics-consistent trajectories for offline RL. ASTRO first learns a temporal-distance representation to identify distinct and reachable stitch targets. We then employ a dynamics-guided stitch planner that adaptively generates connecting action sequences via Rollout Deviation Feedback, defined as the gap between target state sequence and the actual arrived state sequence by executing predicted actions, to improve trajectory stitching's feasibility and reachability. This approach facilitates effective augmentation through stitching and ultimately enhances policy learning. ASTRO outperforms prior offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms, achieving notable performance gain on the challenging OGBench suite and demonstrating consistent improvements on standard offline RL benchmarks such as D4RL.</p></details> |  |

Recent works on trajectory-conditioned video generation address this gap but often rely on 2D trajectories or single modality conditioning, which restricts their ability to produce controllable and consistent robotic demonstrations. We present DRAW2ACT, a depth-aware trajectory-conditioned video generation framework that extracts multiple orthogonal representations from the input trajectory, capturing depth, semantics, shape and motion, and injects them into the diffusion model. Moreover, we propose to jointly generate spatially aligned RGB and depth videos, leveraging cross-modality attention mechanisms and depth supervision to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency. Finally, we introduce a multimodal policy model conditioned on the generated RGB and depth sequences to regress the robot's joint angles. Experiments on Bridge V2, Berkeley Autolab, and simulation benchmarks show that DRAW2ACT achieves superior visual fidelity and consistency while yielding higher manipulation success rates compared to existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Tracking for Multi-Manipulator Systems in Constrained Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14206v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of cooperative manipulation by a mobile multi-manipulator system operating in obstacle-cluttered and highly constrained environments under spatio-temporal task specifications. The task requires transporting a grasped object while respecting both continuous robot dynamics and discrete geometric constraints arising from obstacles and narrow passages. To address this hybrid structure, we propose a multi-rate planning and control framework that combines offline generation of an STL-satisfying object trajectory and collision-free base footprints with online constrained inverse kinematics and continuous-time feedback control. The resulting closed-loop system enables coordinated reconfiguration of multiple manipulators while tracking the desired object motion. The approach is evaluated in high-fidelity physics simulations using three Franka Emika Panda mobile manipulators rigidly grasping an object.</p></details> |  |
| **[DTRec: Learning Dynamic Reasoning Trajectories for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14036v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by advances in LLMs, reasoning-enhanced sequential recommendation performs multi-step deliberation before making final predictions, unlocking greater potential for capturing user preferences. However, current methods are constrained by static reasoning trajectories that are ill-suited for the diverse complexity of user behaviors. They suffer from two key limitations: (1) a static reasoning direction, which uses flat supervision signals misaligned with human-like hierarchical reasoning, and (2) a fixed reasoning depth, which inefficiently applies the same computational effort to all users, regardless of pattern complexity. These rigidity lead to suboptimal performance and significant computational waste. To overcome these challenges, we propose DTRec, a novel and effective framework that explores the Dynamic reasoning Trajectory for Sequential Recommendation along both direction and depth. To guide the direction, we develop Hierarchical Process Supervision (HPS), which provides coarse-to-fine supervisory signals to emulate the natural, progressive refinement of human cognitive processes. To optimize the depth, we introduce the Adaptive Reasoning Halting (ARH) mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of reasoning steps by jointly monitoring three indicators. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving up to a 24.5% performance improvement over strong baselines while simultaneously reducing computational cost by up to 41.6%.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Stable Trajectory Clustering: An Efficient Split and Merge Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21808v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering algorithms fundamentally group data points by characteristics to identify patterns. Over the past two decades, researchers have extended these methods to analyze trajectories of humans, animals, and vehicles, studying their behavior and movement across applications. \noindent This paper presents whole-trajectory clustering and sub-trajectory clustering algorithms based on DBSCAN line segment clustering, which encompasses two key events: split and merge of line segments. The events are utilized to capture object movement history based on the average Euclidean distance between line segments. In this framework, whole-trajectory clustering considers entire entities' trajectories, whereas sub-trajectory clustering employs a sliding window model to identify local similarity patterns. Many existing trajectory clustering algorithms respond to temporary anomalies in data by splitting trajectories, which often obscures otherwise consistent clustering patterns and leads to less reliable insights. To address this, we introduce the stable trajectory clustering algorithm, which leverages the mean absolute deviation concept to demonstrate that selective omission of transient deviations not only preserves the integrity of clusters but also improves their stability and interpretability. We evaluate all proposed algorithms on real trajectory datasets to illustrate their effectiveness and sensitivity to parameter variations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal parallelisation of continuous-time maximum-a-posteriori trajectory estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13319v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a parallel-in-time method for computing continuous-time maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) trajectory estimates of the states of partially observed stochastic differential equations (SDEs), with the goal of improving computational speed on parallel architectures. The MAP estimation problem is reformulated as a continuous-time optimal control problem based on the Onsager-Machlup functional. This reformulation enables the use of a previously proposed parallel-in-time solution for optimal control problems, which we adapt to the current problem. The structure of the resulting optimal control problem admits a parallel solution based on parallel associative scan algorithms. In the linear Gaussian special case, it yields a parallel Kalman-Bucy filter and a parallel continuous-time Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. These linear computational methods are further extended to nonlinear continuous-time state-space models through Taylor expansions. We also present the corresponding parallel two-filter smoother. The graphics processing unit (GPU) experiments on linear and nonlinear models demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a significant speedup in computations while maintaining the accuracy of sequential algorithms.</p></details> |  |

It includes four main parts: (1) Automatic spring-mass trajectory library generation; (2) Deadbeat control gain library generation through an actively controlled template model that resembles the whole-body dynamics well; (3) Trajectory selection policy development for step adaptation; (4) Mapping spring-mass trajectories to a humanoid model through a whole-body control (WBC) framework also accounting for closed-kinematic chain systems, self collisions, and reactive limb swinging. We show the inclusiveness and the robustness of the proposed framework through various challenging and agile behaviors such as running through randomly generated stepping stones, jumping over random obstacles, performing slalom motions, changing the running direction suddenly with a random leg, and rejecting significant disturbances and uncertainties through the MuJoCo physics simulator. We also perform additional simulations under a comprehensive set of uncertainties and noise to better justify the proposed method's robustness to real-world challenges, including signal noise, imprecision, modeling errors, and delays. All the aforementioned behaviors are performed with a single library and the same set of WBC control parameters without additional tuning. The spring-mass and the deadbeat control gain library are automatically computed in 4.5 seconds in total for 315 different trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Biomimetic Intelligence and Robotics.

We address vessel destination estimation using global-scope AIS data by proposing a differentiated approach that recasts long port-to-port trajectories as a nested sequence structure. Using spatial grids, this method mitigates spatio-temporal bias while preserving detailed resolution. We introduce a novel deep learning architecture, WAY, designed to process these reformulated trajectories for long-term destination estimation days to weeks in advance. WAY comprises a trajectory representation layer and Channel-Aggregative Sequential Processing (CASP) blocks. The representation layer generates multi-channel vector sequences from kinematic and non-kinematic features. CASP blocks utilize multi-headed channel- and self-attention for aggregation and sequential information delivery. Additionally, we propose a task-specialized Gradient Dropout (GD) technique to enable many-to-many training on single labels, preventing biased feedback surges by stochastically blocking gradient flow based on sample length. Experiments on 5-year AIS data demonstrate WAY's superiority over conventional spatial grid-based approaches regardless of trajectory progression. Results further confirm that adopting GD leads to performance gains. Finally, we explore WAY's potential for real-world application through multitask learning for ETA estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems (TAES)</p></details> |

In realistic FedAvg scenarios with multi-step updates, existing surrogate methods like SME rely on linear interpolation to approximate client trajectories for privacy leakage. However, we demonstrate that linear assumptions fundamentally underestimate SGD's nonlinear complexity, encountering irreducible approximation barriers in non-convex landscapes with only one-dimensional expressiveness. We propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first framework introducing learnable quadratic Bézier curves for trajectory modeling in GIAs against FL. NL-SME leverages $|w|+1$-dimensional control point parameterization combined with dvec scaling and regularization mechanisms to achieve superior approximation accuracy. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST demonstrate NL-SME significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving 94\%--98\% performance gaps and order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining computational efficiency. This work exposes critical privacy vulnerabilities in FL's multi-step paradigm and provides insights for robust defense development.</p></details> |  |

Vanilla PINNs often under-enforce this constraint and produce unstable controls. We propose a Multi-Trajectory PINN (MT-PINN) that adds a rollout-based trajectory loss and propagates a terminal penalty on terminal inventory via backpropagation-through-time, directly enforcing zero terminal inventory. A lightweight lambda-curriculum is adopted to stabilize training as the state expands from a risk-neutral reduced HJB to a risk-averse HJB. On the Gatheral-Schied single-asset model, MT-PINN aligns closely with their derived closed-form solutions and concentrates terminal inventory tightly around zero while reducing errors along optimal paths. We apply MT-PINNs on SPY intraday data, matching TWAP when risk-neutral, and achieving lower exposure and competitive costs, especially in falling windows, for higher risk-aversion.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 19 figures.

Accurate prediction enables realistic simulation and strategic understanding of gameplay evolution. Most existing models are evaluated solely on per-agent accuracy metrics (minADE, minFDE), which assess each agent independently on its best-of-k prediction. However these metrics overlook whether the model learns which predicted trajectories can jointly form a plausible multi-agent future. Many state-of-the-art models are designed and optimized primarily based on these metrics. As a result, they may underperform on joint predictions and also fail to generate coherent, interpretable multi-agent scenarios in team sports. We propose CausalTraj, a temporally causal, likelihood-based model that is built to generate jointly probable multi-agent trajectory forecasts. To better assess collective modeling capability, we emphasize joint metrics (minJADE, minJFDE) that measure joint accuracy across agents within the best generated scenario sample. Evaluated on the NBA SportVU, Basketball-U, and Football-U datasets, CausalTraj achieves competitive per-agent accuracy and the best recorded results on joint metrics, while yielding qualitatively coherent and realistic gameplay evolutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, accepted to the AI4TS Workshop at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

It contains over 440,000 facial trajectories in total, among which more than 52,000 are longer than 10 frames, including 68 manually reviewed trajectories that span the entire 150 frames. To the best of our knowledge, PoreTrack3D is the first benchmark dataset to capture both traditional facial landmarks and pore-scale keypoints trajectory, advancing the study of fine-grained facial expressions through the analysis of subtle skin-surface motion. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting methods on PoreTrack3D, establishing the first performance baseline in this domain. Overall, the pipeline developed for this benchmark dataset's creation establishes a new framework for high-fidelity facial motion capture and dynamic 3D reconstruction.

| **[Measuring What Matters: Scenario-Driven Evaluation for Trajectory Predictors in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12211v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Being able to anticipate the motion of surrounding agents is essential for the safe operation of autonomous driving systems in dynamic situations. While various methods have been proposed for trajectory prediction, the current evaluation practices still rely on error-based metrics (e.g., ADE, FDE), which reveal the accuracy from a post-hoc view but ignore the actual effect the predictor brings to the self-driving vehicles (SDVs), especially in complex interactive scenarios: a high-quality predictor not only chases accuracy, but should also captures all possible directions a neighbor agent might move, to support the SDVs' cautious decision-making. Given that the existing metrics hardly account for this standard, in our work, we propose a comprehensive pipeline that adaptively evaluates the predictor's performance by two dimensions: accuracy and diversity. Based on the criticality of the driving scenario, these two dimensions are dynamically combined and result in a final score for the predictor's performance. Extensive experiments on a closed-loop benchmark using real-world datasets show that our pipeline yields a more reasonable evaluation than traditional metrics by better reflecting the correlation of the predictors' evaluation with the autonomous vehicles' driving performance. This evaluation pipeline shows a robust way to select a predictor that potentially contributes most to the SDV's driving performance.</p></details> | 9 Pages, 8 Figures |

Modern trajectory planning techniques primarily use numerical optimization, as they enable the systematic computation of high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints. However, stringent requirements on computation time and the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework called STITCHER that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long-range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. STITCHER outperforms modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is performed to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, along with a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners. Simulation tests show that safe trajectories can be created within a few milliseconds for paths that span the entirety of two 50 m x 50 m environments. Hardware tests with a custom quadrotor verify that STITCHER can produce trackable paths in real-time while respecting nonconvex constraints, such as limits on tilt angle and motor forces, which are otherwise hard to include in optimization-based planners.</p></details> |  |

We present Touchscreen Electromagnetic Side-channel Leakage Attack (TESLA), a non-contact attack framework that captures EM signals generated during on-screen writing and regresses them into two-dimensional (2D) handwriting trajectories in real time. Extensive evaluations across a variety of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) smartphones show that TESLA achieves 77% character recognition accuracy and a Jaccard index of 0.74, demonstrating its capability to recover highly recognizable motion trajectories that closely resemble the original handwriting under realistic attack conditions.</p></details> |  |

We propose the Plasticity-Ceiling Framework to theoretically ground this landscape, decomposing performance into foundational SFT performance and the subsequent RL plasticity. Through extensive benchmarking, we establish the Sequential SFT-then-RL pipeline as the superior standard, overcoming the stability deficits of synchronized approaches. Furthermore, we derive precise scaling guidelines: (1) Transitioning to RL at the SFT Stable or Mild Overfitting Sub-phase maximizes the final ceiling by securing foundational SFT performance without compromising RL plasticity; (2) Refuting ``Less is More'' in the context of SFT-then-RL scaling, we demonstrate that Data Scale determines the primary post-training potential, while Trajectory Difficulty acts as a performance multiplier; and (3) Identifying that the Minimum SFT Validation Loss serves as a robust indicator for selecting the expert trajectories that maximize the final performance ceiling. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for maximizing the value extracted from expert trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, under review</p></details> |

This study evaluates an AI-guided student support system at a large university using doubly robust propensity score matching. We advance the methodology for learning analytics evaluation by leveraging time-aligned, dynamic AI probability of success scores to match 1,859 treated students to controls, thereby mitigating the selection and immortal time biases often overlooked in observational studies. Results indicate that the intervention effectively stabilised precarious trajectories, and compared to the control group, supported students significantly reduced their course failure rates and achieved higher cumulative grades. However, effects on the speed of qualification completion were positive but statistically constrained. We interpreted these findings through Activity Theory, framing the intervention as a socio-technical brake that interrupts and slows the accumulation of academic failure among at-risk students. The student support-AI configuration successfully resolved the primary contradiction of immediate academic risk, but secondary contradictions within institutional structures limited the acceleration of degree completion. We conclude that while AI-enabled support effectively arrests decline, translating this stability into faster progression requires aligning intervention strategies with broader institutional governance.</p></details> |  |

Current protection methods are limited to passively degrading image quality, failing to achieve stable control. While Targeted Data Protection (TDP) offers a promising paradigm for active redirection toward user-specified target concepts, existing TDP attempts suffer from poor controllability due to snapshot-matching approaches that fail to account for complete learning dynamics. We introduce TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations), the first method to successfully achieve effective TDP by controlling the entire training trajectory. Unlike snapshot-based methods whose protective influence is easily diluted as training progresses, TAFAP employs trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent, verifiable transformations throughout fine-tuning. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over both identity and visual patterns. TAFAP significantly outperforms existing TDP attempts, achieving robust redirection toward target concepts while maintaining high image quality. This work enables verifiable safeguards and provides a new framework for controlling and tracing alterations in diffusion model outputs.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion. Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.</p></details> |  |

While recent progress in nonconvex guidance and control is paving the way for onboard autonomous trajectory optimization, these methods still rely on extensive expert input (e.g., waypoints, constraints, mission timelines, etc.), which limits the operational scalability in real rendezvous missions. This paper introduces SAGES (Semantic Autonomous Guidance Engine for Space), a trajectory-generation framework that translates natural-language commands into spacecraft trajectories that reflect high-level intent while respecting nonconvex constraints. Experiments in two settings -- fault-tolerant proximity operations with continuous-time constraint enforcement and a free-flying robotic platform -- demonstrate that SAGES reliably produces trajectories aligned with human commands, achieving over 90% semantic-behavioral consistency across diverse behavior modes. Ultimately, this work marks an initial step toward language-conditioned, constraint-aware spacecraft trajectory generation, enabling operators to interactively guide both safety and behavior through intuitive natural-language commands with reduced expert burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 12 figures.

| **[FAST: Foreground-aware Diffusion with Accelerated Sampling Trajectory for Segmentation-oriented Anomaly Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20295v4)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations, yet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label. Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step, preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream segmentation tasks. We release the code at: https://github.com/Chhro123/fast-foreground-aware-anomaly-synthesis.</p></details> |  |

Standard world models typically rely on action-conditioned trajectories, which limits effectiveness when action labels are scarce. We introduce a family of latent-action world models that jointly use action-conditioned and action-free data by learning a shared latent action representation. This latent space aligns observed control signals with actions inferred from passive observations, enabling a single dynamics model to train on large-scale unlabeled trajectories while requiring only a small set of action-labeled ones. We use the latent-action world model to learn a latent-action policy through offline reinforcement learning (RL), thereby bridging two traditionally separate domains: offline RL, which typically relies on action-conditioned data, and action-free training, which is rarely used with subsequent RL. On the DeepMind Control Suite, our approach achieves strong performance while using about an order of magnitude fewer action-labeled samples than purely action-conditioned baselines. These results show that latent actions enable training on both passive and interactive data, which makes world models learn more efficiently.</p></details> |  |

Incorporating controllability in video generation further adds to the complexity. Existing controllable video generation approaches face a trade-off: sparse controls like keypoint trajectories are easy to specify but lack instance-awareness, while dense signals such as optical flow, depths or 3D meshes are informative but costly to obtain. We propose VHOI, a two-stage framework that first densifies sparse trajectories into HOI mask sequences, and then fine-tunes a video diffusion model conditioned on these dense masks. We introduce a novel HOI-aware motion representation that uses color encodings to distinguish not only human and object motion, but also body-part-specific dynamics. This design incorporates a human prior into the conditioning signal and strengthens the model's ability to understand and generate realistic HOI dynamics. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in controllable HOI video generation. VHOI is not limited to interaction-only scenarios and can also generate full human navigation leading up to object interactions in an end-to-end manner.

Current visual navigation methods are typically limited to simulated or off-street environments, and often rely on precise goal formats, such as specific coordinates or images. This limits their effectiveness for autonomous agents like last-mile delivery robots navigating unfamiliar cities. To address these limitations, we introduce UrbanNav, a scalable framework that trains embodied agents to follow free-form language instructions in diverse urban settings. Leveraging web-scale city walking videos, we develop an scalable annotation pipeline that aligns human navigation trajectories with language instructions grounded in real-world landmarks. UrbanNav encompasses over 1,500 hours of navigation data and 3 million instruction-trajectory-landmark triplets, capturing a wide range of urban scenarios. Our model learns robust navigation policies to tackle complex urban scenarios, demonstrating superior spatial reasoning, robustness to noisy instructions, and generalization to unseen urban settings. Experimental results show that UrbanNav significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the potential of large-scale web video data to enable language-guided, real-world urban navigation for embodied agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[BridgeDrive: Diffusion Bridge Policy for Closed-Loop Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23589v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans, appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 7.72% over prior arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Traditional roadside video collection often fails in dense mixed traffic due to occlusion, limited viewing angles, and irregular vehicle movements. UAV-based recording provides a top-down perspective that reduces these issues and captures rich spatial and temporal dynamics. The datasets described here were extracted using the Data from Sky (DFS) platform and validated against manual counts, space mean speeds, and probe trajectories in earlier work. Each dataset contains time-stamped vehicle positions, speeds, longitudinal and lateral accelerations, and vehicle classifications at a resolution of 30 frames per second. Data were collected at six mid-block locations in the national capital region of India, covering diverse traffic compositions and density levels. Exploratory analyses highlight key behavioural patterns, including lane-keeping preferences, speed distributions, and lateral manoeuvres typical of heterogeneous and area-based traffic settings. These datasets are intended as a resource for the global research community to support simulation modelling, safety assessment, and behavioural studies under area-based traffic conditions. By making these empirical datasets openly available, this work offers researchers a unique opportunity to develop, test, and validate models that more accurately represent complex urban traffic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper presents basic statistics and trends in empirically observed data from highly heterogeneous and area-based traffic while offering the datasets open source for researchers and practitioners</p></details> |
| **[HeLoFusion: An Efficient and Scalable Encoder for Modeling Heterogeneous and Multi-Scale Interactions in Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11719v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory prediction in autonomous driving requires a comprehensive understanding of complex social dynamics. Existing methods, however, often struggle to capture the full richness of these dynamics, particularly the co-existence of multi-scale interactions and the diverse behaviors of heterogeneous agents. To address these challenges, this paper introduces HeLoFusion, an efficient and scalable encoder for modeling heterogeneous and multi-scale agent interactions. Instead of relying on global context, HeLoFusion constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each agent, allowing it to effectively model both direct pairwise dependencies and complex group-wise interactions (\textit{e.g.}, platooning vehicles or pedestrian crowds). Furthermore, HeLoFusion tackles the critical challenge of agent heterogeneity through an aggregation-decomposition message-passing scheme and type-specific feature networks, enabling it to learn nuanced, type-dependent interaction patterns. This locality-focused approach enables a principled representation of multi-level social context, yielding powerful and expressive agent embeddings. On the challenging Waymo Open Motion Dataset, HeLoFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting new benchmarks for key metrics including Soft mAP and minADE. Our work demonstrates that a locality-grounded architecture, which explicitly models multi-scale and heterogeneous interactions, is a highly effective strategy for advancing motion forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[A data-driven approach to inferring travel trajectory during peak hours in urban rail transit systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14728v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refined trajectory inference of urban rail transit is of great significance to the operation organization. In this paper, we develop a fully data-driven approach to inferring individual travel trajectories in urban rail transit systems. It utilizes data from the Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) systems to infer key trajectory elements, such as selected train, access/egress time, and transfer time. The approach includes establishing train alternative sets based on spatio-temporal constraints, data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, and trave l trajectory construction. To realize data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, a data-driven parameter estimation method based on KL divergence combined with EM algorithm (KLEM) was proposed. This method eliminates the reliance on external or survey data for parameter fitting, enhancing the robustness and applicability of the model. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of using synthetic data to validate the result, this paper employs real individual travel trajectory data for verification. The results show that the approach developed in this paper can achieve high-precision passenger trajectory inference, with an accuracy rate of over 90% in urban rail transit travel trajectory inference during peak hours.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wan-Move: Motion-controllable Video Generation via Latent Trajectory Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08765v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Wan-Move, a simple and scalable framework that brings motion control to video generative models. Existing motion-controllable methods typically suffer from coarse control granularity and limited scalability, leaving their outputs insufficient for practical use. We narrow this gap by achieving precise and high-quality motion control. Our core idea is to directly make the original condition features motion-aware for guiding video synthesis. To this end, we first represent object motions with dense point trajectories, allowing fine-grained control over the scene. We then project these trajectories into latent space and propagate the first frame's features along each trajectory, producing an aligned spatiotemporal feature map that tells how each scene element should move. This feature map serves as the updated latent condition, which is naturally integrated into the off-the-shelf image-to-video model, e.g., Wan-I2V-14B, as motion guidance without any architecture change. It removes the need for auxiliary motion encoders and makes fine-tuning base models easily scalable. Through scaled training, Wan-Move generates 5-second, 480p videos whose motion controllability rivals Kling 1.5 Pro's commercial Motion Brush, as indicated by user studies. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further design MoveBench, a rigorously curated benchmark featuring diverse content categories and hybrid-verified annotations. It is distinguished by larger data volume, longer video durations, and high-quality motion annotations. Extensive experiments on MoveBench and the public dataset consistently show Wan-Move's superior motion quality. Code, models, and benchmark data are made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neurl...</summary><p>NeurlPS 2025.

| **[Gradient-Informed Monte Carlo Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models for Low-Thrust Trajectory Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08705v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preliminary mission design of low-thrust spacecraft trajectories in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem is a global search characterized by a complex objective landscape and numerous local minima. Formulating the problem as sampling from an unnormalized distribution supported on neighborhoods of locally optimal solutions, provides the opportunity to deploy Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and generative machine learning. In this work, we extend our previous self-supervised diffusion model fine-tuning framework to employ gradient-informed Markov chain Monte Carlo. We compare two algorithms - the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo - both initialized from a distribution learned by a diffusion model. Derivatives of an objective function that balances fuel consumption, time of flight and constraint violations are computed analytically using state transition matrices. We show that incorporating the gradient drift term accelerates mixing and improves convergence of the Markov chain for a multi-revolution transfer in the Saturn-Titan system. Among the evaluated methods, MALA provides the best trade-off between performance and computational cost. Starting from samples generated by a baseline diffusion model trained on a related transfer, MALA explicitly targets Pareto-optimal solutions. Compared to a random walk Metropolis algorithm, it increases the feasibility rate from 17.34% to 63.01% and produces a denser, more diverse coverage of the Pareto front. By fine-tuning a diffusion model on the generated samples and associated reward values with reward-weighted likelihood maximization, we learn the global solution structure of the problem and eliminate the need for a tedious separate data generation phase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ergodic Trajectory Planning with Dynamic Sensor Footprints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08661v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of trajectory planning for information gathering with a dynamic and resolution-varying sensor footprint. Ergodic planning offers a principled framework that balances exploration (visiting all areas) and exploitation (focusing on high-information regions) by planning trajectories such that the time spent in a region is proportional to the amount of information in that region. Existing ergodic planning often oversimplifies the sensing model by assuming a point sensor or a footprint with constant shape and resolution. In practice, the sensor footprint can drastically change over time as the robot moves, such as aerial robots equipped with downward-facing cameras, whose field of view depends on the orientation and altitude. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new metric that accounts for dynamic sensor footprints, analyze the theoretic local optimality conditions, and propose numerical trajectory optimization algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can simultaneously optimize both the trajectories and sensor footprints, with up to an order of magnitude better ergodicity than conventional methods. We also deploy our approach in a multi-drone system to ergodically cover an object in 3D space.</p></details> | 12 figures |

We treat each task as a trajectory generation scenario defined by a specific number of drone-to-drone interactions. To model relationships across scenarios, we employ Multi-Task Gaussian Processes, which capture shared structure across tasks and enable efficient information transfer during optimization. We compare two strategies: optimizing the average mission time across all tasks and optimizing each task individually. Through a comprehensive simulation campaign, we show that single-task optimization leads to progressively shorter mission times as swarm size grows, but requires significantly more optimization time than the average-task approach.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we aim to explore the potential of MLLMs for audio deepfake detection. Combining audio inputs with a range of text prompts as queries to find out the viability of MLLMs to learn robust representations across modalities for audio deepfake detection. Therefore, we attempt to explore text-aware and context-rich, question-answer based prompts with binary decisions. We hypothesise that such a feature-guided reasoning will help in facilitating deeper multimodal understanding and enable robust feature learning for audio deepfake detection. We evaluate the performance of two MLLMs, Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct and SALMONN, in two evaluation modes: (a) zero-shot and (b) fine-tuned. Our experiments demonstrate that combining audio with a multi-prompt approach could be a viable way forward for audio deepfake detection. Our experiments show that the models perform poorly without task-specific training and struggle to generalise to out-of-domain data. However, they achieve good performance on in-domain data with minimal supervision, indicating promising potential for audio deepfake detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCB 2025</p></details> |
| **[C-VARC: A Large-Scale Chinese Value Rule Corpus for Value Alignment of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01495v5)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) align with mainstream human values and ethical norms is crucial for the safe and sustainable development of AI. Current value evaluation and alignment are constrained by Western cultural bias and incomplete domestic frameworks reliant on non-native rules; furthermore, the lack of scalable, rule-driven scenario generation methods makes evaluations costly and inadequate across diverse cultural contexts. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical value framework grounded in core Chinese values, encompassing three main dimensions, 12 core values, and 50 derived values. Based on this framework, we construct a large-scale Chinese Value Rule Corpus (C-VARC) containing over 250,000 value rules enhanced and expanded through human annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that scenarios guided by C-VARC exhibit clearer value boundaries and greater content diversity compared to those produced through direct generation. In the evaluation across six sensitive themes (e.g., surrogacy, suicide), seven mainstream LLMs preferred C-VARC generated options in over 70.5% of cases, while five Chinese human annotators showed an 87.5% alignment with C-VARC, confirming its universality, cultural relevance, and strong alignment with Chinese values. Additionally, we construct 400,000 rule-based moral dilemma scenarios that objectively capture nuanced distinctions in conflicting value prioritization across 17 LLMs. Our work establishes a culturally-adaptive benchmarking framework for comprehensive value evaluation and alignment, representing Chinese characteristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memory Bank Compression for Continual Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00756v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a mainstay for many everyday applications. However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations. Experiments with benchmark question-answering datasets demonstrate that MBC reduces the memory bank size to 0.3% when compared against the most competitive baseline, while maintaining high retention accuracy during online adaptation learning.

| **[Exploring the Performance of Large Language Models on Subjective Span Identification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00736v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying relevant text spans is important for several downstream tasks in NLP, as it contributes to model explainability. While most span identification approaches rely on relatively smaller pre-trained language models like BERT, a few recent approaches have leveraged the latest generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the task. Current work has focused on explicit span identification like Named Entity Recognition (NER), while more subjective span identification with LLMs in tasks like Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has been underexplored. In this paper, we fill this important gap by presenting an evaluation of the performance of various LLMs on text span identification in three popular tasks, namely sentiment analysis, offensive language identification, and claim verification. We explore several LLM strategies like instruction tuning, in-context learning, and chain of thought. Our results indicate underlying relationships within text aid LLMs in identifying precise text spans.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Curse of Depth in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05795v3)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the Curse of Depth, a concept that highlights, explains, and addresses the recent observation in modern Large Language Models (LLMs) where nearly half of the layers are less effective than expected. We first confirm the wide existence of this phenomenon across the most popular families of LLMs such as Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, and Qwen. Our analysis, theoretically and empirically, identifies that the underlying reason for the ineffectiveness of deep layers in LLMs is the widespread usage of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). While Pre-LN stabilizes the training of Transformer LLMs, its output variance exponentially grows with the model depth, which undesirably causes the derivative of the deep Transformer blocks to be an identity matrix, and therefore barely contributes to the training. To resolve this training pitfall, we propose LayerNorm Scaling (LNS), which scales the variance of output of the layer normalization inversely by the square root of its depth. This simple modification mitigates the output variance explosion of deeper Transformer layers, improving their contribution. Across a wide range of model sizes (130M to 7B), our experiments show that LNS consistently outperforms previous normalization and scaling techniques in enhancing LLM pre-training performance. Moreover, this improvement seamlessly carries over to supervised fine-tuning. All these gains can be attributed to the fact that LayerNorm Scaling enables deeper layers to contribute more effectively during training.

We present an end-to-end workflow for grading scanned handwritten engineering quizzes with multimodal large language models (LLMs) that preserves the standard exam process (A4 paper, unconstrained student handwriting). The lecturer provides only a handwritten reference solution (100%) and a short set of grading rules; the reference is converted into a text-only summary that conditions grading without exposing the reference scan. Reliability is achieved through a multi-stage design with a format/presence check to prevent grading blank answers, an ensemble of independent graders, supervisor aggregation, and rigid templates with deterministic validation to produce auditable, machine-parseable reports. We evaluate the frozen pipeline in a clean-room protocol on a held-out real course quiz in Slovenian, including hand-drawn circuit schematics. With state-of-the-art backends (GPT-5.2 and Gemini-3 Pro), the full pipeline achieves $\approx$8-point mean absolute difference to lecturer grades with low bias and an estimated manual-review trigger rate of $\approx$17% at $D_{\max}=40$. Ablations show that trivial prompting and removing the reference solution substantially degrade accuracy and introduce systematic over-grading, confirming that structured prompting and reference grounding are essential.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

| **[A Vision-and-Knowledge Enhanced Large Language Model for Generalizable Pedestrian Crossing Behavior Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00694v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing paradigms for inferring pedestrian crossing behavior, ranging from statistical models to supervised learning methods, demonstrate limited generalizability and perform inadequately on new sites. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a shift from numerical pattern fitting to semantic, context-aware behavioral reasoning, yet existing LLM applications lack domain-specific adaptation and visual context. This study introduces Pedestrian Crossing LLM (PedX-LLM), a vision-and-knowledge enhanced framework designed to transform pedestrian crossing inference from site-specific pattern recognition to generalizable behavioral reasoning. By integrating LLaVA-extracted visual features with textual data and transportation domain knowledge, PedX-LLM fine-tunes a LLaMA-2-7B foundation model via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to infer crossing decisions. PedX-LLM achieves 82.0% balanced accuracy, outperforming the best statistical and supervised learning methods. Results demonstrate that the vision-augmented module contributes a 2.9% performance gain by capturing the built environment and integrating domain knowledge yields an additional 4.1% improvement. To evaluate generalizability across unseen environments, cross-site validation was conducted using site-based partitioning. The zero-shot PedX-LLM configuration achieves 66.9% balanced accuracy on five unseen test sites, outperforming the baseline data-driven methods by at least 18 percentage points. Incorporating just five validation examples via few-shot learning to PedX-LLM further elevates the balanced accuracy to 72.2%. PedX-LLM demonstrates strong generalizability to unseen scenarios, confirming that vision-and-knowledge-enhanced reasoning enables the model to mimic human-like decision logic and overcome the limitations of purely data-driven methods.</p></details> |  |

However, this raises concerns about sensitive data leakage. Prior methods, relying on differential privacy within device-cloud collaboration frameworks, struggle to balance privacy and utility, exposing users to inference attacks or degrading fine-tuning performance. To address this, we propose PrivTune, an efficient and privacy-preserving fine-tuning framework via Split Learning (SL). The key idea of PrivTune is to inject crafted noise into token representations from the SL bottom model, making each token resemble the $n$-hop indirect neighbors. PrivTune formulates this as an optimization problem to compute the optimal noise vector, aligning with defense-utility goals. On this basis, it then adjusts the parameters (i.e., mean) of the $d_χ$-Privacy noise distribution to align with the optimization direction and scales the noise according to token importance to minimize distortion. Experiments on five datasets (covering both classification and generation tasks) against three embedding inversion and three attribute inference attacks show that, using RoBERTa on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset, PrivTune reduces the attack success rate to 10% with only a 3.33% drop in utility performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE INFOCOM 2026 (full version)</p></details> |

This study presents the first ecosystem-scale longitudinal analysis of software bugs across 123 open source quantum repositories from 2012 to 2024, spanning eight functional categories, including full-stack libraries, simulators, annealing, algorithms, compilers, assembly, cryptography, and experimental computing. Using a mixed method approach combining repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and a validated rule-based classification framework, we analyze 32,296 verified bug reports. Results show that full-stack libraries and compilers are the most bug-prone categories due to circuit, gate, and transpilation-related issues, while simulators are mainly affected by measurement and noise modeling errors. Classical bugs primarily impact usability and interoperability, whereas quantum-specific bugs disproportionately degrade performance, maintainability, and reliability. Longitudinal analysis indicates ecosystem maturation, with bug densities peaking between 2017 and 2021 and declining thereafter. High-severity bugs cluster in cryptography, experimental computing, and compiler toolchains. Repositories employing automated testing detect more bugs and resolve issues faster. A negative binomial regression further shows that automated testing is associated with an approximate 60 percent reduction in expected bug incidence. Overall, this work provides the first large-scale data-driven characterization of quantum software bugs and offers empirical guidance for improving testing, documentation, and maintainability practices in QSE.</p></details> |  |

Existing alignment approaches such as Direct Preference Optimization are limited in this setting, as they model preferences as binary labels and ignore the continuous structure of the physical energy landscape. We propose Physio-DPO, a physics informed alignment framework that grounds protein language models in thermodynamic stability. Physio-DPO introduces a magnitude aware objective that scales optimization updates according to the energy gap between native structures and physics perturbed hard negatives. Experiments show that Physio-DPO consistently outperforms strong baselines including SFT, PPO, and standard DPO, reducing self consistency RMSD to 1.28 Å and increasing foldability to 92.8%. Qualitative analysis further demonstrates that Physio-DPO effectively mitigates structural hallucinations by recovering biophysical interactions such as hydrophobic core packing and hydrogen bond networks.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a comprehensive navigation and control framework for an LSMR that ensures stability and safety-defined performance, delivering robust operation on slip-prone terrain by jointly leveraging high-performance techniques. The proposed architecture comprises four main modules: (1) a visual pose-estimation module that fuses onboard sensors and stereo cameras to provide an accurate, low-latency robot pose, (2) a high-level nonlinear model predictive control that updates the wheel motion commands to correct robot drift from the robot reference pose on slip-prone terrain, (3) a low-level deep neural network control policy that approximates the complex behavior of the wheel-driven actuation mechanism in LSMRs, augmented with robust adaptive control to handle out-of-distribution disturbances, ensuring that the wheels accurately track the updated commands issued by high-level control module, and (4) a logarithmic safety module to monitor the entire robot stack and guarantees safe operation. The proposed low-level control framework guarantees uniform exponential stability of the actuation subsystem, while the safety module ensures the whole system-level safety during operation.

Then, we discuss how these techniques can be implemented within the federated learning framework. Moreover, we conduct experiments on federated prefix-tuning, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first trial to apply prefix-tuning in the federated learning setting. The conducted experiments validate its feasibility with performance close to centralized approaches. Further comparison with three other federated customization methods demonstrated its competitive performance, satisfactory efficiency, and consistent robustness.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |

However, these systems are prone to inaccurate, fictitious, or harmful responses, and their vast, high-dimensional input space makes systematic testing particularly challenging. To address this, we present STELLAR, an automated search-based testing framework for LLM-based applications that systematically uncovers text inputs leading to inappropriate system responses. Our framework models test generation as an optimization problem and discretizes the input space into stylistic, content-related, and perturbation features. Unlike prior work that focuses on prompt optimization or coverage heuristics, our work employs evolutionary optimization to dynamically explore feature combinations that are more likely to expose failures. We evaluate STELLAR on three LLM-based conversational question-answering systems. The first focuses on safety, benchmarking both public and proprietary LLMs against malicious or unsafe prompts. The second and third target navigation, using an open-source and an industrial retrieval-augmented system for in-vehicle venue recommendations. Overall, STELLAR exposes up to 4.3 times (average 2.5 times) more failures than the existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 33th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER 2026)</p></details> |
| **[The Role of Mixed-Language Documents for Multilingual Large Language Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00364v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual large language models achieve impressive cross-lingual performance despite largely monolingual pretraining. While bilingual data in pretraining corpora is widely believed to enable these abilities, details of its contributions remain unclear. We investigate this question by pretraining models from scratch under controlled conditions, comparing the standard web corpus with a monolingual-only version that removes all multilingual documents. Despite constituting only 2% of the corpus, removing bilingual data causes translation performance to drop 56% in BLEU, while behaviour on cross-lingual QA and general reasoning tasks remains stable, with training curves largely overlapping the baseline. To understand this asymmetry, we categorize bilingual data into parallel (14%), code-switching (72%), and miscellaneous documents (14%) based on the semantic relevance of content in different languages. We then conduct granular ablations by reintroducing parallel or code-switching data into the monolingual-only corpus. Our experiments reveal that parallel data almost fully restores translation performance (91% of the unfiltered baseline), whereas code-switching contributes minimally. Other cross-lingual tasks remain largely unaffected by either type. These findings reveal that translation critically depends on systematic token-level alignments from parallel data, whereas cross-lingual understanding and reasoning appear to be achievable even without bilingual data.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Robust Uncertainty Quantification for Factual Generation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00348v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language model(LLM) technology has facilitated its integration into various domains of professional and daily life. However, the persistent challenge of LLM hallucination has emerged as a critical limitation, significantly compromising the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content. This challenge has garnered significant attention within the scientific community, prompting extensive research efforts in hallucination detection and mitigation strategies. Current methodological frameworks reveal a critical limitation: traditional uncertainty quantification approaches demonstrate effectiveness primarily within conventional question-answering paradigms, yet exhibit notable deficiencies when confronted with non-canonical or adversarial questioning strategies. This performance gap raises substantial concerns regarding the dependability of LLM responses in real-world applications requiring robust critical thinking capabilities. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing an uncertainty quantification scenario in the task of generating with multiple facts. We have meticulously constructed a set of trap questions contained with fake names. Based on this scenario, we innovatively propose a novel and robust uncertainty quantification method(RU). A series of experiments have been conducted to verify its effectiveness. The results show that the constructed set of trap questions performs excellently. Moreover, when compared with the baseline methods on four different models, our proposed method has demonstrated great performance, with an average increase of 0.1-0.2 in ROCAUC values compared to the best performing baseline method, providing new sights and methods for addressing the hallucination issue of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 tables, 5 figures, accepted to IJCNN 2025</p></details> |
| **[TabiBERT: A Large-Scale ModernBERT Foundation Model and Unified Benchmarking Framework for Turkish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23065v2)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the inception of BERT, encoder-only Transformers have evolved significantly in computational efficiency, training stability, and long-context modeling. ModernBERT consolidates these advances by integrating Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), FlashAttention, and refined normalization. Despite these developments, Turkish NLP lacks a monolingual encoder trained from scratch, incorporating such modern architectural paradigms. This work introduces TabiBERT, a monolingual Turkish encoder based on ModernBERT architecture trained from scratch on a large, curated corpus. TabiBERT is pre-trained on one trillion tokens sampled from an 84.88B token multi-domain corpus: web text (73%), scientific publications (20%), source code (6%), and mathematical content (0.3%). It supports 8,192-token context length (16x original BERT), achieves up to 2.65x inference speedup, and reduces GPU memory consumption, enabling larger batch sizes. We introduce TabiBench with 28 datasets across eight task categories with standardized splits and protocols, evaluated using GLUE-style macro-averaging. TabiBERT attains 77.58 on TabiBench, outperforming BERTurk by 1.62 points and establishing state-of-the-art on five of eight categories, with particularly strong gains on question answering (+9.55 points), code retrieval (+2.41 points), and academic understanding (+0.66 points). Compared with task-specific prior best results, including specialized models like TurkishBERTweet, TabiBERT achieves +1.47 average improvement, indicating robust cross-domain generalization. We release model weights, training configurations, and evaluation code for transparent, reproducible Turkish encoder research.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 2 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on the Application of Large Language Models in Scenario-Based Testing of Automated Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16587v2)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety and reliability of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs) must be validated prior to large-scale deployment. Among existing validation approaches, scenario-based testing has been regarded as a promising method to improve testing efficiency and reduce associated costs. Recently, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced new opportunities to reinforce this approach. While an increasing number of studies have explored the use of LLMs in the field of automated driving, a dedicated review focusing on their application within scenario-based testing remains absent. This survey addresses this gap by systematically categorizing the roles played by LLMs across various phased of scenario-based testing, drawing from both academic research and industrial practice. In addition, key characteristics of LLMs and corresponding usage strategies are comprehensively summarized. The paper concludes by outlining five open challenges and potential research directions. To support ongoing research efforts, a continuously updated repository of recent advancements and relevant open-source tools is made available at: https://github.com/ftgTUGraz/LLM4ADSTest.</p></details> | 24 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Red Teaming Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00412v2)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have emerged as a powerful advancement in multi-step reasoning tasks, offering enhanced transparency and logical consistency through explicit chains of thought (CoT). However, these models introduce novel safety and reliability risks, such as CoT-hijacking and prompt-induced inefficiencies, which are not fully captured by existing evaluation methods. To address this gap, we propose RT-LRM, a unified benchmark designed to assess the trustworthiness of LRMs. RT-LRM evaluates three core dimensions: truthfulness, safety and efficiency. Beyond metric-based evaluation, we further introduce the training paradigm as a key analytical perspective to investigate the systematic impact of different training strategies on model trustworthiness. We achieve this by designing a curated suite of 30 reasoning tasks from an observational standpoint. We conduct extensive experiments on 26 models and identify several valuable insights into the trustworthiness of LRMs. For example, LRMs generally face trustworthiness challenges and tend to be more fragile than Large Language Models (LLMs) when encountering reasoning-induced risks. These findings uncover previously underexplored vulnerabilities and highlight the need for more targeted evaluations. In addition, we release a scalable toolbox for standardized trustworthiness research to support future advancements in this important field. Our code and datasets will be open-sourced.</p></details> | 30 pages, 9 figures |

The goal is to find Sidon sets of large size. In this note we show that the graphs of almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions with high linearity can be used to construct large Sidon sets. Thanks to recently constructed APN functions $\mathbb{F}_2^8\to \mathbb{F}_2^8$ with high linearity, we can construct Sidon sets of size 192 in $\mathbb{F}_2^{15}$, where the largest sets so far had size 152. Using the inverse and the Dobbertin function also gives larger Sidon sets as previously known. Each of the new large Sidon sets $M$ in $\mathbb{F}_2^t$ yields a binary linear code with $t$ check bits, minimum distance 5, and a length not known so far. Moreover, we improve the upper bound for the linearity of arbitrary APN functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; revised manuscript identical to accepted one</p></details> |

The estimator is motivated by difficulties with the computation of existing spectral density estimators for time series of functions defined on very large grids that arise, for example, in climate compute models and medical scans. Existing estimators use autocovariance kernels represented as large $G \times G$ matrices, where $G$ is the number of grid points on which the functions are evaluated. In many recent applications, functions are defined on 2D and 3D domains, and $G$ can be of the order $G \sim 10^5$, making the evaluation of the autocovariance kernels computationally intensive or even impossible. We use the theory of spectral functional principal components to derive our deep learning estimator and prove that it is a universal approximator to the spectral density under general assumptions. Our estimator can be trained without computing the autocovariance kernels and it can be parallelized to provide the estimates much faster than existing approaches. We validate its performance by simulations and an application to fMRI images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Still Explain Themselves? Investigating the Impact of Quantization on Self-Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00282v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization is widely used to accelerate inference and streamline the deployment of large language models (LLMs), yet its effects on self-explanations (SEs) remain unexplored. SEs, generated by LLMs to justify their own outputs, require reasoning about the model's own decision-making process, a capability that may exhibit particular sensitivity to quantization. As SEs are increasingly relied upon for transparency in high-stakes applications, understanding whether and to what extent quantization degrades SE quality and faithfulness is critical. To address this gap, we examine two types of SEs: natural language explanations (NLEs) and counterfactual examples, generated by LLMs quantized using three common techniques at distinct bit widths. Our findings indicate that quantization typically leads to moderate declines in both SE quality (up to 4.4\%) and faithfulness (up to 2.38\%). The user study further demonstrates that quantization diminishes both the coherence and trustworthiness of SEs (up to 8.5\%). Compared to smaller models, larger models show limited resilience to quantization in terms of SE quality but better maintain faithfulness. Moreover, no quantization technique consistently excels across task accuracy, SE quality, and faithfulness. Given that quantization's impact varies by context, we recommend validating SE quality for specific use cases, especially for NLEs, which show greater sensitivity. Nonetheless, the relatively minor deterioration in SE quality and faithfulness does not undermine quantization's effectiveness as a model compression technique.</p></details> | In submission |

We present S1-MMAlign, a large-scale, multi-disciplinary multimodal dataset comprising over 15.5 million high-quality image-text pairs derived from 2.5 million open-access scientific papers. Spanning disciplines from physics and biology to engineering, the dataset captures diverse visual modalities including experimental setups, heatmaps, and microscopic imagery. To address the pervasive issue of weak alignment in raw scientific captions, we introduce an AI-ready semantic enhancement pipeline that utilizes the Qwen-VL multimodal large model series to recaption images by synthesizing context from paper abstracts and citation contexts. Technical validation demonstrates that this enhancement significantly improves data quality: SciBERT-based pseudo-perplexity metrics show reduced semantic ambiguity, while CLIP scores indicate an 18.21% improvement in image-text alignment.

Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a promising technique to reduce memory requirements and decoding latency. However, recent accurate quantization methods often depend on specialized computations or custom data formats to achieve better model quality, which limits their compatibility with popular frameworks, as they require dedicated inference kernels tailored to specific hardware and software platforms, hindering wider adoption. Furthermore, many competitive methods have high resource requirements and computational overhead for quantizing models, making it challenging to scale them to hundreds of billions of parameters. In response to these challenges, we propose LeanQuant (Loss-Error-Aware Network Quantization), a novel quantization method that is accurate, versatile, and scalable. In the existing popular iterative loss-error-based quantization framework, we identify a critical limitation in prior methods: the min-max affine quantization grid fails to preserve model quality due to outliers in inverse Hessian diagonals. To overcome this fundamental issue, we propose learning loss-error-aware grids, instead of using non-adaptive min-max affine grids. Our approach not only produces quantized models that are more accurate but also generalizes to a wider range of quantization types, including affine and non-uniform quantization, enhancing compatibility with more frameworks. Extensive experiments with recent LLMs demonstrate that LeanQuant is highly accurate, comparing favorably against competitive baselines in model quality, and scalable, achieving very accurate quantization of Llama-3.1 405B, one of the largest open-source LLMs to date, using two Quadro RTX 8000-48GB GPUs in 21 hours.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICLR 2025</p></details> |

While existing ultra-low-bit methods rely on binary approximations or quantization-aware training(QAT), they often suffer from either limited representational capacity or huge training resource overhead. We introduce PTQ to Trit-Planes (PTQTP), a structured PTQ framework that decomposes weight matrices into dual ternary {-1, 0, 1} trit-planes. This approach achieves multiplication-free additive inference by decoupling weights into discrete topology (trit-planes) and continuous magnitude (scales), effectively enabling high-fidelity sparse approximation. PTQTP provides: (1) a theoretically grounded progressive approximation algorithm ensuring global weight consistency; (2) model-agnostic deployment without architectural modifications; and (3) uniform ternary operations that eliminate mixed-precision overhead. Comprehensive experiments on LLaMA3.x and Qwen3 (0.6B-70B) demonstrate that PTQTP significantly outperforms sub-4bit PTQ methods on both language reasoning tasks and mathematical reasoning as well as coding. PTQTP rivals the 1.58-bit QAT performance while requiring only single-hour quantization compared to 10-14 GPU days for training-based methods, and the end-to-end inference speed achieves 4.63$\times$ faster than the FP16 baseline model, establishing a new and practical solution for efficient LLM deployment in resource-constrained environments.

This is primarily because collecting large volumes of diverse target samples from SAR images is prohibitively expensive, largely due to privacy concerns, the characteristics of microwave radar imagery perception, and the need for specialized expertise in data annotation. Throughout the history of SAR ATR research, there have been only a number of small datasets, mainly including targets like ships, airplanes, buildings, etc. There is only one vehicle dataset MSTAR collected in the 1990s, which has been a valuable source for SAR ATR. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a large-scale, new dataset named ATRNet-STAR with 40 different vehicle categories collected under various realistic imaging conditions and scenes. It marks a substantial advancement in dataset scale and diversity, comprising over 190,000 well-annotated samples, 10 times larger than its predecessor, the famous MSTAR. Building such a large dataset is a challenging task, and the data collection scheme will be detailed. Secondly, we illustrate the value of ATRNet-STAR via extensively evaluating the performance of 15 representative methods with 7 different experimental settings on challenging classification and detection benchmarks derived from the dataset. Finally, based on our extensive experiments, we identify valuable insights for SAR ATR and discuss potential future research directions in this field. We hope that the scale, diversity, and benchmark of ATRNet-STAR can significantly facilitate the advancement of SAR ATR.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 12 figures; Homepage: https://github.com/waterdisappear/ATRNet-STAR</p></details> |

Training-time alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) face prohibitive costs in expert supervision and inherent scalability limitations, offering limited dynamic control during inference. Consequently, there is an urgent need for scalable and adaptable alignment mechanisms. To address this, we propose W2S-AlignTree, a pioneering plug-and-play inference-time alignment framework that synergistically combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with the Weak-to-Strong Generalization paradigm for the first time. W2S-AlignTree formulates LLM alignment as an optimal heuristic search problem within a generative search tree. By leveraging weak model's real-time, step-level signals as alignment proxies and introducing an Entropy-Aware exploration mechanism, W2S-AlignTree enables fine-grained guidance during strong model's generation without modifying its parameters. The approach dynamically balances exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional generation search trees. Experiments across controlled sentiment generation, summarization, and instruction-following show that W2S-AlignTree consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, W2S-AlignTree raises the performance of Llama3-8B from 1.89 to 2.19, a relative improvement of 15.9 on the summarization task.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 Oral |

Despite recent progress, existing TKG reasoning models typically rely on large parameter sizes and intensive computation, leading to high hardware costs and energy consumption. These constraints hinder their deployment on resource-constrained, low-power, and distributed platforms that require real-time inference. Moreover, most existing model compression and distillation techniques are designed for static knowledge graphs and fail to adequately capture the temporal dependencies inherent in TKGs, often resulting in degraded reasoning performance. To address these challenges, we propose a distillation framework specifically tailored for temporal knowledge graph reasoning. Our approach leverages large language models as teacher models to guide the distillation process, enabling effective transfer of both structural and temporal reasoning capabilities to lightweight student models. By integrating large-scale public knowledge with task-specific temporal information, the proposed framework enhances the student model's ability to model temporal dynamics while maintaining a compact and efficient architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving a favorable trade-off between reasoning accuracy, computational efficiency, and practical deployability.</p></details> |  |

However, limited work exists on studying the trustworthiness of DriveVLMs -- a critical factor that directly impacts public transportation safety. In this paper, we introduce AutoTrust, a comprehensive trustworthiness benchmark for large vision-language models in autonomous driving (DriveVLMs), considering diverse perspectives -- including trustfulness, safety, robustness, privacy, and fairness. We constructed the largest visual question-answering dataset for investigating trustworthiness issues in driving scenarios, comprising over 10k unique scenes and 18k queries. We evaluated six publicly available VLMs, spanning from generalist to specialist, from open-source to commercial models. Our exhaustive evaluations have unveiled previously undiscovered vulnerabilities of DriveVLMs to trustworthiness threats. Specifically, we found that the general VLMs like LLaVA-v1.6 and GPT-4o-mini surprisingly outperform specialized models fine-tuned for driving in terms of overall trustworthiness. DriveVLMs like DriveLM-Agent are particularly vulnerable to disclosing sensitive information. Additionally, both generalist and specialist VLMs remain susceptible to adversarial attacks and struggle to ensure unbiased decision-making across diverse environments and populations. Our findings call for immediate and decisive action to address the trustworthiness of DriveVLMs -- an issue of critical importance to public safety and the welfare of all citizens relying on autonomous transportation systems.

| **[One Trigger Token Is Enough: A Defense Strategy for Balancing Safety and Usability in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07167v3)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively used across diverse domains, including virtual assistants, automated code generation, and scientific research. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which manipulate the models into generating harmful responses despite safety alignment. Recent studies have shown that current safety-aligned LLMs undergo shallow safety alignment. In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation into the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and reveal that it manifests through learned ''safety trigger tokens'' that activate the model's safety patterns when paired with the specific input. Through both analysis and empirical verification, we further demonstrate the high similarity of the safety trigger tokens across different harmful inputs. Accordingly, we propose D-STT, a simple yet effective defense algorithm that identifies and explicitly decodes safety trigger tokens of the given safety-aligned LLM to activate the model's learned safety patterns. In this process, the safety trigger is constrained to a single token, which effectively preserves model usability by introducing minimum intervention in the decoding process. Extensive experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks and benign prompts demonstrate that D-STT significantly reduces output harmfulness while preserving model usability and incurring negligible response time overhead, outperforming ten baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MetaJuLS, a meta-reinforcement learning approach that learns universal constraint propagation policies applicable across languages and tasks without task-specific retraining. By formulating structured inference as adaptive constraint propagation and training a Graph Attention Network with meta-learning, MetaJuLS achieves 1.5--2.0$\times$ speedups over GPU-optimized baselines while maintaining within 0.2\% accuracy of state-of-the-art parsers. On Universal Dependencies across 10 languages and LLM-constrained generation (LogicBench, GSM8K-Constrained), MetaJuLS demonstrates rapid cross-domain adaptation: a policy trained on English parsing adapts to new languages and tasks with 5--10 gradient steps (5--15 seconds) rather than requiring hours of task-specific training. Mechanistic analysis reveals the policy discovers human-like parsing strategies (easy-first) and novel non-intuitive heuristics. By reducing propagation steps in LLM deployments, MetaJuLS contributes to Green AI by directly reducing inference carbon footprint.</p></details> |  |

The conditional entropy or code length in many cases continues to decrease with context length at least to $N\sim 10^4$ characters, implying that there are direct dependencies or interactions across these distances. A corollary is that there are small but significant correlations between characters at these separations, as we show from the data independent of models. The distribution of code lengths reveals an emergent certainty about an increasing fraction of characters at large $N$. Over the course of model training, we observe different dynamics at long and short context lengths, suggesting that long-ranged structure is learned only gradually. Our results constrain efforts to build statistical physics models of LLMs or language itself.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Through a comprehensive analysis of 117 studies across 96 LR languages, we identify key patterns in how researchers tackle the challenges of limited data and computational resources. We categorize works into resource-oriented and method-oriented contributions, further dividing contributions into relevant sub-categories. We compare method-oriented contributions in terms of performance and efficiency, discussing benefits and limitations of representative studies. We find that visual information often serves as a crucial bridge for improving model performance in LR settings, though significant challenges remain in areas such as hallucination mitigation and computational efficiency. In summary, we provide researchers with a clear understanding of current approaches and remaining challenges in making LMMs more accessible to speakers of LR (understudied) languages.

| **[Towards autonomous time-calibration of large quantum-dot devices: Detection, real-time feedback, and noise spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24894v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance and scalability of semiconductor quantum-dot (QD) qubits are limited by electrostatic drift and charge noise that shift operating points and destabilize qubit parameters. As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array. From our analysis, we find that the background noise at 100~$μ$\si{\hertz} is dominated by drift with a power law of $1/f^2$, accompanied by a few dominant two-level fluctuators and an average linear correlation length of $(188 \pm 38)$~\si{\nano\meter} in the device. These capabilities form the basis of a scalable, autonomous calibration and characterization module for QD-based quantum processors, providing essential feedback for long-duration, high-fidelity qubit operations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

However, current literature often overlooks the significant computational burden associated with generating long reasoning sequences. For industrial applications, model selection depends not only on raw accuracy but also on resource constraints and inference costs. In this work, we conduct a test-time-compute aware evaluation of both contemporary and older open-source LLMs, mapping their Pareto frontiers across math- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Our findings identify the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture as a strong candidate to balance performance and efficiency in our evaluation setting. Furthermore, we trace the trajectory of Pareto efficiency over time to derive an emergent trend regarding accuracy gain per unit of compute. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a saturation point for inference-time compute. Beyond a certain threshold, accuracy gains diminish, indicating that while extended reasoning capabilities are beneficial, they cannot overcome intrinsic model limitations regarding specific complexities.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of QA datasets in specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce MedQARo, the first large-scale medical QA benchmark in Romanian, alongside a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). We construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 105,880 QA pairs related to cancer patients from two medical centers. The questions regard medical case summaries of 1,242 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered correctly. MedQARo is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who spent a total of about 3,000 work hours to generate the QA pairs. Our benchmark contains both in-domain and cross-domain (cross-center and cross-cancer) test collections, enabling a precise assessment of generalization capabilities. We experiment with four open-source LLMs from distinct families of models on MedQARo. Each model is employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one based on supervised fine-tuning. We also evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs exposed only through APIs, namely GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Flash. Our results show that fine-tuned models significantly outperform zero-shot models, clearly indicating that pretrained models fail to generalize on MedQARo. Our findings demonstrate the importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at https://github.com/ana-rogoz/MedQARo.</p></details> |  |

Traditional navigation methods focus on optimal trajectory generation within fixed free workspace, therefore struggling in environments lacking viable paths to the goal, such as disaster zones or cluttered warehouses. To address this problem, we propose AINav, an adaptive interactive navigation approach that proactively interacts with environments to create feasible paths to achieve originally unreachable goals. Specifically, we present a primitive skill tree for task planning with large language models (LLMs), facilitating effective reasoning to determine interaction objects and sequences. To ensure robust subtask execution, we adopt reinforcement learning to pre-train a comprehensive skill library containing versatile locomotion and interaction behaviors for motion planning. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive replanning approach featuring two LLM-based modules: an advisor serving as a flexible replanning trigger and an arborist for autonomous plan adjustment. Integrated with the tree structure, the replanning mechanism allows for convenient node addition and pruning, enabling rapid plan adaptation in a priori unknown environments. Comprehensive simulations and experiments have demonstrated AINav's effectiveness and adaptivity in diverse scenarios.

However, a growing concern lies in their tendency to produce excessively long reasoning traces, which are often filled with redundant content (e.g., repeated definitions), over-analysis of simple problems, and superficial exploration of multiple reasoning paths for harder tasks. This inefficiency introduces significant challenges for training, inference, and real-world deployment (e.g., in agent-based systems), where token economy is critical. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent efforts aimed at improving reasoning efficiency in LRMs, with a particular focus on the unique challenges that arise in this new paradigm. We identify common patterns of inefficiency, examine methods proposed across the LRM lifecycle, i.e., from pretraining to inference, and discuss promising future directions for research. To support ongoing development, we also maintain a real-time GitHub repository tracking recent progress in the field. We hope this survey serves as a foundation for further exploration and inspires innovation in this rapidly evolving area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update recent RL papers.

| **[TrimTokenator-LC: Towards Adaptive Visual Token Pruning for Large Multimodal Models with Long Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22748v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have proven effective on various tasks. They typically encode visual inputs into Original Model sequences of tokens, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly processed by the language model. However, the growing number of visual tokens greatly increases inference cost. Visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods often overlook scenarios involving long context inputs with multiple images. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of visual token pruning in long context, multi-image settings and introduce an adaptive pruning method tailored for such scenarios. We decompose redundancy into intra-image and inter-image components and quantify them through intra-image diversity and inter-image variation, which jointly guide dynamic budget allocation. Our approach consists of two stages. The intra-image stage allocates each image a content-aware token budget and greedily selects its most representative tokens. The inter-image stage performs global diversity filtering to form a candidate pool and then applies a Pareto selection procedure that balances diversity with text alignment. Extensive experiments show that our approach can reduce up to 80% of visual tokens while maintaining performance in long context settings.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Large Language Model Sourcing: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10161v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the black-box nature of large language models (LLMs) and the realism of their generated content, issues such as hallucinations, bias, unfairness, and copyright infringement have become significant. In this context, sourcing information from multiple perspectives is essential. This survey presents a systematic investigation organized around four interrelated dimensions: Model Sourcing, Model Structure Sourcing, Training Data Sourcing, and External Data Sourcing. Moreover, a unified dual-paradigm taxonomy is proposed that classifies existing sourcing methods into prior-based (proactive traceability embedding) and posterior-based (retrospective inference) approaches. Traceability across these dimensions enhances the transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of LLMs deployment in real-world applications.</p></details> | 31 pages |
| **[Do Large Language Models Know What They Are Capable Of?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24661v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can predict whether they will succeed on a given task and whether their predictions improve as they progress through multi-step tasks. We also investigate whether LLMs can learn from in-context experiences to make better decisions about whether to pursue a task in scenarios where failure is costly. All LLMs we tested are overconfident, but most predict their success with better-than-random discriminatory power. We find that newer and larger LLMs generally do not have greater discriminatory power, though Claude models do show such a trend. On multi-step agentic tasks, the overconfidence of several frontier LLMs worsens as they progress through the tasks, and reasoning LLMs perform comparably to or worse than non-reasoning LLMs. With in-context experiences of failure, some but not all LLMs reduce their overconfidence leading to significantly improved decision making, while others do not. Interestingly, all LLMs' decisions are approximately rational given their estimated probabilities of success, yet their overly-optimistic estimates result in poor decision making. These results suggest that current LLM agents are hindered by their lack of awareness of their own capabilities. We discuss the implications of LLMs' awareness of their capabilities for AI misuse and misalignment risks.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Dynamic Strategy Adaptation in Multi-Agent Environments with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02002v4)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities across mathematical, strategic, and linguistic tasks, yet little is known about how well they reason in dynamic, real-time, multi-agent scenarios, such as collaborative environments in which agents continuously adapt to each other's behavior, as in cooperative gameplay settings. In this paper, we bridge this gap by combining LLM-driven agents with strategic reasoning and real-time adaptation in cooperative, multi-agent environments grounded in game-theoretic principles such as belief consistency and Nash equilibrium. The proposed framework applies broadly to dynamic scenarios in which agents coordinate, communicate, and make decisions in response to continuously changing conditions. We provide real-time strategy refinement and adaptive feedback mechanisms that enable agents to dynamically adjust policies based on immediate contextual interactions, in contrast to previous efforts that evaluate LLM capabilities in static or turn-based settings. Empirical results show that our method achieves up to a 26\% improvement in return over PPO baselines in high-noise environments, while maintaining real-time latency under 1.05 milliseconds. Our approach improves collaboration efficiency, task completion rates, and flexibility, illustrating that game-theoretic guidance integrated with real-time feedback enhances LLM performance, ultimately fostering more resilient and flexible strategic multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Large Concept Models: Latent Reasoning in an Adaptive Semantic Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24617v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) apply uniform computation to all tokens, despite language exhibiting highly non-uniform information density. This token-uniform regime wastes capacity on locally predictable spans while under-allocating computation to semantically critical transitions. We propose $\textbf{Dynamic Large Concept Models (DLCM)}$, a hierarchical language modeling framework that learns semantic boundaries from latent representations and shifts computation from tokens to a compressed concept space where reasoning is more efficient. DLCM discovers variable-length concepts end-to-end without relying on predefined linguistic units. Hierarchical compression fundamentally changes scaling behavior. We introduce the first $\textbf{compression-aware scaling law}$, which disentangles token-level capacity, concept-level reasoning capacity, and compression ratio, enabling principled compute allocation under fixed FLOPs. To stably train this heterogeneous architecture, we further develop a $\textbf{decoupled $μ$P parametrization}$ that supports zero-shot hyperparameter transfer across widths and compression regimes. At a practical setting ($R=4$, corresponding to an average of four tokens per concept), DLCM reallocates roughly one-third of inference compute into a higher-capacity reasoning backbone, achieving a $\textbf{+2.69$\%$ average improvement}$ across 12 zero-shot benchmarks under matched inference FLOPs.</p></details> |  |

It is very critical for roadside infrastructure system to interpret natural languages and localize relevant target objects in complex traffic environments. However, most existing datasets and approaches for 3D visual grounding focus on the indoor and outdoor driving scenes, outdoor monitoring scenarios remain unexplored due to scarcity of paired point cloud-text data captured by roadside infrastructure sensors. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of 3D Visual Grounding for Outdoor Monitoring Scenarios, which enables infrastructure-level understanding of traffic scenes beyond the ego-vehicle perspective. To support this task, we construct MoniRefer, the first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside-level 3D visual grounding. The dataset consists of about 136,018 objects with 411,128 natural language expressions collected from multiple complex traffic intersections in the real-world environments. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset, we manually verified all linguistic descriptions and 3D labels for objects. Additionally, we also propose a new end-to-end method, named Moni3DVG, which utilizes the rich appearance information provided by images and geometry and optical information from point cloud for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. Our dataset and code will be released.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Through contrastive learning and multi-task optimization, ALF creates unified advertiser representations that capture both content and behavioral patterns. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on critical tasks including fraud detection, policy violation identification, and advertiser similarity matching. In production deployment, ALF demonstrates significant real-world impact by delivering simultaneous gains in both precision and recall, for instance boosting recall by over 40 percentage points on one critical policy and increasing precision to 99.8% on another. The architecture's effectiveness stems from its novel combination of multi-modal transformations, inter-sample attention mechanism, spectrally normalized projections, and calibrated probabilistic outputs.</p></details> | KDD 2026 ADS Track |

Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to long-context reasoning limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex, interprocedural specifications. This paper presents Preguss -- a modular, fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive verification by steering two components in a divide-and-conquer fashion: (i) potential runtime error-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii) LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We show that Preguss substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches and, in particular, it enables highly automated RTE-freeness verification for real-world programs with over a thousand LoC, with a reduction of 80.6%~88.9% human verification effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at OOPSLA 2026</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Model-Driven Closed-Loop UAV Operation with Semantic Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01930v5)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized mobile robots, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), enabling their intelligent operation within Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. However, LLMs still face challenges from logical reasoning and complex decision-making, leading to concerns about the reliability of LLM-driven UAV operations in IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop LLM-driven UAV operation code generation framework that enables reliable UAV operations powered by effective feedback and refinement using two LLM modules, i.e., a Code Generator and an Evaluator. Our framework transforms numerical state observations from UAV operations into semantic trajectory descriptions to enhance the evaluator LLM's understanding of UAV dynamics for precise feedback generation. Our framework also enables a simulation-based refinement process, and hence eliminates the risks to physical UAVs caused by incorrect code execution during the refinement. Extensive experiments on UAV control tasks with different complexities are conducted. The experimental results show that our framework can achieve reliable UAV operations using LLMs, which significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of success rate and completeness with the increase of task complexity.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |
| **[SynRAG: A Large Language Model Framework for Executable Query Generation in Heterogeneous SIEM System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24571v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are essential for large enterprises to monitor their IT infrastructure by ingesting and analyzing millions of logs and events daily. Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts are tasked with monitoring and analyzing this vast data to identify potential threats and take preventive actions to protect enterprise assets. However, the diversity among SIEM platforms, such as Palo Alto Networks Qradar, Google SecOps, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel and the Elastic Stack, poses significant challenges. As these systems differ in attributes, architecture, and query languages, making it difficult for analysts to effectively monitor multiple platforms without undergoing extensive training or forcing enterprises to expand their workforce. To address this issue, we introduce SynRAG, a unified framework that automatically generates threat detection or incident investigation queries for multiple SIEM platforms from a platform-agnostic specification. SynRAG can generate platformspecific queries from a single high-level specification written by analysts. Without SynRAG, analysts would need to manually write separate queries for each SIEM platform, since query languages vary significantly across systems. This framework enables seamless threat detection and incident investigation across heterogeneous SIEM environments, reducing the need for specialized training and manual query translation. We evaluate SynRAG against state-of-the-art language models, including GPT, Llama, DeepSeek, Gemma, and Claude, using Qradar and SecOps as representative SIEM systems. Our results demonstrate that SynRAG generates significantly better queries for crossSIEM threat detection and incident investigation compared to the state-of-the-art base models.</p></details> |  |

However, these systems typically output structured predictions, leaving radiologists responsible for translating results into full narrative reports. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, offer new opportunities to bridge this gap by generating diagnostic narratives from structured findings. This study introduces a pipeline that integrates YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-ray images with a large language model (LLM) to generate natural-language radiology reports. The YOLO models produce bounding-box predictions and class labels, which are then passed to the LLM to generate descriptive findings and clinical summaries. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are compared in terms of detection accuracy, inference latency, and the quality of generated text, as measured by cosine similarity to ground-truth reports. Results show strong semantic similarity between AI and human reports, while human evaluation reveals GPT-4 excels in clarity (4.88/5) but exhibits lower scores for natural writing flow (2.81/5), indicating that current systems achieve clinical accuracy but remain stylistically distinguishable from radiologist-authored text.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improving the stability of the covariance-controlled adaptive Langevin thermostat for large-scale Bayesian sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24515v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and its variants approximate the likelihood of an entire dataset, via random (and typically much smaller) subsets, in the setting of Bayesian sampling. Due to the (often substantial) improvement of the computational efficiency, they have been widely used in large-scale machine learning applications. It has been demonstrated that the so-called covariance-controlled adaptive Langevin (CCAdL) thermostat, which incorporates an additional term involving the covariance matrix of the noisy force, outperforms popular alternative methods. A moving average is used in CCAdL to estimate the covariance matrix of the noisy force, in which case the covariance matrix will converge to a constant matrix in long-time limit. Moreover, it appears in our numerical experiments that the use of a moving average could reduce the stability of the numerical integrators, thereby limiting the largest usable stepsize. In this article, we propose a modified CCAdL (i.e., mCCAdL) thermostat that uses the scaling part of the scaling and squaring method together with a truncated Taylor series approximation to the exponential to numerically approximate the exact solution to the subsystem involving the additional term proposed in CCAdL. We also propose a symmetric splitting method for mCCAdL, instead of an Euler-type discretisation used in the original CCAdL thermostat. We demonstrate in our numerical experiments that the newly proposed mCCAdL thermostat achieves a substantial improvement in the numerical stability over the original CCAdL thermostat, while significantly outperforming popular alternative stochastic gradient methods in terms of the numerical accuracy for large-scale machine learning applications.</p></details> |  |

Recent work has explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as sources of prior causal knowledge, but existing approaches rely on heuristic integration that lacks theoretical grounding. We introduce HOLOGRAPH, a framework that formalizes LLM-guided causal discovery through sheaf theory--representing local causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf over variable subsets. Our key insight is that coherent global causal structure corresponds to the existence of a global section, while topological obstructions manifest as non-vanishing sheaf cohomology. We propose the Algebraic Latent Projection to handle hidden confounders and Natural Gradient Descent on the belief manifold for principled optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HOLOGRAPH provides rigorous mathematical foundations while achieving competitive performance on causal discovery tasks with 50-100 variables. Our sheaf-theoretic analysis reveals that while Identity, Transitivity, and Gluing axioms are satisfied to numerical precision (<10^{-6}), the Locality axiom fails for larger graphs, suggesting fundamental non-local coupling in latent variable projections.

Extremely Large-Scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) are key enablers, with XL-MIMO boosting spectral and energy efficiency through numerous antennas, and RIS offering dynamic control over the wireless environment via passive reflective elements. However, realizing their full potential depends on accurate Channel State Information (CSI). Recent advances in deep learning have facilitated efficient cascaded channel estimation. However, the scalability and practical deployment of existing estimation models in XL-MIMO systems remain limited. The growing number of antennas and RIS elements introduces a significant barrier to real-time and efficient channel estimation, drastically increasing data volume, escalating computational complexity, requiring advanced hardware, and resulting in substantial energy consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for efficient cascaded channel estimation in XL-MIMO systems, designed to minimize computational complexity and make it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Using spatial correlations in the channel, we introduce a patch-based training mechanism that reduces the dimensionality of input to patch-level representations while preserving essential information, allowing scalable training for large-scale systems. Simulation results under diverse conditions demonstrate that our framework significantly improves estimation accuracy and reduces computational complexity, regardless of the increasing number of antennas and RIS elements in XL-MIMO systems.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose radiology Retrieval and Reasoning (RaR), a multi-step retrieval and reasoning framework designed to improve diagnostic accuracy, factual consistency, and clinical reliability of LLMs in radiology question answering. We evaluated 25 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. To assess generalizability, we additionally tested on an unseen internal dataset of 65 real-world radiology board examination questions. RaR significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting and conventional online RAG. The greatest gains occurred in small-scale models, while very large models (>200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally, RaR retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned models showed gains from RaR (e.g., MedGemma-27B), indicating that retrieval remains beneficial despite embedded domain knowledge. These results highlight the potential of RaR to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, warranting future studies to validate their clinical utility. All datasets, code, and the full RaR framework are publicly available to support open research and clinical translation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in npj Digital Medicine</p></details> |

Although recent advances in deep learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially improved performance, most existing approaches still rely on black-box predictions of a single model, making it difficult to structurally explain the cognitive factors underlying sarcasm. Moreover, while sarcasm often emerges as a mismatch between semantic evaluation and normative expectations or intentions, frameworks that explicitly decompose and model these components remain limited. In this work, we reformulate sarcasm understanding as a world model inspired reasoning process and propose World Model inspired SArcasm Reasoning (WM-SAR), which decomposes literal meaning, context, normative expectation, and intention into specialized LLM-based agents. The discrepancy between literal evaluation and normative expectation is explicitly quantified as a deterministic inconsistency score, and together with an intention score, these signals are integrated by a lightweight Logistic Regression model to infer the final sarcasm probability. This design leverages the reasoning capability of LLMs while maintaining an interpretable numerical decision structure. Experiments on representative sarcasm detection benchmarks show that WM-SAR consistently outperforms existing deep learning and LLM-based methods. Ablation studies and case analyses further demonstrate that integrating semantic inconsistency and intention reasoning is essential for effective sarcasm detection, achieving both strong performance and high interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically simplify multi-stage computation resource allocation, neglecting inter-stage dependencies, thus limiting global optimality. In this paper, we propose MaRCA, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for end-to-end computation resource allocation in large-scale recommender systems. MaRCA models the stages of a recommender system as cooperative agents, using Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) to optimize revenue under computation resource constraints. We introduce an AutoBucket TestBench for accurate computation cost estimation, and a Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based Revenue-Cost Balancer to proactively forecast traffic loads and adjust the revenue-cost trade-off accordingly. Since its end-to-end deployment in the advertising pipeline of a leading global e-commerce platform in November 2024, MaRCA has consistently handled hundreds of billions of ad requests per day and has delivered a 16.67% revenue uplift using existing computation resources.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, research is hindered by a lack of public benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, structured dataset from 190 corporate reports, containing ground-truth economic activities and quantitative Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). We use this dataset to conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs on the core compliance workflow. Our results reveal a clear performance gap between qualitative and quantitative tasks. LLMs show moderate success in the qualitative task of identifying economic activities, with a multi-step agentic framework modestly enhancing precision. Conversely, the models comprehensively fail at the quantitative task of predicting financial KPIs in a zero-shot setting. We also discover a paradox, where concise metadata often yields superior performance to full, unstructured reports, and find that model confidence scores are poorly calibrated. We conclude that while LLMs are not ready for full automation, they can serve as powerful assistive tools for human experts. Our dataset provides a public benchmark for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[RxnBench: A Multimodal Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models on Chemical Reaction Understanding from Scientific Literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23565v2)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into chemistry promises to revolutionize scientific discovery, yet their ability to comprehend the dense, graphical language of reactions within authentic literature remains underexplored. Here, we introduce RxnBench, a multi-tiered benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate MLLMs on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs. RxnBench comprises two tasks: Single-Figure QA (SF-QA), which tests fine-grained visual perception and mechanistic reasoning using 1,525 questions derived from 305 curated reaction schemes, and Full-Document QA (FD-QA), which challenges models to synthesize information from 108 articles, requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals a critical capability gap: while models excel at extracting explicit text, they struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Notably, models with inference-time reasoning significantly outperform standard architectures, yet none achieve 50\% accuracy on FD-QA. These findings underscore the urgent need for domain-specific visual encoders and stronger reasoning engines to advance autonomous AI chemists.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Selection for Large-Scale Pre-Training Data via Policy Gradient-based Mask Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24265v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fine-grained data recipe is crucial for pre-training large language models, as it can significantly enhance training efficiency and model performance. One important ingredient in the recipe is to select samples based on scores produced by defined rules, LLM judgment, or statistical information in embeddings, which can be roughly categorized into quality and diversity metrics. Due to the high computational cost when applied to trillion-scale token pre-training datasets such as FineWeb and DCLM, these two or more types of metrics are rarely considered jointly in a single selection process. However, in our empirical study, selecting samples based on quality metrics exhibit severe diminishing returns during long-term pre-training, while selecting on diversity metrics removes too many valuable high-quality samples, both of which limit pre-trained LLMs' capabilities. Therefore, we introduce DATAMASK, a novel and efficient joint learning framework designed for large-scale pre-training data selection that can simultaneously optimize multiple types of metrics in a unified process, with this study focusing specifically on quality and diversity metrics. DATAMASK approaches the selection process as a mask learning problem, involving iterative sampling of data masks, computation of policy gradients based on predefined objectives with sampled masks, and updating of mask sampling logits. Through policy gradient-based optimization and various acceleration enhancements, it significantly reduces selection time by 98.9% compared to greedy algorithm, enabling our study to explore joint learning within trillion-scale tokens. With DATAMASK, we select a subset of about 10% from the 15 trillion-token FineWeb dataset, termed FineWeb-Mask. Evaluated across 12 diverse tasks, we achieves significant improvements of 3.2% on a 1.5B dense model and 1.9% on a 7B MoE model.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniHetero: Could Generation Enhance Understanding for Vision-Language-Model at Large Data Scale?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23512v2)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language large models are moving toward the unification of visual understanding and visual generation tasks. However, whether generation can enhance understanding is still under-explored on large data scale. In this work, we analysis the unified structure with a concise model, UniHetero, under large-scale pretraining (>200M samples). Our key observations are: (1) Generation can improve understanding, but Only if you generate Semantics, Not Pixels. A common assumption in unified vision-language models is that adding generation will naturally strengthen understanding. However, this is not always true at scale. At 200M+ pretraining samples, generation helps understanding only when it operates at the semantic level, i.e. when the model learns to autoregress high-level visual representations inside the LLM. Once pixel-level objectives (e.g., diffusion losses) directly interfere with the LLM, understanding performance often degrades. (2) Generation reveals a superior Data Scaling trend and higher Data Utilization. Unified generation-understanding demonstrates a superior scaling trend compared to understanding alone, revealing a more effective way to learn vision-only knowledge directive from vision modality rather than captioning to text. (3) Autoregression on Input Embedding is effective to capture visual details. Compared to the commonly-used vision encoder, make visual autoregression on input embedding shows less cumulative error and is modality independent, which can be extend to all modalities. The learned semantic representations capture visual information such as objects, locations, shapes, and colors; further enable pixel-level image generation.</p></details> |  |

IMDD-1M contains high-resolution real-world defects spanning over 60 material categories and more than 400 defect types, each accompanied by expert-verified annotations and fine-grained textual descriptions detailing defect location, severity, and contextual attributes. This dataset enables a wide spectrum of applications, including classification, segmentation, retrieval, captioning, and generative modeling. Building upon IMDD-1M, we train a diffusion-based vision-language foundation model from scratch, specifically tailored for industrial scenarios. The model serves as a generalizable foundation that can be efficiently adapted to specialized domains through lightweight fine-tuning. With less than 5% of the task-specific data required by dedicated expert models, it achieves comparable performance, highlighting the potential of data-efficient foundation model adaptation for industrial inspection and generation, paving the way for scalable, domain-adaptive, and knowledge-grounded manufacturing intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Emotional World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24149v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World Models serve as tools for understanding the current state of the world and predicting its future dynamics, with broad application potential across numerous fields. As a key component of world knowledge, emotion significantly influences human decision-making. While existing Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown preliminary capability in capturing world knowledge, they primarily focus on modeling physical-world regularities and lack systematic exploration of emotional factors. In this paper, we first demonstrate the importance of emotion in understanding the world by showing that removing emotionally relevant information degrades reasoning performance. Inspired by theory of mind, we further propose a Large Emotional World Model (LEWM). Specifically, we construct the Emotion-Why-How (EWH) dataset, which integrates emotion into causal relationships and enables reasoning about why actions occur and how emotions drive future world states. Based on this dataset, LEWM explicitly models emotional states alongside visual observations and actions, allowing the world model to predict both future states and emotional transitions. Experimental results show that LEWM more accurately predicts emotion-driven social behaviors while maintaining comparable performance to general world models on basic tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogRec: A Cognitive Recommender Agent Fusing Large Language Models and Soar for Explainable Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24113v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable capacity in understanding user preferences for recommendation systems. However, they are constrained by several critical challenges, including their inherent "Black-Box" characteristics, susceptibility to knowledge hallucination, and limited online learning capacity. These factors compromise their trustworthiness and adaptability. Conversely, cognitive architectures such as Soar offer structured and interpretable reasoning processes, yet their knowledge acquisition is notoriously laborious. To address these complementary challenges, we propose a novel cognitive recommender agent called CogRec which synergizes the strengths of LLMs with the Soar cognitive architecture. CogRec leverages Soar as its core symbolic reasoning engine and leverages an LLM for knowledge initialization to populate its working memory with production rules. The agent operates on a Perception-Cognition-Action(PCA) cycle. Upon encountering an impasse, it dynamically queries the LLM to obtain a reasoned solution. This solution is subsequently transformed into a new symbolic production rule via Soar's chunking mechanism, thereby enabling robust online learning. This learning paradigm allows the agent to continuously evolve its knowledge base and furnish highly interpretable rationales for its recommendations. Extensive evaluations conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that CogRec demonstrates significant advantages in recommendation accuracy, explainability, and its efficacy in addressing the long-tail problem.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Systematic Survey on Large Language Models for Algorithm Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14716v4)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithm design is crucial for effective problem-solving across various domains. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has notably enhanced the automation and innovation within this field, offering new perspectives and promising solutions. In just a few years, this integration has yielded remarkable progress in areas ranging from combinatorial optimization to scientific discovery. Despite this rapid expansion, a holistic understanding of the field is hindered by the lack of a systematic review, as existing surveys either remain limited to narrow sub-fields or with different objectives. This paper seeks to provide a systematic review of algorithm design with LLMs. We introduce a taxonomy that categorises the roles of LLMs as optimizers, predictors, extractors and designers, analyzing the progress, advantages, and limitations within each category. We further synthesize literature across the three phases of the algorithm design pipeline and across diverse algorithmic applications that define the current landscape. Finally, we outline key open challenges and opportunities to guide future research.</p></details> |  |

To address this overlooked risk, we first propose a novel attack paradigm, Reasoning-Activated Jailbreak (RAJ) via Concretization, which demonstrates that refining malicious prompts to be more specific can trigger step-by-step logical reasoning that overrides the model's safety protocols. To systematically mitigate this vulnerability, we further develop a scalable framework for constructing high-quality safety alignment datasets. This framework first leverages the RAJ attack to elicit challenging harmful reasoning chains from LRMs, then transforms these high-risk traces into safe, constructive, and educational responses through a tailored Principle-Guided Alignment (PGA) mechanism. Then, we introduce the PGA dataset, a verified alignment dataset containing 3,989 samples using our proposed method. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning LRMs with PGA dataset significantly enhances model safety, achieving up to a 29.5% improvement in defense success rates across multiple jailbreak benchmarks. Critically, our approach not only defends against sophisticated reasoning-based attacks but also preserves, even enhances, the model's general reasoning capabilities. This work provides a scalable and effective pathway for safety alignment in reasoning-intensive AI systems, addressing the core trade-off between safety and functional performance.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

They often make overconfident errors, degrade under input shifts, and lack clear uncertainty estimates. Existing evaluations are fragmented, addressing only isolated aspects. We introduce the Composite Reliability Score (CRS), a unified framework that integrates calibration, robustness, and uncertainty quantification into a single interpretable metric. Through experiments on ten leading open-source LLMs across five QA datasets, we assess performance under baselines, perturbations, and calibration methods. CRS delivers stable model rankings, uncovers hidden failure modes missed by single metrics, and highlights that the most dependable systems balance accuracy, robustness, and calibrated uncertainty.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 tables, accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We introduce MuRating, a scalable framework that transfers high-quality English data-quality signals into a single rater for 17 target languages. MuRating aggregates multiple English "raters" via pairwise comparisons to learn unified document-quality scores,then projects these judgments through translation to train a multilingual evaluator on monolingual, cross-lingual, and parallel text pairs. Applied to web data, MuRating selects balanced subsets of English and multilingual content to pretrain a 1.2 B-parameter LLaMA model. Compared to strong baselines, including QuRater, AskLLM, DCLM and so on, our approach boosts average accuracy on both English benchmarks and multilingual evaluations, with especially large gains on knowledge-intensive tasks. We further analyze translation fidelity, selection biases, and underrepresentation of narrative material, outlining directions for future work.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 poster |

We analyze these grounding failures and identify a distinct taxonomy: Event Omission, False Event Identity, Temporal Relation Error, and Quantitative Temporal Error. To address this, we introduce the AHA (Audio Hallucination Alignment) framework. By leveraging counterfactual hard negative mining, our pipeline constructs a high-quality preference dataset that forces models to distinguish strict acoustic evidence from linguistically plausible fabrications. Additionally, we establish AHA-Eval, a diagnostic benchmark designed to rigorously test these fine-grained temporal reasoning capabilities. We apply this data to align Qwen2.5-Omni. The resulting model, Qwen-Audio-AHA, achieves a 13.7% improvement on AHA-Eval. Crucially, this benefit generalizes beyond our diagnostic set. Our model shows substantial gains on public benchmarks, including 1.3% on MMAU-Test and 1.6% on MMAR, outperforming latest SOTA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Unit Test Generation: Achievements, Challenges, and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21382v2)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated unit test generation is critical for software quality but traditional structure-driven methods often lack the semantic understanding required to produce realistic inputs and oracles. Large language models (LLMs) address this limitation by leveraging their extensive data-driven knowledge of code semantics and programming patterns. To analyze the state of the art in this domain, we conducted a systematic literature review of 115 publications published between May 2021 and August 2025. We propose a taxonomy based on the unit test generation lifecycle that divides the process into a generative phase for creating test artifacts and a quality assurance phase for refining them. Our analysis reveals that prompt engineering has emerged as the dominant utilization approach and accounts for 89% of the studies due to its flexibility. We find that iterative validation and repair loops have become the standard mechanism to ensure robust usability by significantly improving compilation and execution pass rates. However, critical challenges remain regarding the weak fault detection capabilities and the lack of standardized benchmarks. We conclude with a roadmap for future research that emphasizes the progression toward autonomous testing agents and hybrid systems combining LLMs with traditional software engineering tools.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |

However, generating accurate and effective textual plans remains challenging due to LLM hallucinations and the high diversity of task-specific questions. To address this, we draw inspiration from human Implicit Cognition (IC), the subconscious process by which decisions are guided by compact, generalized patterns learned from past experiences without requiring explicit verbalization. We propose iCLP, a novel framework that enables LLMs to adaptively generate latent plans (LPs), which are compact encodings of effective reasoning instructions. iCLP first distills explicit plans from existing step-by-step reasoning trajectories. It then learns discrete representations of these plans via a vector-quantized autoencoder coupled with a codebook. Finally, by fine-tuning LLMs on paired latent plans and corresponding reasoning steps, the models learn to perform implicit planning during reasoning. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate that, with iCLP, LLMs can plan in latent space while reasoning in language space. This approach yields significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency and, crucially, demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization while preserving the interpretability of chain-of-thought reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures.

| **[ITDR: An Instruction Tuning Dataset for Enhancing Large Language Models in Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05667v2)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in natural language processing tasks. However, in the field of recommender systems, due to the inherent structural discrepancy between user behavior data and natural language, LLMs struggle to effectively model the associations between user preferences and items. Although prompt-based methods can generate recommendation results, their inadequate understanding of recommendation tasks leads to constrained performance. To address this gap, we construct a comprehensive instruction tuning dataset, ITDR, which encompasses seven subtasks across two root tasks: user-item interaction and user-item understanding. The dataset integrates data from 13 public recommendation datasets and is built using manually crafted standardized templates, comprising approximately 200,000 instances. Experimental results demonstrate that ITDR significantly enhances the performance of mainstream open-source LLMs such as GLM-4, Qwen2.5, Qwen2.5-Instruct and LLaMA-3.2 on recommendation tasks. Furthermore, we analyze the correlations between tasks and explore the impact of task descriptions and data scale on instruction tuning effectiveness. Finally, we perform comparative experiments against closed-source LLMs with massive parameters. Our tuning dataset ITDR, the fine-tuned large recommendation models, all LoRA modules, and the complete experimental results are available at https://github.com/hellolzk/ITDR.</p></details> |  |

However, existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in the diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks. To tackle these gaps, we construct ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task instruction dataset that encompasses four complementary tasks including change captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change localization. Building upon this new dataset, we further design a novel vision-guided vision-language model (ChangeVG) with dual-granularity awareness for bi-temporal remote sensing images (i.e., two remote sensing images of the same area at different times). The introduced vision-guided module is a dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization. These enriched representations further serve as the auxiliary prompts to guide large vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) during instruction tuning, thereby facilitating the hierarchical cross-modal learning. We extensively conduct experiments across four tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Remarkably, on the change captioning task, our method outperforms the strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric, which integrates the semantic similarity and descriptive accuracy to provide an overall evaluation of change caption. Moreover, we also perform a series of ablation studies to examine the critical components of our method.

While symbolic AI has been applied in healthcare, its adoption remains limited due to the effort required for constructing high-quality knowledge bases. This work introduces McCoy, a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to overcome this barrier. McCoy orchestrates an LLM to translate medical literature into ASP code, combines it with patient data, and processes it using an ASP solver to arrive at the final diagnosis. This integration yields a robust, interpretable prediction framework that leverages the strengths of both paradigms. Preliminary results show McCoy has strong performance on small-scale disease diagnosis tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forgetting: A New Mechanism Towards Better Large Language Model Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04329v4)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) plays a critical role for pretrained large language models (LLMs), notably enhancing their capacity to acquire domain-specific knowledge while preserving or potentially augmenting their general-purpose capabilities. However, the efficacy of SFT hinges on data quality as well as data volume, otherwise it may result in limited performance gains or even degradation relative to the associated baselines. To mitigate such reliance, we suggest categorizing tokens within each corpus into two parts -- positive and negative tokens -- based on whether they are useful to improve model performance. Positive tokens can be trained in common ways, whereas negative tokens, which may lack essential semantics or be misleading, should be explicitly forgotten. Overall, the token categorization facilitate the model to learn less informative message, and the forgetting process shapes a knowledge boundary to guide the model on what information to learn more precisely. We conduct experiments across diverse and well-established benchmarks using various model architectures, demonstrating that this forgetting mechanism enhances model performance.</p></details> |  |

To this end, offline multiobjective alignment algorithms such as the Rewards-in-Context algorithm have shown strong performance and efficiency. However, inappropriate preference representations and training with imbalanced reward scores limit the performance of such algorithms. In this work, we introduce ParetoHqD that addresses the above issues by representing human preferences as preference directions in the objective space and regarding data near the Pareto front as "high-quality" data. For each preference, ParetoHqD follows a two-stage supervised fine-tuning process, where each stage uses an individual Pareto high-quality training set that best matches its preference direction. The experimental results have demonstrated the superiority of ParetoHqD over five baselines on two multiobjective alignment tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a main conference paper at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

When AI mediates between the public and policymakers, accuracy across intersecting identities becomes consequential; inaccurate group-level estimates can mislead outreach, consultation, and policy design. While research examines intersectionality in LLM outputs, no study has compared these outputs against real human responses across intersecting identities. Climate policy is one such domain, and this is particularly urgent for climate change, where opinion is contested and diverse. We investigate how LLMs represent intersectional patterns in U.S. climate opinions. We prompted six LLMs with profiles of 978 respondents from a nationally representative U.S. climate opinion survey and compared AI-generated responses to actual human answers across 20 questions. We find that LLMs appear to compress the diversity of American climate opinions, predicting less-concerned groups as more concerned and vice versa. This compression is intersectional: LLMs apply uniform gender assumptions that match reality for White and Hispanic Americans but misrepresent Black Americans, where actual gender patterns differ. These patterns, which may be invisible to standard auditing approaches, could undermine equitable climate governance.</p></details> |  |

We propose a universal targeted latent space attack, an encoder-level adversarial attack that manipulates audio latent representations to induce attacker-specified outputs in downstream language generation. Unlike prior waveform-level or input-specific attacks, our approach learns a universal perturbation that generalizes across inputs and speakers and does not require access to the language model. Experiments on Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct demonstrate consistently high attack success rates with minimal perceptual distortion, revealing a critical and previously underexplored attack surface at the encoder level of multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Divergent-Convergent Thinking in Large Language Models for Creative Problem Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23601v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have significant potential for generating educational questions and problems, enabling educators to create large-scale learning materials. However, LLMs are fundamentally limited by the ``Artificial Hivemind'' effect, where they generate similar responses within the same model and produce homogeneous outputs across different models. As a consequence, students may be exposed to overly similar and repetitive LLM-generated problems, which harms diversity of thought. Drawing inspiration from Wallas's theory of creativity and Guilford's framework of divergent-convergent thinking, we propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that explicitly scaffolds the LLM's reasoning into distinct phases. By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, our method enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to a final problem. We evaluate CreativeDC for creative problem generation using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity, novelty, and utility. The results show that CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility. Moreover, scaling analysis shows that CreativeDC generates a larger effective number of distinct problems as more are sampled, increasing at a faster rate than baseline methods.</p></details> | Preprint |

A Large-scale Study on Security Risks in LLM and Agentic Automated Program Repair on SWE-bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02976v3)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and their agentic frameworks are increasingly adopted to perform development tasks such as automated program repair (APR). While prior work has identified security risks in LLM-generated code, most have focused on synthetic, simplified, or isolated tasks that lack the complexity of real-world program repair. In this study, we present the first large-scale security analysis of LLM-generated patches using 20,000+ GitHub issues. We evaluate patches proposed by developers, a standalone LLM (Llama 3.3 Instruct-70B), and three top-performing agentic frameworks (OpenHands, AutoCodeRover, HoneyComb). Finally, we analyze a wide range of code, issue, and project-level factors to understand the conditions under which generating insecure patches is more likely. Our findings reveal that Llama introduces many new vulnerabilities, exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code. Agentic workflows also generate a number of vulnerabilities, particularly when given more autonomy. We find that vulnerabilities in LLM-generated patches are associated with distinctive code characteristics and are commonly observed in issues missing specific types of information. These results suggest that contextual factors play a critical role in the security of the generated patches and point toward the need for proactive risk assessment methods that account for both issue and code-level information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instruction-Following Evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23572v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following the initial flourishing of large language models (LLMs), there has been a surge in proposed large vision-language models (LVLMs) that integrate LLMs with vision capabilities. However, it has been observed that LVLMs, after tuning to visual instruction using commonly used training datasets, often fail to exhibit the instruction-following ability that was present in the LLM before integration, leading to results in which they do not follow task instructions as expected. This study quantitatively demonstrates that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning and analyzes its underlying causes. In particular, we constructed new training datasets highlighting whether the output format is specified. Then, we investigated how explicitly indicating the output format during fine-tuning affects LVLMs' instruction-following ability. Our quantitative evaluation confirmed that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning with commonly used datasets. Furthermore, we found that LVLMs trained with datasets, including instructions on output format, tend to follow instructions more accurately than models that do not. These findings suggest that including samples with instructions on output format during (visual) instruction tuning may help mitigate the decline in instruction-following abilities.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically leverage to circumvent safety mechanisms. We empirically evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent. The exception was Claude Opus 4.1, which prioritized intent detection over information provision in some use cases. This pattern reveals that current architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities. These limitations require paradigmatic shifts toward contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities rather than post-hoc protective mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages and 23 figures</p></details> |

Despite their prowess, the intrinsic generative abilities of LLMs may prove insufficient for handling complex tasks which necessitate a combination of task planning and the usage of external tools. In this paper, we first propose a structured framework tailored for LLM-based AI Agents and discuss the crucial capabilities necessary for tackling intricate problems. Within this framework, we design two distinct types of agents (i.e., one-step agent and sequential agent) to execute the inference process. Subsequently, we instantiate the framework using various LLMs and evaluate their Task Planning and Tool Usage (TPTU) abilities on typical tasks. By highlighting key findings and challenges, our goal is to provide a helpful resource for researchers and practitioners to leverage the power of LLMs in their AI applications. Our study emphasizes the substantial potential of these models, while also identifying areas that need more investigation and improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS-2023 Workshop on Foundation Models for Decision Making</p></details> |

While LLM-embeddings are frequently used to store and retrieve text by semantic similarity in vector databases, the global structure semantic relationships in text corpora often remains opaque. Herein we propose a nested density clustering approach, to infer hierarchical trees of semantically related texts. The method starts by identifying texts of strong semantic similarity as it searches for dense clusters in LLM embedding space. As the density criterion is gradually relaxed, these dense clusters merge into more diffuse clusters, until the whole dataset is represented by a single cluster -- the root of the tree. By embedding dense clusters into increasingly diffuse ones, we construct a tree structure that captures hierarchical semantic relationships among texts. We outline how this approach can be used to classify textual data for abstracts of scientific abstracts as a case study. This enables the data-driven discovery research areas and their subfields without predefined categories. To evaluate the general applicability of the method, we further apply it to established benchmark datasets such as the 20 Newsgroups and IMDB 50k Movie Reviews, demonstrating its robustness across domains. Finally we discuss possible applications on scientometrics, topic evolution, highlighting how nested density trees can reveal semantic structure and evolution in textual datasets.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Analyzing Cognitive Differences Among Large Language Models through the Lens of Social Worldview](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01967v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models significantly influence social interactions, decision-making, and information dissemination, underscoring the need to understand the implicit socio-cognitive attitudes, referred to as "worldviews", encoded within these systems. Unlike previous studies predominantly addressing demographic and ethical biases as fixed attributes, our study explores deeper cognitive orientations toward authority, equality, autonomy, and fate, emphasizing their adaptability in dynamic social contexts. We introduce the Social Worldview Taxonomy (SWT), an evaluation framework grounded in Cultural Theory, operationalizing four canonical worldviews, namely Hierarchy, Egalitarianism, Individualism, and Fatalism, into quantifiable sub-dimensions. Through extensive analysis of 28 diverse LLMs, we identify distinct cognitive profiles reflecting intrinsic model-specific socio-cognitive structures. Leveraging principles from Social Referencing Theory, our experiments demonstrate that explicit social cues systematically modulate these profiles, revealing robust patterns of cognitive adaptability. Our findings provide insights into the latent cognitive flexibility of LLMs and offer computational scientists practical pathways toward developing more transparent, interpretable, and socially responsible AI systems</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Knowledge Guided Pretraining Approaches for Multimodal Foundation Models: Applications in Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19660v4)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for pretraining foundation models using large-scale data. Existing pretraining approaches predominantly rely on masked reconstruction or next-token prediction strategies, demonstrating strong performance across various downstream tasks, including geoscience applications. However, these approaches do not fully capture the knowledge of causal interplay between different geospatial and environmental variables. To address this limitation, we propose Knowledge Guided Variable-Step Forecasting (KG-VSF), a novel pretraining task that models forecasting as a conditional generation task, where driver variables (e.g., weather) inform the prediction of response variables (e.g., satellite imagery). We demonstrate that pretraining in such a fashion leads to strong embeddings which give enhanced performance when finetuned on downstream tasks where capturing this causality matters such as pixel wise crop type mapping, soil moisture estimation and forecasting, missing image prediction, and future image forecasting when compared to finetuning embeddings from other standard pretraining approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages with appendix</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking ERP Analysis: Manual Features, Deep Learning, and Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00573v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-related potential (ERP), a specialized paradigm of electroencephalographic (EEG), reflects neurological responses to external stimuli or events, generally associated with the brain's processing of specific cognitive tasks. ERP plays a critical role in cognitive analysis, the detection of neurological diseases, and the assessment of psychological states. Recent years have seen substantial advances in deep learning-based methods for spontaneous EEG and other non-time-locked task-related EEG signals. However, their effectiveness on ERP data remains underexplored, and many existing ERP studies still rely heavily on manually extracted features. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study that systematically compares traditional manual features (followed by a linear classifier), deep learning models, and pre-trained EEG foundation models for ERP analysis. We establish a unified data preprocessing and training pipeline and evaluate these approaches on two representative tasks, ERP stimulus classification and ERP-based brain disease detection, across 12 publicly available datasets. Furthermore, we investigate various patch-embedding strategies within advanced Transformer architectures to identify embedding designs that better suit ERP data. Our study provides a landmark framework to guide method selection and tailored model design for future ERP analysis. The code is available at https://github.com/DL4mHealth/ERP-Benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Understanding how foundation model (FM) agents understand and act in such environments is therefore critical for enabling reliable map-based reasoning and applications. However, most existing evaluations of spatial ability in FMs rely on static map inputs or text-based queries, overlooking the interactive and experience-driven nature of spatial understanding.In this paper, we propose an interactive evaluation framework to analyze how FM agents explore, remember, and reason in symbolic map environments. Agents incrementally explore partially observable grid-based maps consisting of roads, intersections, and points of interest (POIs), receiving only local observations at each step. Spatial understanding is then evaluated using six kinds of spatial tasks. By systematically varying exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes across multiple foundation models, we reveal distinct functional roles of these components. Exploration primarily affects experience acquisition but has a limited impact on final reasoning accuracy. In contrast, memory representation plays a central role in consolidating spatial experience, with structured memories particularly sequential and graph-based representations, substantially improving performance on structure-intensive tasks such as path planning. Reasoning schemes further shape how stored spatial knowledge is used, with advanced prompts supporting more effective multi-step inference. We further observe that spatial reasoning performance saturates across model versions and scales beyond a certain capability threshold, indicating that improvements in map-based spatial understanding require mechanisms tailored to spatial representation and reasoning rather than scaling alone.</p></details> | 43 pages, 8 figures |
| **[A Comparative Study of Adaptation Strategies for Time Series Foundation Models in Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00446v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is essential for the reliable operation of complex systems, but most existing methods require extensive task-specific training. We explore whether time series foundation models (TSFMs), pretrained on large heterogeneous data, can serve as universal backbones for anomaly detection. Through systematic experiments across multiple benchmarks, we compare zero-shot inference, full model adaptation, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies. Our results demonstrate that TSFMs outperform task-specific baselines, achieving notable gains in AUC-PR and VUS-PR, particularly under severe class imbalance. Moreover, PEFT methods such as LoRA, OFT, and HRA not only reduce computational cost but also match or surpass full fine-tuning in most cases, indicating that TSFMs can be efficiently adapted for anomaly detection, even when pretrained for forecasting. These findings position TSFMs as promising general-purpose models for scalable and efficient time series anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

Our core idea is to bridge flow estimation with geometric reasoning by leveraging the guidance from foundation depth models. To this end, we first develop a Hybrid Flow Network that produces geometry-aware correspondences, enabling consistent depth and pose inference across diverse keyframes. To enforce global consistency, we propose a Bi-Consistent Bundle Adjustment Layer that jointly optimizes keyframe pose and depth under multi-view constraints. Furthermore, we introduce a Reliability-Aware Refinement mechanism that dynamically adapts the flow update process by distinguishing between reliable and uncertain regions, forming a closed feedback loop between matching and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FoundationSLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and dense reconstruction quality across multiple challenging datasets, while running in real-time at 18 FPS, demonstrating strong generalization to various scenarios and practical applicability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept at AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Traffic-MoE: A Sparse Foundation Model for Network Traffic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00357v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While pre-trained large models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in network traffic analysis, their prohibitive computational costs hinder deployment in real-time, throughput-sensitive network defense environments. This work bridges the gap between advanced representation learning and practical network protection by introducing Traffic-MoE, a sparse foundation model optimized for high-efficiency real-time inference. By dynamically routing traffic tokens to a small subset of specialized experts, Traffic-MoE effectively decouples model capacity from computational overhead. Extensive evaluations across three security-oriented tasks demonstrate that Traffic-MoE achieves up to a 12.38% improvement in detection performance compared to leading dense competitors. Crucially, it delivers a 91.62% increase in throughput, reduces inference latency by 47.81%, and cuts peak GPU memory consumption by 38.72%. Beyond efficiency, Traffic-MoE exhibits superior robustness against adversarial traffic shaping and maintains high detection efficacy in few-shot scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for scalable and resilient network traffic analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[TotalFM: An Organ-Separated Framework for 3D-CT Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00260v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While foundation models in radiology are expected to be applied to various clinical tasks, computational cost constraints remain a major challenge when training on 3D-CT volumetric data. In this study, we propose TotalFM, a radiological foundation model that efficiently learns the correspondence between 3D-CT images and linguistic expressions based on the concept of organ separation, utilizing a large-scale dataset of 140,000 series. By automating the creation of organ volume and finding-sentence pairs through segmentation techniques and Large Language Model (LLM)-based radiology report processing, and by combining self-supervised pre-training via VideoMAE with contrastive learning using volume-text pairs, we aimed to balance computational efficiency and representation capability. In zero-shot organ-wise lesion classification tasks, the proposed model achieved higher F1 scores in 83% (5/6) of organs compared to CT-CLIP and 64% (9/14) of organs compared to Merlin. These results suggest that the proposed model exhibits high generalization performance in a clinical evaluation setting using actual radiology report sentences. Furthermore, in zero-shot finding-wise lesion classification tasks, our model achieved a higher AUROC in 83% (25/30) of finding categories compared to Merlin. We also confirmed performance comparable to existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in radiology report generation tasks. Our results demonstrate that the organ-separated learning framework can serve as a realistic and effective design guideline for the practical implementation of 3D-CT foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generalisable Foundation Models for Brain MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23415v3)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale, unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms. It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.</p></details> |  |

Exotic expressions involving sets related to formulas of unlimited quantifiers height appear mostly in esoteric or foundational studies. Recognizing internal to math (formula-specified) and external (based on parameters in those formulas) aspects of math objects greatly simplifies foundations. I postulate external sets (not internally specified, constituting the domain of variables) to be hereditarily countable and independent of formula-defined classes, i.e. with finite algorithmic information about them. This allows to eliminate all non-integer quantifiers in Set Theory sentences. All with seemingly no need to change almost anything in mathematical papers, only to reinterpret some formalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages article + 17 pages slides</p></details> |
| **[GenZ: Foundational models as latent variable generators within traditional statistical models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24834v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features. While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[TALO: Pushing 3D Vision Foundation Models Towards Globally Consistent Online Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02341v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D vision foundation models have shown strong generalization in reconstructing key 3D attributes from uncalibrated images through a single feed-forward pass. However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

Through contrastive learning and multi-task optimization, ALF creates unified advertiser representations that capture both content and behavioral patterns. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on critical tasks including fraud detection, policy violation identification, and advertiser similarity matching. In production deployment, ALF demonstrates significant real-world impact by delivering simultaneous gains in both precision and recall, for instance boosting recall by over 40 percentage points on one critical policy and increasing precision to 99.8% on another. The architecture's effectiveness stems from its novel combination of multi-modal transformations, inter-sample attention mechanism, spectrally normalized projections, and calibrated probabilistic outputs.</p></details> | KDD 2026 ADS Track |
| **[F2IDiff: Real-world Image Super-resolution using Feature to Image Diffusion Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24473v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of Generative AI, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) quality has seen substantial improvement, as the strong priors learned by Text-2-Image Diffusion (T2IDiff) Foundation Models (FM) can bridge the gap between High-Resolution (HR) and Low-Resolution (LR) images. However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM). Lower level features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation models on the bridge: Semantic hazard detection and safety maneuvers for maritime autonomy with vision-language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24470v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The draft IMO MASS Code requires autonomous and remotely supervised maritime vessels to detect departures from their operational design domain, enter a predefined fallback that notifies the operator, permit immediate human override, and avoid changing the voyage plan without approval. Meeting these obligations in the alert-to-takeover gap calls for a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver. Classical maritime autonomy stacks struggle when the correct action depends on meaning (e.g., diver-down flag means people in the water, fire close by means hazard). We argue (i) that vision-language models (VLMs) provide semantic awareness for such out-of-distribution situations, and (ii) that a fast-slow anomaly pipeline with a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver makes this practical in the handover window. We introduce Semantic Lookout, a camera-only, candidate-constrained vision-language model (VLM) fallback maneuver selector that selects one cautious action (or station-keeping) from water-valid, world-anchored trajectories under continuous human authority. On 40 harbor scenes we measure per-call scene understanding and latency, alignment with human consensus (model majority-of-three voting), short-horizon risk-relief on fire hazard scenes, and an on-water alert->fallback maneuver->operator handover. Sub-10 s models retain most of the awareness of slower state-of-the-art models. The fallback maneuver selector outperforms geometry-only baselines and increases standoff distance on fire scenes. A field run verifies end-to-end operation. These results support VLMs as semantic fallback maneuver selectors compatible with the draft IMO MASS Code, within practical latency budgets, and motivate future work on domain-adapted, hybrid autonomy that pairs foundation-model semantics with multi-sensor bird's-eye-view perception and short-horizon replanning.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages without bibliography or appendix.

We develop and validate Virtual-Eyes, a clinically motivated 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline, and measure its differential impact on generalist foundation models versus specialist models. Virtual-Eyes enforces strict 512x512 in-plane resolution, rejects short or non-diagnostic series, and extracts a contiguous lung block using Hounsfield-unit filtering and bilateral lung-coverage scoring while preserving the native 16-bit grid. Using 765 NLST patients (182 cancer, 583 non-cancer), we compute slice-level embeddings from RAD-DINO and Merlin with frozen encoders and train leakage-free patient-level MLP heads; we also evaluate Sybil and a 2D ResNet-18 baseline under Raw versus Virtual-Eyes inputs without backbone retraining. Virtual-Eyes improves RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and from 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with improved calibration (Brier score 0.188 to 0.112). In contrast, Sybil and ResNet-18 degrade under Virtual-Eyes (Sybil AUC 0.886 to 0.837; ResNet-18 AUC 0.571 to 0.596) with evidence of context dependence and shortcut learning, and Merlin shows limited transferability (AUC approximately 0.507 to 0.567) regardless of preprocessing. These results demonstrate that anatomically targeted QC can stabilize and improve generalist foundation-model workflows but may disrupt specialist models adapted to raw clinical context.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, and Under Review-MIDL-2026</p></details> |

Current state-of-the-art FER models tend to have weak generalization when tested on diverse data, leading to deteriorated performance in the real world and hindering FER as a research domain. Though researchers have proposed complex architectures to address this generalization issue, they require training cross-domain to obtain generalizable results, which is inherently contradictory for real-world application. Our model, MotivNet, achieves competitive performance across datasets without cross-domain training by using Meta-Sapiens as a backbone. Sapiens is a human vision foundational model with state-of-the-art generalization in the real world through large-scale pretraining of a Masked Autoencoder. We propose MotivNet as an additional downstream task for Sapiens and define three criteria to evaluate MotivNet's viability as a Sapiens task: benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity. Throughout this paper, we describe the components of MotivNet, our training approach, and our results showing MotivNet is generalizable across domains. We demonstrate that MotivNet can be benchmarked against existing SOTA models and meets the listed criteria, validating MotivNet as a Sapiens downstream task, and making FER more incentivizing for in-the-wild application.

In this work, we explore scaling up multimodal foundation models to cultivate spatial intelligence within the SenseNova-SI family, built upon established multimodal foundations including visual understanding models (i.e., Qwen3-VL and InternVL3) and unified understanding and generation models (i.e., Bagel). We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application. SenseNova-SI is an ongoing project, and this report will be updated continuously. All newly trained multimodal foundation models are publicly released to facilitate further research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codeb...</summary><p>Codebase: https://github.com/OpenSenseNova/SenseNova-SI ; Models: https://huggingface.co/collections/sensenova/sensenova-si</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Remote Sensing Foundation Models: Data Domain Tradeoffs at the Peta-Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23903v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the scaling behaviors of artificial intelligence to establish practical techniques for training foundation models on high-resolution electro-optical (EO) datasets that exceed the current state-of-the-art scale by orders of magnitude. Modern multimodal machine learning (ML) applications, such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems for image captioning, search, and reasoning, depend on robust, domain-specialized encoders for non-text modalities. In natural-image domains where internet-scale data is plentiful, well-established scaling laws help optimize the joint scaling of model capacity, training compute, and dataset size. Unfortunately, these relationships are much less well-understood in high-value domains like remote sensing (RS). Using over a quadrillion pixels of commercial satellite EO data and the MITRE Federal AI Sandbox, we train progressively larger vision transformer (ViT) backbones, report success and failure modes observed at petascale, and analyze implications for bridging domain gaps across additional RS modalities. We observe that even at this scale, performance is consistent with a data limited regime rather than a model parameter-limited one. These practical insights are intended to inform data-collection strategies, compute budgets, and optimization schedules that advance the future development of frontier-scale RS foundation models.</p></details> |  |

In the context of next-generation wireless networks, integrating sensing and communication modalities presents a unique opportunity to develop generalizable and data-efficient models. In this work, we introduce the contrastive learning based Wireless Multimodal Foundation Model (WMFM), a large-scale framework that jointly learns from wireless channel coefficients and visual imagery. The WMFM is pretrained using contrastive learning, a self-supervised learning technique that aligns embeddings of camera and channel data without requiring explicit labels. The pretrained encoders are then frozen and employed as feature extractors, with lightweight task-specific heads, fine-tuned for downstream tasks, including user localization and LoS/nLoS classification. Extensive experiments on the DeepVerse6G dataset demonstrate that the proposed WMFM achieves a 17% improvement in balanced accuracy for LoS/nLoS classification and a 48.5% reduction in localization error compared to the end-to-end (E2E) benchmark, while reducing training time by up to 90-fold. Even when trained with as little as 20% of the data, the WMFM-based heads outperform the fully supervised E2E model, underscoring their robustness and data-efficient learning. The proposed approach establishes a foundation for scalable, multimodal learning in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems, paving the way for intelligent and adaptive 6G networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal Paper, 13 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Breaking Data Silos: Towards Open and Scalable Mobility Foundation Models via Generative Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06694v6)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility is a fundamental pillar of urban science and sustainability, providing critical insights into energy consumption, carbon emissions, and public health. However, the discovery of universal mobility laws is currently hindered by the ``data silo'' problem, where institutional boundaries and privacy regulations fragment the necessary large-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose MoveGCL, a transformative framework that facilitates collaborative and decentralized mobility science via generative continual learning. MoveGCL enables a distributed ecosystem of data holders to jointly evolve a foundation model without compromising individual privacy. The core of MoveGCL lies in its ability to replay synthetic trajectories derived from a generative teacher and utilize a mobility-pattern-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This allows the model to encapsulate the unique characteristics of diverse urban structures while mitigating the risk of knowledge erosion (catastrophic forgetting). With a specialized layer-wise progressive adaptation strategy, MoveGCL ensures stable convergence during the continuous integration of new urban domains. Our experiments on six global urban datasets demonstrate that MoveGCL achieves performance parity with joint training, a previously unattainable feat under siloed conditions. This work provides a scalable, privacy-preserving pathway toward Open Mobility Science, empowering researchers to address global sustainability challenges through cross-institutional AI collaboration. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we have released the code and models at \color{blue}{https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoveGCL}.</p></details> |  |

Our characterizations involve novel models of Bayesian persuasion, where the principal can steer the agent's bias after acquiring costly information. Importantly, we provide an elicitation method using only observable menu-choice data of the principal, which shows how to construct the principal's subjective costs of acquiring information even when he anticipates managing the agent's bias.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical Foundations of Scaling Law in Familial Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23407v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural scaling laws have become foundational for optimizing large language model (LLM) training, yet they typically assume a single dense model output. This limitation effectively overlooks "Familial models, a transformative paradigm essential for realizing ubiquitous intelligence across heterogeneous device-edge-cloud hierarchies. Transcending static architectures, familial models integrate early exits with relay-style inference to spawn G deployable sub-models from a single shared backbone. In this work, we theoretically and empirically extend the scaling law to capture this "one-run, many-models" paradigm by introducing Granularity (G) as a fundamental scaling variable alongside model size (N) and training tokens (D). To rigorously quantify this relationship, we propose a unified functional form L(N, D, G) and parameterize it using large-scale empirical runs. Specifically, we employ a rigorous IsoFLOP experimental design to strictly isolate architectural impact from computational scale. Across fixed budgets, we systematically sweep model sizes (N) and granularities (G) while dynamically adjusting tokens (D). This approach effectively decouples the marginal cost of granularity from the benefits of scale, ensuring high-fidelity parameterization of our unified scaling law. Our results reveal that the granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent. Theoretically, this bridges fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures. Practically, it validates the "train once, deploy many" paradigm, demonstrating that deployment flexibility is achievable without compromising the compute-optimality of dense baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Event Reasoning and Prediction by Fusing World Knowledge from LLMs with Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05822v3)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video understanding models excel at recognizing "what" is happening but fall short in high-level cognitive tasks like causal reasoning and future prediction, a limitation rooted in their lack of commonsense world knowledge. To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks. Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding, paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics, human-computer interaction, and beyond.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Agentic Physical AI toward a Domain-Specific Foundation Model for Nuclear Reactor Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23292v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevailing paradigm in AI for physical systems, scaling general-purpose foundation models toward universal multimodal reasoning, confronts a fundamental barrier at the control interface. Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy. Learned representations transfer across distinct physics and continuous input modalities without architectural modification.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we present Omni-Weather, the first multimodal foundation model that unifies weather generation and understanding within a single architecture. Omni-Weather integrates a radar encoder for weather generation tasks, followed by unified processing using a shared self-attention mechanism. Moreover, we construct a Chain-of-Thought dataset for causal reasoning in weather generation, enabling interpretable outputs and improved perceptual quality. Extensive experiments show Omni-Weather achieves state-of-the-art performance in both weather generation and understanding. Our findings further indicate that generative and understanding tasks in the weather domain can mutually enhance each other. Omni-Weather also demonstrates the feasibility and value of unifying weather generation and understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[RS-Prune: Training-Free Data Pruning at High Ratios for Efficient Remote Sensing Diffusion Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23239v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based remote sensing (RS) generative foundation models are cruial for downstream tasks. However, these models rely on large amounts of globally representative data, which often contain redundancy, noise, and class imbalance, reducing training efficiency and preventing convergence. Existing RS diffusion foundation models typically aggregate multiple classification datasets or apply simplistic deduplication, overlooking the distributional requirements of generation modeling and the heterogeneity of RS imagery. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, two-stage data pruning approach that quickly select a high-quality subset under high pruning ratios, enabling a preliminary foundation model to converge rapidly and serve as a versatile backbone for generation, downstream fine-tuning, and other applications. Our method jointly considers local information content with global scene-level diversity and representativeness. First, an entropy-based criterion efficiently removes low-information samples. Next, leveraging RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, we perform scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling to improve clustering effectiveness while reducing computational costs on large-scale unlabeled data. Finally, by balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness, the method enables fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios while preserving overall diversity and representativeness. Experiments show that, even after pruning 85\% of the training data, our method significantly improves convergence and generation quality. Furthermore, diffusion foundation models trained with our method consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance across downstream tasks, including super-resolution and semantic image synthesis. This data pruning paradigm offers practical guidance for developing RS generative foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, existing multi-operator learning approaches are data-hungry and neglect physics during training. Here, we propose a physics-informed multimodal foundation model (PI-MFM) framework that directly enforces governing equations during pretraining and adaptation. PI-MFM takes symbolic representations of PDEs as the input, and automatically assembles PDE residual losses from the input expression via a vectorized derivative computation. These designs enable any PDE-encoding multimodal foundation model to be trained or adapted with unified physics-informed objectives across equation families. On a benchmark of 13 parametric one-dimensional time-dependent PDE families, PI-MFM consistently outperforms purely data-driven counterparts, especially with sparse labeled spatiotemporal points, partially observed time domains, or few labeled function pairs. Physics losses further improve robustness against noise, and simple strategies such as resampling collocation points substantially improve accuracy. We also analyze the accuracy, precision, and computational cost of automatic differentiation and finite differences for derivative computation within PI-MFM. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot physics-informed fine-tuning to unseen PDE families: starting from a physics-informed pretrained model, adapting using only PDE residuals and initial/boundary conditions, without any labeled solution data, rapidly reduces test errors to around 1% and clearly outperforms physics-only training from scratch. These results show that PI-MFM provides a practical and scalable path toward data-efficient, transferable PDE solvers.</p></details> |  |

This survey examines robot manipulation from an algorithmic perspective and organizes recent learning-based approaches within a unified abstraction of high-level planning and low-level control. At the high level, we extend the classical notion of task planning to include reasoning over language, code, motion, affordances, and 3D representations, emphasizing their role in structured and long-horizon decision making. At the low level, we propose a training-paradigm-oriented taxonomy for learning-based control, organizing existing methods along input modeling, latent representation learning, and policy learning.

A key limitation of existing approaches like Ultra is their reliance on a single relational transformation (e.g., element-wise multiplication) in message passing, which can constrain expressiveness and fail to capture diverse relational and structural patterns exhibited on diverse graphs. In this paper, we propose Gamma, a novel foundation model that introduces multi-head geometric attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern. We present a full formalization of these algebraic message functions and discuss how their combination increases expressiveness beyond any single space. Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs demonstrate that Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction, with a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on the inductive benchmarks and a 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks, highlighting benefits from complementary geometric representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE TPAMI, under review</p></details> |
| **[Agentic AI for Cyber Resilience: A New Security Paradigm and Its System-Theoretic Foundations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22883v1)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cybersecurity is being fundamentally reshaped by foundation-model-based artificial intelligence. Large language models now enable autonomous planning, tool orchestration, and strategic adaptation at scale, challenging security architectures built on static rules, perimeter defenses, and human-centered workflows. This chapter argues for a shift from prevention-centric security toward agentic cyber resilience. Rather than seeking perfect protection, resilient systems must anticipate disruption, maintain critical functions under attack, recover efficiently, and learn continuously. We situate this shift within the historical evolution of cybersecurity paradigms, culminating in an AI-augmented paradigm where autonomous agents participate directly in sensing, reasoning, action, and adaptation across cyber and cyber-physical systems. We then develop a system-level framework for designing agentic AI workflows. A general agentic architecture is introduced, and attacker and defender workflows are analyzed as coupled adaptive processes, and game-theoretic formulations are shown to provide a unifying design language for autonomy allocation, information flow, and temporal composition. Case studies in automated penetration testing, remediation, and cyber deception illustrate how equilibrium-based design enables system-level resiliency design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing Foundation Vision Models: Adaptive Transfer for Diverse Data-Limited Scientific Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22664v1)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the big data era, the computer vision field benefits from large-scale datasets such as LAION-2B, LAION-400M, and ImageNet-21K, Kinetics, on which popular models like the ViT and ConvNeXt series have been pre-trained, acquiring substantial knowledge. However, numerous downstream tasks in specialized and data-limited scientific domains continue to pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Cluster Attention Adapter (CLAdapter), which refines and adapts the rich representations learned from large-scale data to various data-limited downstream tasks. Specifically, CLAdapter introduces attention mechanisms and cluster centers to personalize the enhancement of transformed features through distribution correlation and transformation matrices. This enables models fine-tuned with CLAdapter to learn distinct representations tailored to different feature sets, facilitating the models' adaptation from rich pre-trained features to various downstream scenarios effectively. In addition, CLAdapter's unified interface design allows for seamless integration with multiple model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers, in both 2D and 3D contexts. Through extensive experiments on 10 datasets spanning domains such as generic, multimedia, biological, medical, industrial, agricultural, environmental, geographical, materials science, out-of-distribution (OOD), and 3D analysis, CLAdapter achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse data-limited scientific domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in unleashing the potential of foundation vision models via adaptive transfer.

Using Inductive Bias to Probe for World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06952v4)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are premised on the idea that sequence prediction can uncover deeper domain understanding, much like how Kepler's predictions of planetary motion later led to the discovery of Newtonian mechanics. However, evaluating whether these models truly capture deeper structure remains a challenge. We develop a technique for evaluating foundation models that examines how they adapt to synthetic datasets generated from some postulated world model. Our technique measures whether the foundation model's inductive bias aligns with the world model, and so we refer to it as an inductive bias probe. Across multiple domains, we find that foundation models can excel at their training tasks yet fail to develop inductive biases towards the underlying world model when adapted to new tasks. We particularly find that foundation models trained on orbital trajectories consistently fail to apply Newtonian mechanics when adapted to new physics tasks. Further analysis reveals that these models behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail to generalize.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICML 2025</p></details> |

Recently, the emergence of the powerful visual foundation model, DINOv2, trained in a self-supervised manner on massive datasets, has significantly improved VPR performance. This improvement stems from DINOv2's exceptional feature generalization capabilities but is often accompanied by increased model complexity and computational overhead that impede deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address this challenge, we propose $D^{2}$-VPR, a $D$istillation- and $D$eformable-based framework that retains the strong feature extraction capabilities of visual foundation models while significantly reducing model parameters and achieving a more favorable performance-efficiency trade-off. Specifically, first, we employ a two-stage training strategy that integrates knowledge distillation and fine-tuning. Additionally, we introduce a Distillation Recovery Module (DRM) to better align the feature spaces between the teacher and student models, thereby minimizing knowledge transfer losses to the greatest extent possible. Second, we design a Top-Down-attention-based Deformable Aggregator (TDDA) that leverages global semantic features to dynamically and adaptively adjust the Regions of Interest (ROI) used for aggregation, thereby improving adaptability to irregular structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Meanwhile, it reduces the parameter count by approximately 64.2% (compared to CricaVPR).Code is available at https://github.com/tony19980810/D2VPR.</p></details> |  |

RETFound is a well-known foundation model developed for fundus camera and optical coherence tomography images, which has shown promising performance in disease diagnosis. Methods: We propose FunduSegmenter, a model integrating a series of novel modules with RETFound, including a Pre-adapter, a Decoder, a Post-adapter, skip connections with Convolutional Block Attention Module and a Vision Transformer block adapter. The model is evaluated on a private dataset, GoDARTS, and four public datasets, IDRiD, Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE, through internal verification, external verification and domain generalization experiments. Results: An average Dice similarity coefficient of 90.51% was achieved in internal verification, which substantially outperformed the baselines (nnU-Net: 82.91%; DUNet: 89.17%; TransUNet: 87.91%). In all external verification experiments, the average results were about 3% higher than those of the best baseline, and were also competitive in domain generalization. Conclusions: This study explored the potential of the latent general representations learned by RETFound for OD and OC segmentation in fundus camera images. Our FunduSegmenter outperformed nearly all state-of-the-art baseline methods. The proposed modules are general and can be extended to fine-tuning other foundation models. Translational Relevance: The model shows strong stability and generalization on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, providing stable OD and OC segmentation. This is an essential step for many automated tasks, from setting the accurate retinal coordinate to biomarker discovery.

| **[A Review of Diffusion-based Simulation-Based Inference: Foundations and Applications in Non-Ideal Data Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23748v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For complex simulation problems, inferring parameters of scientific interest often precludes the use of classical likelihood-based techniques due to intractable likelihood functions. Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods forego the need for explicit likelihoods by directly utilizing samples from the simulator to learn posterior distributions over parameters $\mathbfθ$ given observed data $\mathbf{x}_{\text{o}}$. Recent work has brought attention to diffusion models -- a type of generative model rooted in score matching and reverse-time stochastic dynamics -- as a flexible framework SBI tasks. This article reviews diffusion-based SBI from first principles to applications in practice. We first recall the mathematical foundations of diffusion modeling (forward noising, reverse-time SDE/ODE, probability flow, and denoising score matching) and explain how conditional scores enable likelihood-free posterior sampling. We then examine where diffusion models address pain points of normalizing flows in neural posterior/likelihood estimation and where they introduce new trade-offs (e.g., iterative sampling costs). The key theme of this review is robustness of diffusion-based SBI in non-ideal conditions common to scientific data: misspecification (mismatch between simulated training data and reality), unstructured or infinite-dimensional observations, and missingness. We synthesize methods spanning foundations drawing from Schrodinger-bridge formulations, conditional and sequential posterior samplers, amortized architectures for unstructured data, and inference-time prior adaptation. Throughout, we adopt consistent notation and emphasize conditions and caveats required for accurate posteriors. The review closes with a discussion of open problems with an eye toward applications of uncertainty quantification for probabilistic geophysical models that may benefit from diffusion-based SBI.</p></details> |  |

Bridging this gap is essential to link neural activity with semantic cognition and to develop cross-modal brain representations. To this end, we present fMRI-LM, a foundational model that bridges functional MRI (fMRI) and language through a three-stage framework. In Stage 1, we learn a neural tokenizer that maps fMRI into discrete tokens embedded in a language-consistent space. In Stage 2, a pretrained LLM is adapted to jointly model fMRI tokens and text, treating brain activity as a sequence that can be temporally predicted and linguistically described. To overcome the lack of natural fMRI-text pairs, we construct a large descriptive corpus that translates diverse imaging-based features into structured textual descriptors, capturing the low-level organization of fMRI signals. In Stage 3, we perform multi-task, multi-paradigm instruction tuning to endow fMRI-LM with high-level semantic understanding, supporting diverse downstream applications. Across various benchmarks, fMRI-LM achieves strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, and adapts efficiently with parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA), establishing a scalable pathway toward a language-aligned, universal model for structural and semantic understanding of fMRI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code are available: https://github.com/yuxiangwei0808/fMRI-LM</p></details> |

Motivated by this vision, we present MAI-UI, a family of foundation GUI agents spanning the full spectrum of sizes, including 2B, 8B, 32B, and 235B-A22B variants. We identify four key challenges to realistic deployment: the lack of native agent-user interaction, the limits of UI-only operation, the absence of a practical deployment architecture, and brittleness in dynamic environments. MAI-UI addresses these issues with a unified methodology: a self-evolving data pipeline that expands the navigation data to include user interaction and MCP tool calls, a native device-cloud collaboration system routes execution by task state, and an online RL framework with advanced optimizations to scale parallel environments and context length. MAI-UI establishes new state-of-the-art across GUI grounding and mobile navigation. On grounding benchmarks, it reaches 73.5% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 91.3% on MMBench GUI L2, 70.9% on OSWorld-G, and 49.2% on UI-Vision, surpassing Gemini-3-Pro and Seed1.8 on ScreenSpot-Pro. On mobile GUI navigation, it sets a new SOTA of 76.7% on AndroidWorld, surpassing UI-Tars-2, Gemini-2.5-Pro and Seed1.8. On MobileWorld, MAI-UI obtains 41.7% success rate, significantly outperforming end-to-end GUI models and competitive with Gemini-3-Pro based agentic frameworks. Our online RL experiments show significant gains from scaling parallel environments from 32 to 512 (+5.2 points) and increasing environment step budget from 15 to 50 (+4.3 points). Finally, the native device-cloud collaboration system improves on-device performance by 33%, reduces cloud model calls by over 40%, and preserves user privacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Backdoor Attacks on Prompt-Driven Video Segmentation Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22046v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt-driven Video Segmentation Foundation Models (VSFMs) such as SAM2 are increasingly deployed in applications like autonomous driving and digital pathology, raising concerns about backdoor threats. Surprisingly, we find that directly transferring classic backdoor attacks (e.g., BadNet) to VSFMs is almost ineffective, with ASR below 5\%. To understand this, we study encoder gradients and attention maps and observe that conventional training keeps gradients for clean and triggered samples largely aligned, while attention still focuses on the true object, preventing the encoder from learning a distinct trigger-related representation. To address this challenge, we propose BadVSFM, the first backdoor framework tailored to prompt-driven VSFMs. BadVSFM uses a two-stage strategy: (1) steer the image encoder so triggered frames map to a designated target embedding while clean frames remain aligned with a clean reference encoder; (2) train the mask decoder so that, across prompt types, triggered frame-prompt pairs produce a shared target mask, while clean outputs stay close to a reference decoder. Extensive experiments on two datasets and five VSFMs show that BadVSFM achieves strong, controllable backdoor effects under diverse triggers and prompts while preserving clean segmentation quality. Ablations over losses, stages, targets, trigger settings, and poisoning rates demonstrate robustness to reasonable hyperparameter changes and confirm the necessity of the two-stage design. Finally, gradient-conflict analysis and attention visualizations show that BadVSFM separates triggered and clean representations and shifts attention to trigger regions, while four representative defenses remain largely ineffective, revealing an underexplored vulnerability in current VSFMs.</p></details> |  |

Atlas-based methods aggregate voxel signals into fixed regions of interest, reducing data dimensionality but discarding fine-grained spatial details, and requiring extremely large cohorts to train effectively as general-purpose foundation models. Atlas-free methods, on the other hand, operate directly on voxel-level information - preserving spatial fidelity but are prohibitively memory- and compute-intensive, making large-scale pre-training infeasible. We introduce SLIM-Brain (Sample-efficient, Low-memory fMRI Foundation Model for Human Brain), a new atlas-free foundation model that simultaneously improves both data- and training-efficiency. SLIM-Brain adopts a two-stage adaptive design: (i) a lightweight temporal extractor captures global context across full sequences and ranks data windows by saliency, and (ii) a 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from the top-$k$ selected windows, while deleting about 70% masked patches. Extensive experiments across seven public benchmarks show that SLIM-Brain establishes new state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks, while requiring only 4 thousand pre-training sessions and approximately 30% of GPU memory comparing to traditional voxel-level methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code will be released after review</p></details> |

Modern socio-technical systems are characterized by strategic coopetition in which actors concomitantly cooperate to create value and compete to capture it. While conceptual modeling languages such as i* provide rich qualitative representations of strategic dependencies, they lack mechanisms for quantitative analysis of dynamic trade-offs. Conversely, classical game theory offers mathematical rigor but strips away contextual richness. This technical report bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize two critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity. We ground interdependence in i* structural dependency analysis, translating depender-dependee-dependum relationships into quantitative interdependence coefficients through a structured translation framework. We formalize complementarity following Brandenburger and Nalebuff's Added Value concept, modeling synergistic value creation with validated parameterization. We integrate structural dependencies with bargaining power in value appropriation and introduce a game-theoretic formulation where Nash Equilibrium incorporates structural interdependence. Validation combines comprehensive experimental testing comprising over 22,000 trials across power and logarithmic value function specifications, demonstrating functional form robustness, with empirical application to the Samsung-Sony S-LCD joint venture (2004-2011).

Despite decades of advancements, its widespread clinical adoption remains constrained by prolonged scan times and heterogeneity across medical environments. This underscores the urgent need for a generalist reconstruction foundation model for ultra-fast CMR imaging, one capable of adapting across diverse imaging scenarios and serving as the essential substrate for all downstream analyses. To enable this goal, we curate MMCMR-427K, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal CMR k-space database to date, comprising 427,465 multi-coil k-space data paired with structured metadata across 13 international centers, 12 CMR modalities, 15 scanners, and 17 CVD categories in populations across three continents. Building on this unprecedented resource, we introduce CardioMM, a generalist reconstruction foundation model capable of dynamically adapting to heterogeneous fast CMR imaging scenarios. CardioMM unifies semantic contextual understanding with physics-informed data consistency to deliver robust reconstructions across varied scanners, protocols, and patient presentations. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that CardioMM achieves state-of-the-art performance in the internal centers and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to unseen external settings. Even at imaging acceleration up to 24x, CardioMM reliably preserves key cardiac phenotypes, quantitative myocardial biomarkers, and diagnostic image quality, enabling a substantial increase in CMR examination throughput without compromising clinical integrity. Together, our open-access MMCMR-427K database and CardioMM framework establish a scalable pathway toward high-throughput, high-quality, and clinically accessible cardiovascular imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github: https://github.com/wangziblake/CardioMM_MMCMR-427K</p></details> |

Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular parameter-efficient method for adapting pre-trained TSFMs to downstream data domains. However, it still underperforms in financial data, as it preserves the network architecture and training objective of TSFMs rather than complementing the foundation model. To further enhance TSFMs, we propose a novel refinement module, RefineBridge, built upon a tractable Schrödinger Bridge (SB) generative framework. Given the forecasts of TSFM as generative prior and the observed ground truths as targets, RefineBridge learns context-conditioned stochastic transport maps to improve TSFM predictions, iteratively approaching the ground-truth target from even a low-quality prior. Simulations on multiple financial benchmarks demonstrate that RefineBridge consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art TSFMs across different prediction horizons.</p></details> |  |

Building on Shannon's entropy, rate'--distortion theory, and Wyner'--Ziv coding, we show that all optimization methods can be interpreted as projections of continuous information onto discrete binary spaces. Numbers are not intrinsic carriers of meaning but codes of information, with binary digits (0 and 1) serving as universal symbols sufficient for all mathematical structures. Rate'--distortion optimization via Lagrangian multipliers connects quantization error directly to fundamental limits of representation, while Wyner'--Ziv coding admits a path integral interpretation over probability manifolds, unifying quantization, inference, geometry, and error. We further extend this framework into category theory, topological data analysis, and universal coding, situating computation and game theory as complementary perspectives.

| **[Foundation Model Priors Enhance Object Focus in Feature Space for Source-Free Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17514v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current state-of-the-art approaches in Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) typically rely on Mean-Teacher self-labeling. However, domain shift often reduces the detector's ability to maintain strong object-focused representations, causing high-confidence activations over background clutter. This weak object focus results in unreliable pseudo-labels from the detection head. While prior works mainly refine these pseudo-labels, they overlook the underlying need to strengthen the feature space itself. We propose FALCON-SFOD (Foundation-Aligned Learning with Clutter suppression and Noise robustness), a framework designed to enhance object-focused adaptation under domain shift. It consists of two complementary components. SPAR (Spatial Prior-Aware Regularization) leverages the generalization strength of vision foundation models to regularize the detector's feature space. Using class-agnostic binary masks derived from OV-SAM, SPAR promotes structured and foreground-focused activations by guiding the network toward object regions. IRPL (Imbalance-aware Noise Robust Pseudo-Labeling) complements SPAR by promoting balanced and noise-tolerant learning under severe foreground-background imbalance. Guided by a theoretical analysis that connects these designs to tighter localization and classification error bounds, FALCON-SFOD achieves competitive performance across SFOD benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[EEG Foundation Models: A Critical Review of Current Progress and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11783v3)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Premise. Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubrics for long-term research progress remain unclear. Objective. In this work, we conduct a review of ten early EEG-FMs to capture common trends and identify key directions for future development of EEG-FMs. Methods. We comparatively analyze each EEG-FM using three fundamental pillars of foundation modeling, namely the representation of input data, self-supervised modeling, and the evaluation strategy. Based on this analysis, we present a critical synthesis of EEG-FM methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. Results. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked temporal EEG sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. Significance. Our review indicates that the development of benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages (main), 5 figures (main), 4 tables (main + supplement)</p></details> |
| **[Foundation Model-based Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders: A Lifespan-Inclusive, Multi-Modal, and Multi-Lingual Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20948v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are characterized by linguistic and acoustic abnormalities, offering potential biomarkers for early detection. Despite the promise of multi-modal approaches, challenges like multi-lingual generalization and the absence of a unified evaluation framework persist. To address these gaps, we propose FEND (Foundation model-based Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders), a comprehensive multi-modal framework integrating speech and text modalities for detecting AD, depression, and ASD across the lifespan. Leveraging 13 multi-lingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, Greek, French, and Dutch, we systematically evaluate multi-modal fusion performance. Our results show that multi-modal fusion excels in AD and depression detection but underperforms in ASD due to dataset heterogeneity. We also identify modality imbalance as a prevalent issue, where multi-modal fusion fails to surpass the best mono-modal models. Cross-corpus experiments reveal robust performance in task- and language-consistent scenarios but noticeable degradation in multi-lingual and task-heterogeneous settings. By providing extensive benchmarks and a detailed analysis of performance-influencing factors, FEND advances the field of automated, lifespan-inclusive, and multi-lingual neuropsychiatric disorder assessment. We encourage researchers to adopt the FEND framework for fair comparisons and reproducible research.</p></details> |  |

Offloading tasks to remote edge servers introduces high latency, creating an inherent trade-off in system design. To address these limitations, we propose CoDrone - the first cloud-edge-end collaborative computing framework integrating foundation models into autonomous UAV cruising scenarios - effectively leveraging foundation models to enhance performance of resource-constrained unmanned aerial vehicle platforms. To reduce onboard computation and data transmission overhead, CoDrone employs grayscale imagery for the navigation model. When enhanced environmental perception is required, CoDrone leverages the edge-assisted foundation model Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and introduces a novel one-dimensional occupancy grid-based navigation method - enabling fine-grained scene understanding while advancing efficiency and representational simplicity of autonomous navigation. A key component of CoDrone is a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based neural scheduler that seamlessly integrates depth estimation with autonomous navigation decisions, enabling real-time adaptation to dynamic environments. Furthermore, the framework introduces a UAV-specific vision language interaction module incorporating domain-tailored low-level flight primitives to enable effective interaction between the cloud foundation model and the UAV. The introduction of VLM enhances open-set reasoning capabilities in complex unseen scenarios. Experimental results show CoDrone outperforms baseline methods under varying flight speeds and network conditions, achieving a 40% increase in average flight distance and a 5% improvement in average Quality of Navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by the IEEE Internet of Things Journal (IoT-J) for publication in the Special Issue on "Augmented Edge Sensing Intelligence for Low-Altitude IoT Systems"</p></details> |
| **[Memory-Efficient Acceleration of Block Low-Rank Foundation Models on Resource Constrained GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20861v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in transformer-based foundation models have made them the default choice for many tasks, but their rapidly growing size makes fitting a full model on a single GPU increasingly difficult and their computational cost prohibitive. Block low-rank (BLR) compression techniques address this challenge by learning compact representations of weight matrices. While traditional low-rank (LR) methods often incur sharp accuracy drops, BLR approaches such as Monarch and BLAST can better capture the underlying structure, thus preserving accuracy while reducing computations and memory footprints. In this work, we use roofline analysis to show that, although BLR methods achieve theoretical savings and practical speedups for single-token inference, multi-token inference often becomes memory-bound in practice, increasing latency despite compiler-level optimizations in PyTorch. To address this, we introduce custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations for both Monarch and BLAST. On memory-constrained NVIDIA GPUs such as Jetson Orin Nano and A40, our kernels deliver up to $3.76\times$ speedups and $3\times$ model size compression over PyTorch dense baselines using CUDA backend and compiler-level optimizations, while supporting various models including Llama-7/1B, GPT2-S, DiT-XL/2, and ViT-B.

In this work, we present Seedance 1.5 pro, a foundational model engineered specifically for native, joint audio-video generation. Leveraging a dual-branch Diffusion Transformer architecture, the model integrates a cross-modal joint module with a specialized multi-stage data pipeline, achieving exceptional audio-visual synchronization and superior generation quality.

| **[Foundation Model for Polycrystalline Material Informatics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06770v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a three-dimensional foundation model for polycrystalline materials based on a masked autoencoder trained via large-scale self-supervised learning. The model is pretrained on $100{,}000$ voxelized synthetic face-centered cubic (FCC) microstructures whose crystallographic textures systematically span the texture hull using hierarchical simplex sampling. The transferability of the learned latent representations is evaluated on two downstream tasks: homogenized elastic stiffness prediction and nonlinear stress-strain response prediction. For the nonlinear task, the pretrained encoder is coupled with an orientation-aware interaction-based deep material network (ODMN), where latent features are used to infer microstructure-dependent surrogate parameters. The inferred ODMNs are subsequently combined with crystal plasticity to predict stress--strain responses for previously unseen microstructures. In stiffness prediction, the pretrained model achieves validation $R^2$ values exceeding 0.8, compared to below 0.1 for non-pretrained baselines. In nonlinear response prediction, mean stress errors remain below 4\%. These results demonstrate that self-supervised pretraining yields physically meaningful and transferable microstructural representations, providing a scalable framework for microstructure-property inference in polycrystalline materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[IndicDLP: A Foundational Dataset for Multi-Lingual and Multi-Domain Document Layout Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20236v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document layout analysis is essential for downstream tasks such as information retrieval, extraction, OCR, and digitization. However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization. This work bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICDAR 2025 (Oral Presentation) - Best Student Paper Runner-Up Award</p></details> |

Recent advances in this area adopt centralized post-training approaches that build upon black-box foundation language models where there is no access to model weights and architecture details. Although the use of black-box models has been successful in centralized post-training, their blind replication in FL raises several concerns. Our position is that using black-box models in FL contradicts the core principles of federation such as data privacy and autonomy. In this position paper, we critically analyze the usage of black-box models in federated post-training, and provide a detailed account of various aspects of openness and their implications for FL.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we systematically study multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models and identify key factors that enable training at lower computational cost. We introduce Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models (AMoE), which distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student. We show that (1) our Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserves the geometric properties of each teacher while enabling effective knowledge transfer, (2) token-balanced batching that packs varying-resolution images into sequences with uniform token budgets stabilizes representation learning across resolutions without sacrificing performance, and (3) hierarchical clustering and sampling of training data--typically reserved for self-supervised learning--substantially improves sample efficiency over random sampling for multi-teacher distillation. By combining these findings, we curate OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus that demonstrates superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. Instantiated in a Mixture-of-Experts. We release OpenLVD200M and distilled models.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

Researchers have effectively employed the ``pre-train, prompt, and predict'' paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Through detailed analysis of memorization patterns, we observe that RetroPrompt effectively reduces the reliance on rote memorization, leading to enhanced generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing</p></details> |

Although machine learning methods have shown encouraging results, progress is hindered by data scarcity and heterogeneity arising from diverse aging conditions. In other fields, foundation models (FMs) trained on diverse datasets have achieved broad generalization through transfer learning, but no FMs have been reported for battery cycle life prediction yet. Here we present the Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT), the first FM for battery life prediction, developed through domain-knowledge-encoded mixture-of-expert layers. Validated on the largest public battery life database, PBT learns transferable representations from 13 lithium-ion battery datasets, outperforming existing models by an average of 19.8%. With transfer learning, PBT achieves state-of-the-art performance across 15 diverse datasets encompassing various operating conditions, formation protocols, and chemistries.

After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks. Our findings, together with the 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs, provide valuable observations for building scalable 3D models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://vidfm-3d-probe.github.io</p></details> |

Establishing Baselines for Foundation Models in Educational Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19903v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in educational technologies for a variety of tasks, from generating instructional materials and assisting with assessment design to tutoring. While prior work has investigated how models can be adapted or optimized for specific tasks, far less is known about how well LLMs perform at interpreting authentic educational scenarios without significant customization. As LLM-based systems become widely adopted by learners and educators in everyday academic contexts, understanding their out-of-the-box capabilities is increasingly important for setting expectations and benchmarking. We compared six LLMs to estimate their baseline performance on a simple but important task: classifying instructional moves in authentic classroom transcripts. We evaluated typical prompting methods: zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting. We found that while zero-shot performance was moderate, providing comprehensive examples (few-shot prompting) significantly improved performance for state-of-the-art models, with the strongest configuration reaching Cohen's Kappa = 0.58 against expert-coded annotations. At the same time, improvements were neither uniform nor complete: performance varied considerably by instructional move, and higher recall frequently came at the cost of increased false positives. Overall, these findings indicate that foundation models demonstrate meaningful yet limited capacity to interpret instructional discourse, with prompt design helping to surface capability but not eliminating fundamental reliability constraints.</p></details> |  |

Their derivatives compute representations of types of one-hole contexts, useful for implementing tree-traversal algorithms. In the category of containers and cartesian morphisms, derivatives of discrete containers (whose positions have decidable equality) satisfy a universal property. Working in Univalent Foundations, we extend the derivative operation to untruncated containers (whose shapes and positions are arbitrary types). We prove that this derivative, defined in terms of a set of isolated positions, satisfies an appropriate universal property in the wild category of untruncated containers and cartesian morphisms, as well as basic laws with respect to constants, sums and products. A chain rule exists, but is in general non-invertible. In fact, a globally invertible chain rule is inconsistent in the presence of non-set types, and equivalent to a classical principle when restricted to set-truncated containers. We derive a rule for derivatives of smallest fixed points from the chain rule, and characterize its invertibility. All of our results are formalized in Cubical Agda.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fix a...</summary><p>Fix an unfortunate copy-and-paste typo</p></details> |

However, the interdisciplinary, fragmented, and fast-evolving expertise in this domain prevents general-purpose LLMs, which lack domain knowledge and physical-constraint awareness, from delivering precise engineering-aligned inference and generation. To address these challenges, we introduce Helios, a large language model tailored to the smart energy domain, together with a comprehensive suite of resources to advance LLM research in this field. Specifically, we develop Enersys, a multi-agent collaborative framework for end-to-end dataset construction, through which we produce: (1) a smart energy knowledge base, EnerBase, to enrich the model's foundational expertise; (2) an instruction fine-tuning dataset, EnerInstruct, to strengthen performance on domain-specific downstream tasks; and (3) an RLHF dataset, EnerReinforce, to align the model with human preferences and industry standards. Leveraging these resources, Helios undergoes large-scale pretraining, SFT, and RLHF. We also release EnerBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in smart energy scenarios, and demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances domain knowledge mastery, task execution accuracy, and alignment with human preferences.</p></details> |  |

Surprisingly, even after fine-tuning, TSFMs cannot consistently outperform smaller, specialized models trained on full-shot downstream data. A key question is how to realize effective adaptation of TSFMs for a target forecasting task. Through empirical studies on various TSFMs, the pre-trained models often exhibit inherent sparsity and redundancy in computation, suggesting that TSFMs have learned to activate task-relevant network substructures to accommodate diverse forecasting tasks. To preserve this valuable prior knowledge, we propose a structured pruning method to regularize the subsequent fine-tuning process by focusing it on a more relevant and compact parameter space. Extensive experiments on seven TSFMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning a smaller, pruned TSFM significantly improves forecasting performance compared to fine-tuning original models. This prune-then-finetune paradigm often enables TSFMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance and surpass strong specialized baselines.

Existing tools such as PTM and CNA are restricted to a small set of hand-crafted lattices (e.g.\ FCC/BCC/HCP), degrade under strong thermal disorder or defects, and produce hard, template-based labels without per-atom probability or confidence scores. Here we introduce a log-probability foundation model that unifies denoising, phase classification, and OP extraction within a single probabilistic framework. We reuse the MACE-MP foundation interatomic potential on crystal structures mapped to AFLOW prototypes, training it to predict per-atom, per-phase logits $l$ and to aggregate them into a global log-density $\log \hat{P}_θ(\boldsymbol{r})$ whose gradient defines a conservative score field. Denoising corresponds to gradient ascent on this learned log-density, phase labels follow from $\arg\max_c l_{ac}$, and the $l$ values act as continuous, defect-sensitive and interpretable OPs quantifying the Euclidean distance to ideal phases. We demonstrate universality across hundreds of prototypes, robustness under strong thermal and defect-induced disorder, and accurate treatment of complex systems such as ice polymorphs, ice--water interfaces, and shock-compressed Ti.</p></details> |  |

Recent research explores and demonstrates the transferability of learning rate configurations across varying model and dataset sizes, etc. Nevertheless, these approaches are constrained to specific training scenarios and typically necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning on proxy models. In this work, we propose \textbf{AdaLRS}, a plug-in-and-play adaptive learning rate search algorithm that conducts online optimal learning rate search via optimizing loss descent velocities. We provide theoretical and experimental analyzes to show that foundation model pretraining loss and its descent velocity are both convex and share the same optimal learning rate. Relying solely on training loss dynamics, AdaLRS involves few extra computations to guide the search process, and its convergence is guaranteed via theoretical analysis. Experiments on both LLM and VLM pretraining show that AdaLRS adjusts suboptimal learning rates to the neighborhood of optimum with marked efficiency and effectiveness, with model performance improved accordingly. We also show the robust generalizability of AdaLRS across varying training scenarios, such as different model sizes, training paradigms, base learning rate scheduler choices, and hyperparameter settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

While recent interactive foundation models (e.g., nnInteractive) enhance generalization through large-scale multimodal pretraining, they still depend on precise prompts and often perform below expectations in contexts that are underrepresented in their training data. We present AtlasSegFM, an atlas-guided framework that customizes available foundation models to clinical contexts with a single annotated example. The core innovations are: 1) a pipeline that provides context-aware prompts for foundation models via registration between a context atlas and query images, and 2) a test-time adapter to fuse predictions from both atlas registration and the foundation model. Extensive experiments across public and in-house datasets spanning multiple modalities and organs demonstrate that AtlasSegFM consistently improves segmentation, particularly for small, delicate structures. AtlasSegFM provides a lightweight, deployable solution one-shot customization of foundation models in real-world clinical workflows. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Deep Predicate Invention with Pre-trained Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17992v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon robotic tasks are hard due to continuous state-action spaces and sparse feedback. Symbolic world models help by decomposing tasks into discrete predicates that capture object properties and relations. Existing methods learn predicates either top-down, by prompting foundation models without data grounding, or bottom-up, from demonstrations without high-level priors. We introduce UniPred, a bilevel learning framework that unifies both. UniPred uses large language models (LLMs) to propose predicate effect distributions that supervise neural predicate learning from low-level data, while learned feedback iteratively refines the LLM hypotheses. Leveraging strong visual foundation model features, UniPred learns robust predicate classifiers in cluttered scenes. We further propose a predicate evaluation method that supports symbolic models beyond STRIPS assumptions. Across five simulated and one real-robot domains, UniPred achieves 2-4 times higher success rates than top-down methods and 3-4 times faster learning than bottom-up approaches, advancing scalable and flexible symbolic world modeling for robotics.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |

However, giga-scale foundation models, which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale) across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2024 workshop in Health Intelligence Special Theme on Foundation Models and AI Agents</p></details> |

However, segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species, growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than supervised methods.

These models are typically pretrained on fixed band configurations and resolutions, making them vulnerable to real world scenarios involving missing bands, cross sensor fusion, and unseen spatial scales, thereby limiting their generalization and practical deployment. To address these limitations, we propose Any Optical Model (AOM), a universal RSFM explicitly designed to accommodate arbitrary band compositions, sensor types, and resolution scales. To preserve distinctive spectral characteristics even when bands are missing or newly introduced, AOM introduces a spectrum-independent tokenizer that assigns each channel a dedicated band embedding, enabling explicit encoding of spectral identity. To effectively capture texture and contextual patterns from sub-meter to hundred-meter imagery, we design a multi-scale adaptive patch embedding mechanism that dynamically modulates the receptive field. Furthermore, to maintain global semantic consistency across varying resolutions, AOM incorporates a multi-scale semantic alignment mechanism alongside a channel-wise self-supervised masking and reconstruction pretraining strategy that jointly models spectral-spatial relationships. Extensive experiments on over 10 public datasets, including those from Sentinel-2, Landsat, and HLS, demonstrate that AOM consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under challenging conditions such as band missing, cross sensor, and cross resolution settings.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2026 |
| **[Do Foundational Audio Encoders Understand Music Structure?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17209v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In music information retrieval (MIR) research, the use of pretrained foundational audio encoders (FAEs) has recently become a trend. FAEs pretrained on large amounts of music and audio data have been shown to improve performance on MIR tasks such as music tagging and automatic music transcription. However, their use for music structure analysis (MSA) remains underexplored. Although many open-source FAE models are available, only a small subset has been examined for MSA, and the impact of factors such as learning methods, training data, and model context length on MSA performance remains unclear. In this study, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 11 types of FAEs to investigate how these factors affect MSA performance. Our results demonstrate that FAEs using selfsupervised learning with masked language modeling on music data are particularly effective for MSA. These findings pave the way for future research in MSA.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Classical Machine Learning to Emerging Foundation Models: Review on Multimodal Data Integration for Cancer Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09028v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer research is increasingly driven by the integration of diverse data modalities, spanning from genomics and proteomics to imaging and clinical factors. However, extracting actionable insights from these vast and heterogeneous datasets remains a key challenge. The rise of foundation models (FMs) -- large deep-learning models pretrained on extensive amounts of data serving as a backbone for a wide range of downstream tasks -- offers new avenues for discovering biomarkers, improving diagnosis, and personalizing treatment. This paper presents a comprehensive review of widely adopted integration strategies of multimodal data to assist advance the computational approaches for data-driven discoveries in oncology. We examine emerging trends in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), including methodological frameworks, validation protocols, and open-source resources targeting cancer subtype classification, biomarker discovery, treatment guidance, and outcome prediction. This study also comprehensively covers the shift from traditional ML to FMs for multimodal integration. We present a holistic view of recent FMs advancements and challenges faced during the integration of multi-omics with advanced imaging data. We identify the state-of-the-art FMs, publicly available multi-modal repositories, and advanced tools and methods for data integration. We argue that current state-of-the-art integrative methods provide the essential groundwork for developing the next generation of large-scale, pre-trained models poised to further revolutionize oncology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review to systematically map the transition from conventional ML to advanced FM for multimodal data integration in oncology, while also framing these developments as foundational for the forthcoming era of large-scale AI models in cancer research.</p></details> | 10 figures, 5 tables |

XR-0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on most multi-anatomy tasks and remains competitive on chest-specific benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that anatomical diversity and supervision are critical for building robust, general-purpose medical vision models, paving the way for scalable and adaptable AI systems in radiology.</p></details> |  |

We explore a data-in-the-loop paradigm from the view of both data construction and framework design. We collect a large-scale dataset by combining public datasets, high-quality synthetic data from our UE5 simulator and text-to-image models, and real panoramic images from the web. To reduce domain gaps between indoor/outdoor and synthetic/real data, we introduce a three-stage pseudo-label curation pipeline to generate reliable ground truth for unlabeled images. For the model, we adopt DINOv3-Large as the backbone for its strong pre-trained generalization, and introduce a plug-and-play range mask head, sharpness-centric optimization, and geometry-centric optimization to improve robustness to varying distances and enforce geometric consistency across views. Experiments on multiple benchmarks (e.g., Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D, and Deep360) demonstrate strong performance and zero-shot generalization, with particularly robust and stable metric predictions in diverse real-world scenes.

The multi-camera setup introduces substantial redundancy and irrelevant information, which increases computational costs and forces the model to spend extra training time extracting crucial task-relevant details. To filter out redundant information and accurately extract task-relevant features, we propose the VERM (Virtual Eye for Robotic Manipulation) method, leveraging the knowledge in foundation models to imagine a virtual task-adaptive view from the constructed 3D point cloud, which efficiently captures necessary information and mitigates occlusion. To facilitate 3D action planning and fine-grained manipulation, we further design a depth-aware module and a dynamic coarse-to-fine procedure. Extensive experimental results on both simulation benchmark RLBench and real-world evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods while achieving 1.89x speedup in training time and 1.54x speedup in inference speed.

This unlocks the possibility to simulate much larger length and time scales. However, benchmarks for these MLIPs are usually limited to ordered, crystalline and bulk materials. Hence, reported performance does not necessarily accurately reflect MLIP performance in real applications such as heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we systematically analyze zero-shot performance of 80 different MLIPs, evaluating tasks typical for heterogeneous catalysis across a range of different data sets, including adsorption and reaction on surfaces of alloyed metals, oxides, and metal-oxide interfacial systems. We demonstrate that current-generation foundational MLIPs can already perform at high accuracy for applications such as predicting vacancy formation energies of perovskite oxides or zero-point energies of supported nanoclusters. However, limitations also exist. We find that many MLIPs catastrophically fail when applied to magnetic materials, and structure relaxation in the MLIP generally increases the energy prediction error compared to single-point evaluation of a previously optimized structure. Comparing low-cost task-specific models to foundational MLIPs, we highlight some core differences between these model approaches and show that -- if considering only accuracy -- these models can compete with the current generation of best-performing MLIPs. Furthermore, we show that no single MLIP universally performs best, requiring users to investigate MLIP suitability for their desired application.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 1 table + supplementary information (37 pages, 16 figures, 15 tables)</p></details> |
| **[Causal-Tune: Mining Causal Factors from Vision Foundation Models for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16567v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with a small number of parameters has shown remarkable performance in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS). Most existing works either train lightweight adapters or refine intermediate features to achieve better generalization on unseen domains. However, they both overlook the fact that long-term pre-trained VFMs often exhibit artifacts, which hinder the utilization of valuable representations and ultimately degrade DGSS performance. Inspired by causal mechanisms, we observe that these artifacts are associated with non-causal factors, which usually reside in the low- and high-frequency components of the VFM spectrum. In this paper, we explicitly examine the causal and non-causal factors of features within VFMs for DGSS, and propose a simple yet effective method to identify and disentangle them, enabling more robust domain generalization. Specifically, we propose Causal-Tune, a novel fine-tuning strategy designed to extract causal factors and suppress non-causal ones from the features of VFMs. First, we extract the frequency spectrum of features from each layer using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). A Gaussian band-pass filter is then applied to separate the spectrum into causal and non-causal components. To further refine the causal components, we introduce a set of causal-aware learnable tokens that operate in the frequency domain, while the non-causal components are discarded. Finally, refined features are transformed back into the spatial domain via inverse DCT and passed to the next layer. Extensive experiments conducted on various cross-domain tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Causal-Tune. In particular, our method achieves superior performance under adverse weather conditions, improving +4.8% mIoU over the baseline in snow conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Alternatively, foundation models with rich knowledge have recently shown their generalization power. However, how to apply such knowledge has not been fully explored for open-world video recognition. To this end, we propose a generic knowledge transfer pipeline, which progressively exploits and integrates external multimodal knowledge from foundation models to boost open-world video recognition. We name it PCA, based on three stages of Percept, Chat, and Adapt. First, we perform Percept process to reduce the video domain gap and obtain external visual knowledge. Second, we generate rich linguistic semantics as external textual knowledge in Chat stage. Finally, we blend external multimodal knowledge in Adapt stage, by inserting multimodal knowledge adaptation modules into networks. We conduct extensive experiments on three challenging open-world video benchmarks, i.e., TinyVIRAT, ARID, and QV-Pipe. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all three datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[LitFM: A Retrieval Augmented Structure-aware Foundation Model For Citation Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12177v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of large language models (LLMs), managing scientific literature via LLMs has become a promising direction of research. However, existing approaches often overlook the rich structural and semantic relevance among scientific literature, limiting their ability to discern the relationships between pieces of scientific knowledge, and suffer from various types of hallucinations. These methods also focus narrowly on individual downstream tasks, limiting their applicability across use cases. Here we propose LitFM, the first literature foundation model designed for a wide variety of practical downstream tasks on domain-specific literature, with a focus on citation information. At its core, LitFM contains a novel graph retriever to integrate graph structure by navigating citation graphs and extracting relevant literature, thereby enhancing model reliability. LitFM also leverages a knowledge-infused LLM, fine-tuned through a well-developed instruction paradigm. It enables LitFM to extract domain-specific knowledge from literature and reason relationships among them. By integrating citation graphs during both training and inference, LitFM can generalize to unseen papers and accurately assess their relevance within existing literature. Additionally, we introduce new large-scale literature citation benchmark datasets on three academic fields, featuring sentence-level citation information and local context. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of LitFM, achieving 28.1% improvement on retrieval task in precision, and an average improvement of 7.52% over state-of-the-art across six downstream literature-related tasks</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Conversational Time Series Foundation Models: Towards Explainable and Effective Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16022v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of time series foundation models has created a landscape where no single method achieves consistent superiority, framing the central challenge not as finding the best model, but as orchestrating an optimal ensemble with interpretability. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their direct application to time series forecasting has proven ineffective. We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models. To overcome the LLM's inherent lack of domain-specific knowledge on time series, we introduce an R1-style finetuning process, guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores, which teaches the model to interpret ensemble weights as meaningful causal statements about temporal dynamics. The trained agent then engages in iterative, multi-turn conversations to perform forward-looking assessments, provide causally-grounded explanations for its weighting decisions, and adaptively refine the optimization strategy. Validated on the GIFT-Eval benchmark on 23 datasets across 97 settings, our approach significantly outperforms leading time series foundation models on both CRPS and MASE metrics, establishing new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 31Pages |

Traditional methods often lack the scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper introduces FARM: Fine-tuning Agricultural Regression Models, a deep learning framework designed for high-resolution, intra-field canola yield prediction. FARM leverages a pre-trained, large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery into dense, pixel-level (30 m) yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from the Canadian Prairies, FARM achieves a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.44 and an R^2 of 0.81. Using an independent high-resolution yield monitor dataset, we further show that fine-tuning FARM on limited ground-truth labels outperforms training the same architecture from scratch, confirming the benefit of pre-training on large, upsampled county-level data for data-scarce precision agriculture. These results represent improvement over baseline architectures like 3D-CNN and DeepYield, which highlight the effectiveness of fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By providing a continuous, high-resolution output, FARM offers a more actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-View Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15708v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are vital tools in various Computer Vision applications. They take as input a single RGB image and output a deep feature representation that is useful for various applications. However, in case we have multiple views of the same 3D scene, they operate on each image independently and do not always produce consistent features for the same 3D point. We propose a way to convert a Foundation Model into a Multi-View Foundation Model. Such a model takes as input a set of images and outputs a feature map for each image such that the features of corresponding points are as consistent as possible. This approach bypasses the need to build a consistent 3D model of the features and allows direct manipulation in the image space. Specifically, we show how to augment Transformers-based foundation models (i.e., DINO, SAM, CLIP) with intermediate 3D-aware attention layers that help match features across different views. As leading examples, we show surface normal estimation and multi-view segmentation tasks. Quantitative experiments show that our method improves feature matching considerably compared to current foundation models.</p></details> |  |

To overcome this limitation, we leverage CUT3R, a recent Reconstructive Foundation Model (RFM), to provide reliable geometric priors from a single RGB stream. We propose MoonSeg3R, which introduces three key components: (1) a self-supervised query refinement module with spatial-semantic distillation that transforms segmentation masks from 2D visual foundation models (VFMs) into discriminative 3D queries; (2) a 3D query index memory that provides temporal consistency by retrieving contextual queries; and (3) a state-distribution token from CUT3R that acts as a mask identity descriptor to strengthen cross-frame fusion. Experiments on ScanNet200 and SceneNN show that MoonSeg3R is the first method to enable online monocular 3D segmentation and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art RGB-D-based systems.

Existing artificial intelligence-based solutions often lack robustness and fail to generalize across scenarios. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a predictive-foundation-model-based channel estimation framework that enables accurate, low-overhead, and generalizable CSI acquisition. The proposed framework employs a predictive foundation model trained on large-scale cross-domain CSI data to extract universal channel representations and provide predictive priors with strong cross-scenario transferability. A pilot processing network based on a vision transformer architecture is further designed to capture spatial, temporal, and frequency correlations from pilot observations. An efficient fusion mechanism integrates predictive priors with real-time measurements, enabling reliable CSI reconstruction even under sparse or noisy conditions. Extensive evaluations across diverse configurations demonstrate that the proposed estimator significantly outperforms both classical and data-driven baselines in accuracy, robustness, and generalization capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

In this work, we adapt the CBraMod encoder for large-scale self-supervised ECG pretraining, introducing a dual-masking strategy to capture intra- and inter-lead dependencies. To overcome the above challenges, we utilize a pre-trained CBraMod encoder for EEG and pre-train a symmetric ECG encoder, equipping each modality with a rich foundational representation. These representations are then fused via simple embedding concatenation, allowing the classification head to learn cross-modal interactions, together enabling effective downstream learning despite limited multi-modal supervision. Evaluated on emotion recognition, our approach achieves near state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that carefully designed physiological encoders, even with straightforward fusion, substantially improve downstream performance. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model approaches to harness the holistic nature of physiological signals, enabling scalable, label-efficient, and generalizable solutions for healthcare and affective computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Foundation Models for the Brain and Body</p></details> |

However, traditional ultrasound diagnostics relies heavily on physician expertise and is often hampered by suboptimal image quality, leading to potential diagnostic errors. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising solution to enhance clinical diagnosis by detecting abnormalities across various imaging modalities, existing AI methods for ultrasound face two major challenges. First, they typically require vast amounts of labeled medical data, raising serious concerns regarding patient privacy. Second, most models are designed for specific tasks, which restricts their broader clinical utility. To overcome these challenges, we present UltraFedFM, an innovative privacy-preserving ultrasound foundation model. UltraFedFM is collaboratively pre-trained using federated learning across 16 distributed medical institutions in 9 countries, leveraging a dataset of over 1 million ultrasound images covering 19 organs and 10 ultrasound modalities. This extensive and diverse data, combined with a secure training framework, enables UltraFedFM to exhibit strong generalization and diagnostic capabilities. It achieves an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.927 for disease diagnosis and a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.878 for lesion segmentation. Notably, UltraFedFM surpasses the diagnostic accuracy of mid-level ultrasonographers (4-8 years of experience) and matches the performance of expert-level sonographers (10+ years of experience) in the joint diagnosis of 8 common systemic diseases.c These findings indicate that UltraFedFM can significantly enhance clinical diagnostics while safeguarding patient privacy, marking a significant advancement in AI-driven ultrasound imaging for future clinical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>npj d...</summary><p>npj digital medicine(2025)</p></details> |

These models are designed to move beyond narrow pattern recognition towards emulating sophisticated clinical reasoning, understanding complex spatial relationships, and integrating multimodal data with unprecedented flexibility. However, a critical gap exists between this potential and the current reality, where the clinical evaluation and deployment of FMs are hampered by significant challenges. Herein, we critically assess the current state-of-the-art, analyzing hype by examining the core capabilities and limitations of FMs in the biomedical domain. We also provide a taxonomy of reasoning, ranging from emulated sequential logic and spatial understanding to the integration of explicit symbolic knowledge, to evaluate whether these models exhibit genuine cognition or merely mimic surface-level patterns. We argue that a critical frontier lies beyond statistical correlation, in the pursuit of causal inference, which is essential for building robust models that understand cause and effect. Furthermore, we discuss the paramount issues in deployment stemming from trustworthiness, bias, and safety, dissecting the challenges of algorithmic bias, data bias and privacy, and model hallucinations. We also draw attention to the need for more inclusive, rigorous, and clinically relevant validation frameworks to ensure their safe and ethical application. We conclude that while the vision of autonomous AI-doctors remains distant, the immediate reality is the emergence of powerful technology and assistive tools that would benefit clinical practice. The future of FMs in biomedical imaging hinges not on scale alone, but on developing hybrid, causally aware, and verifiably safe systems that augment, rather than replace, human expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 fig...</summary><p>5 figures and 3 tables</p></details> |

However, these models may achieve high validation accuracy by learning specimen-specific artifacts rather than generalizable biological features, limiting real-world clinical utility. We introduce PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a curated benchmark dataset derived from expert-annotated prostate biopsies designed specifically to quantify this failure mode. The benchmark comprises nine carefully selected whole slide images from nine unique patients containing diverse Gleason patterns, with non-overlapping tissue patches extracted at both 512x512 and 224x224 pixel resolutions across eight augmentation conditions. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders. Our results reveal substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 achieved the lowest slide-level encoding among large-scale models (81.0%) yet exhibited the second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder, trained specifically on prostate tissue, demonstrated the highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and the strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%), suggesting tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signatures. All models exhibited measurable within-slide vs. cross-slide accuracy gaps, though the magnitude varied from 19.9 percentage points to 26.9 percentage points. We provide an open-source Google Colab notebook enabling researchers to evaluate additional foundation models against our benchmark using standardized metrics. PANDA-PLUS-Bench addresses a critical gap in foundation model evaluation by providing a purpose-built resource for robustness assessment in the clinically important context of Gleason grading.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

This limits their ability to capture early, cross-modal disease signatures. This paper introduces a multimodal foundation model built on a transformer architecture that integrates heterogeneous clinical data through modality-specific encoders and cross-modal attention. Each modality is mapped into a shared latent space and fused using multi-head attention with residual normalization. We implement the framework using a multimodal dataset that simulates early-stage disease patterns across EHR sequences, imaging patches, genomic profiles, and wearable signals, including missing-modality scenarios and label noise. The model is trained using supervised classification together with self-supervised reconstruction and contrastive alignment to improve robustness. Experimental evaluation demonstrates strong performance in early-detection settings, with stable classification metrics, reliable uncertainty estimates, and interpretable attention patterns. The approach moves toward a flexible, pretrain-and-fine-tune foundation model that supports precision diagnostics, handles incomplete inputs, and improves early disease detection across oncology, cardiology, and neurology applications.</p></details> | 6 pages |

While recent efforts have begun to equip FMs with native single-agent abilities -- such as GUI interaction or integrated tool use -- we argue that the next frontier is endowing FMs with native multi-agent intelligence. We identify four core capabilities of FMs in multi-agent contexts: understanding, planning, efficient communication, and adaptation. Contrary to assumptions about the spontaneous emergence of such abilities, we provide extensive empirical evidence, across 41 large language models and 7 challenging benchmarks, showing that scaling single-agent performance alone does not automatically yield robust multi-agent intelligence. To address this gap, we outline key research directions -- spanning dataset construction, evaluation, training paradigms, and safety considerations -- for building FMs with native multi-agent intelligence.</p></details> |  |
