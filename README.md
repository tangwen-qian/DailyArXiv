| **[ADHDeepNet From Raw EEG to Diagnosis: Improving ADHD Diagnosis through Temporal-Spatial Processing, Adaptive Attention Mechanisms, and Explainability in Raw EEG Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08779v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in children that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and career life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients and the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls), employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy. Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner 2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation. ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 7 figures. Preprint.

| **[Unified calibration and spatial mapping of fine particulate matter data from multiple low-cost air pollution sensor networks in Baltimore, Maryland](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13034v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-cost air pollution sensor networks are increasingly being deployed globally, supplementing sparse regulatory monitoring with localized air quality data. In some areas, like Baltimore, Maryland, there are only few regulatory (reference) devices but multiple low-cost networks. While there are many available methods to calibrate data from each network individually, separate calibration of each network leads to conflicting air quality predictions. We develop a general Bayesian spatial filtering model combining data from multiple networks and reference devices, providing dynamic calibrations (informed by the latest reference data) and unified predictions (combining information from all available sensors) for the entire region. This method accounts for network-specific bias and noise (observation models), as different networks can use different types of sensors, and uses a Gaussian process (state-space model) to capture spatial correlations. We apply the method to calibrate PM$_{2.5}$ data from Baltimore in June and July 2023 -- a period including days of hazardous concentrations due to wildfire smoke. Our method helps mitigate the effects of preferential sampling of one network in Baltimore, results in better predictions and narrower confidence intervals. Our approach can be used to calibrate low-cost air pollution sensor data in Baltimore and any other areas with multiple low-cost networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MSNav: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Dynamic Memory and LLM Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16654v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM) makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities, including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module, a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition; and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space (I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp), which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL).</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Attribute-based Object Grounding and Robot Grasp Detection with Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08126v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robots to grasp objects specified through natural language is essential for effective human-robot interaction, yet it remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often struggle with open-form language expressions and typically assume unambiguous target objects without duplicates. Moreover, they frequently rely on costly, dense pixel-wise annotations for both object grounding and grasp configuration. We present Attribute-based Object Grounding and Robotic Grasping (OGRG), a novel framework that interprets open-form language expressions and performs spatial reasoning to ground target objects and predict planar grasp poses, even in scenes containing duplicated object instances. We investigate OGRG in two settings: (1) Referring Grasp Synthesis (RGS) under pixel-wise full supervision, and (2) Referring Grasp Affordance (RGA) using weakly supervised learning with only single-pixel grasp annotations. Key contributions include a bi-directional vision-language fusion module and the integration of depth information to enhance geometric reasoning, improving both grounding and grasping performance. Experiment results show that OGRG outperforms strong baselines in tabletop scenes with diverse spatial language instructions. In RGS, it operates at 17.59 FPS on a single NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti GPU, enabling potential use in closed-loop or multi-object sequential grasping, while delivering superior grounding and grasp prediction accuracy compared to all the baselines considered. Under the weakly supervised RGA setting, OGRG also surpasses baseline grasp-success rates in both simulation and real-robot trials, underscoring the effectiveness of its spatial reasoning design.

| **[MSRFormer: Road Network Representation Learning using Multi-scale Feature Fusion of Heterogeneous Spatial Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05685v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer, MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections, which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow heterogeneity of spatial interactions.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces dciWebMapper2, a significant expansion of the original dciWebMapper framework, designed to enable exploratory analysis across domains such as climate justice, food access, and social vulnerability. The enhanced framework integrates multiple map types, including choropleth, proportional symbol, small multiples, and heatmaps, with linked statistical charts (e.g., scatter plots, boxplots) and time sliders, all within a coordinated-view environment. Dropdown-based controls allow flexible, high-dimensional comparisons while maintaining visual clarity. Grounded in cartographic and information visualization principles, dciWebMapper2 is fully open-source, self-contained, and server-free, supporting modularity, reproducibility, and long-term sustainability. Three applied use cases demonstrate its adaptability and potential to democratize interactive web cartography. This work offers a versatile foundation for inclusive spatial storytelling and transparent geospatial analysis in research, education, and civic engagement.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 fi...</summary><p>15 figures, 2 tables, and three advanced interactive web map apps that are openly available to the public</p></details> |
| **[Universal Few-Shot Spatial Control for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07530v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation, we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks, achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably, when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is available at https://github.com/kietngt00/UFC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extension of Spatial k-Anonymity: New Metrics for Assessing the Anonymity of Geomasked Data Considering Realistic Attack Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07505v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial data are gaining increasing importance in many areas of research. Particularly spatial health data are becoming increasingly important for medical research, for example, to better understand relationships between environmental factors and disease patterns. However, their use is often restricted by legal data protection regulations, since georeferenced personal information carries a high risk of re-identification of individuals. To address this issue, what are called geomasking methods are applied to guarantee data protection through targeted displacement of individual data points, while simultaneously maintaining analytical validity within a tolerable range. In the current literature the degree of anonymity of such anonymized georeferenced datasets is often measured by the so-called metric of spatial k-anonymity. However, this metric has considerable shortcomings, particularly regarding its resilience against realistic data attack scenarios. This article classifies the potential data attack scenarios in the context of anonymized georeferenced microdata and introduces appropriate metrics that enable a comprehensive assessment of anonymity adapted to potential data attack scenarios.</p></details> | 16 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Bayesian inference with Besov-Laplace priors for spatially inhomogeneous binary classification surfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07439v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we study the binary classification problem with supervised data, in the case where the covariate-to-probability-of-success map is possibly spatially inhomogeneous. We devise nonparametric Bayesian procedures with Besov-Laplace priors, which are prior distributions on function spaces routinely used in imaging and inverse problems in view of their useful edge-preserving and sparsity-promoting properties. Building on a recent line of work in the literature, we investigate the theoretical asymptotic recovery properties of the associated posterior distributions, and show that suitably tuned Besov-Laplace priors lead to minimax-optimal posterior contraction rates as the sample size increases, under the frequentist assumption that the data have been generated by a spatially inhomogeneous ground truth belonging to a Besov space.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, to appear in Supervised and Unsupervised Statistical Data Analysis (CLADAG-VOC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Learning spatially structured open quantum dynamics with regional-attention transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06871v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems with spatial structure and external control is an important challenge in quantum information science. Classical numerical solvers for such systems require integrating coupled master and field equations, which is computationally demanding for simulation and optimization tasks and often precluding real-time use in network-scale simulations or feedback control. We introduce a regional attention-based neural architecture that learns the spatiotemporal dynamics of structured open quantum systems. The model incorporates translational invariance of physical laws as an inductive bias to achieve scalable complexity, and supports conditioning on time-dependent global control parameters. We demonstrate learning on two representative systems: a driven dissipative single qubit and an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) quantum memory. The model achieves high predictive fidelity under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution control protocols, and provides substantial acceleration up to three orders of magnitude over numerical solvers. These results demonstrate that the architecture establishes a general surrogate modeling framework for spatially structured open quantum dynamics, with immediate relevance to large-scale quantum network simulation, quantum repeater and protocol design, real-time experimental optimization, and scalable device modeling across diverse light-matter platforms.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Adversarial Obstacle Placement with Spatial Point Processes for Optimal Path Disruption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06837v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the Optimal Obstacle Placement (OOP) problem under uncertainty, framed as the dual of the Optimal Traversal Path problem in the Stochastic Obstacle Scene paradigm. We consider both continuous domains, discretized for analysis, and already discrete spatial grids that form weighted geospatial networks using 8-adjacency lattices. Our unified framework integrates OOP with stochastic geometry, modeling obstacle placement via Strauss (regular) and Mat\'ern (clustered) processes, and evaluates traversal using the Reset Disambiguation algorithm. Through extensive Monte Carlo experiments, we show that traversal cost increases by up to 40% under strongly regular placements, while clustered configurations can decrease traversal costs by as much as 25% by leaving navigable corridors compared to uniform random layouts. In mixed (with both true and false obstacles) scenarios, increasing the proportion of true obstacles from 30% to 70% nearly doubles the traversal cost. These findings are further supported by statistical analysis and stochastic ordering, providing rigorous insights into how spatial patterns and obstacle compositions influence navigation under uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Spatial and Semantic Embeddings for Stereo Sound Event Localization in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06598v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we address the multimodal task of stereo sound event localization and detection with source distance estimation (3D SELD) in regular video content. 3D SELD is a complex task that combines temporal event classification with spatial localization, requiring reasoning across spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. The last is arguably the most challenging to model. Traditional SELD approaches typically rely on multichannel input, limiting their capacity to benefit from large-scale pre-training due to data constraints. To overcome this, we enhance a standard SELD architecture with semantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned models: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are incorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion, which we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. We perform an ablation study on the development set of the DCASE2025 Task3 Stereo SELD Dataset to assess the individual contributions of the language-aligned models and benchmark against the DCASE Task 3 baseline systems. Additionally, we detail the curation process of large synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets used for model pre-training. These datasets were further expanded through left-right channel swapping augmentation. Our approach, combining extensive pre-training, model ensembling, and visual post-processing, achieved second rank in the DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 3 (Track B), underscoring the effectiveness of our method. Future work will explore the modality-specific contributions and architectural refinements.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2507.04845</p></details> |
| **[Spatial exponential decay of perturbations in optimal control of general evolution equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12279v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze the robustness of optimally controlled evolution equations with respect to spatially localized perturbations. We prove that if the involved operators are domain-uniformly stabilizable and detectable, then these localized perturbations only have a local effect on the optimal solution. We characterize this domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability for the transport equation with constant transport velocity, showing that even for unitary semigroups, optimality implies exponential damping. We extend this result to the case of a space-dependent transport velocity. Finally we leverage the results for the transport equation to characterize domain-uniform stabilizability of the wave equation. Numerical examples in one space dimension complement the theoretical results.</p></details> | 53 pages, 5 figures |
| **[FSG-Net: Frequency-Spatial Synergistic Gated Network for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Change Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06482v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g., illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries. To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations. Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components. Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers. Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS). 13 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[MM-Spatial: Exploring 3D Spatial Understanding in Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13111v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at 2D visual understanding but remain limited in their ability to reason about 3D space. In this work, we leverage large-scale high-quality 3D scene data with open-set annotations to introduce 1) a novel supervised fine-tuning dataset and 2) a new evaluation benchmark, focused on indoor scenes. Our Cubify Anything VQA (CA-VQA) data covers diverse spatial tasks including spatial relationship prediction, metric size and distance estimation, and 3D grounding. We show that CA-VQA enables us to train MM-Spatial, a strong generalist MLLM that also achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D spatial understanding benchmarks, including our own. We show how incorporating metric depth and multi-view inputs (provided in CA-VQA) can further improve 3D understanding, and demonstrate that data alone allows our model to achieve depth perception capabilities comparable to dedicated monocular depth estimation models.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[MCTuner: Spatial Decomposition-Enhanced Database Tuning via LLM-Guided Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06298v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Database knob tuning is essential for optimizing the performance of modern database management systems, which often expose hundreds of knobs with continuous or categorical values. However, the large number of knobs and the vast configuration space make it difficult to identify optimal settings efficiently. Although learning-based tuning has shown promise, existing approaches either ignore domain knowledge by relying solely on benchmark feedback or struggle to explore the high-dimensional knob space, resulting in high tuning costs and suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose MCTuner, an adaptive knob tuning framework that minimizes exploration in ineffective regions of the configuration space. MCTuner employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism with specialized LLMs to identify performance-critical knobs. In further, MCTuner introduces the first spatial decomposition algorithm that recursively partitions the space into hierarchical subspaces, on which Bayesian Optimization is performed to efficiently search for near-optimal configurations. Evaluated on different benchmarks (OLAP, OLTP, and HTAP), MCTuner achieves up to 19.2% performance gains and 1.4x faster configuration discovery per iteration compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reasoning with Vision-Language Models in Ego-Centric Multi-View Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06266v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data. Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view environments.</p></details> |  |

For univariate, stationary, and isotropic fields, the three controlling parameters are the process variance, smoothness, and range. The debiased Whittle likelihood maximization explicitly treats discretization and edge effects for finite sampled regions in parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. As even the best parameter estimate may not be good enough, we provide a test for whether the model specification itself warrants rejection. Our results are practical and relevant for the study of a variety of geophysical fields, and for spatial interpolation, out-of-sample extension, kriging, machine learning, and feature detection of geological data.

Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore, existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components: (1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively, surpassing existing methods by significant margins.</p></details> |  |
| **[DVLO4D: Deep Visual-Lidar Odometry with Sparse Spatial-temporal Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06023v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment, fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency, with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatial weights matrix selection and model averaging for multivariate spatial autoregressive models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06005v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we focus on the model specification problem in multivariate spatial econometric models when a candidate set for the spatial weights matrix is available. We propose a model selection method for the multivariate spatial autoregressive model, when the true spatial weights matrix may not be in the candidates. We show that the selected estimator is asymptotically optimal in the sense of minimizing the squared loss. If the candidate set contains the true spatial weights matrix, the method has selection consistency. We further propose a model averaging estimator that combines a set of candidate models and show its asymptotic optimality. Monte Carlo simulation results indicate that the proposed model selection and model averaging estimators perform quite well in finite samples. The proposed methods are applied to a Sina Weibo data to reveal how the user's posting behavior is influenced by the users that he follows. The analysis results indicate that the influence tends to be uniformly distributed among the user's followee, or linearly correlated with the number of followers of the followee.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Aware Self-Supervision for Medical 3D Imaging with Multi-Granularity Observable Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05967v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging. Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies, while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum spatial best-arm identification via quantum walks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05890v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum reinforcement learning has emerged as a framework combining quantum computation with sequential decision-making, and applications to the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem have been reported. The graph bandit problem extends the MAB setting by introducing spatial constraints, yet quantum approaches remain limited. We propose a quantum algorithm for best-arm identification in graph bandits, termed Quantum Spatial Best-Arm Identification (QSBAI). The method employs quantum walks to encode superpositions over graph-constrained actions, extending amplitude amplification and generalizing the Quantum BAI algorithm via Szegedy's walk framework. This establishes a link between Grover-type search and reinforcement learning tasks with structural restrictions. We analyze complete and bipartite graphs, deriving the maximal success probability of identifying the best arm and the time step at which it is achieved. Our results highlight the potential of quantum walks to accelerate exploration in constrained environments and extend the applicability of quantum algorithms for decision-making.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |
| **[GeoAnalystBench: A GeoAI benchmark for assessing large language models for spatial analysis workflow and code generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05881v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have fueled growing interest in automating geospatial analysis and GIS workflows, yet their actual capabilities remain uncertain. In this work, we call for rigorous evaluation of LLMs on well-defined geoprocessing tasks before making claims about full GIS automation. To this end, we present GeoAnalystBench, a benchmark of 50 Python-based tasks derived from real-world geospatial problems and carefully validated by GIS experts. Each task is paired with a minimum deliverable product, and evaluation covers workflow validity, structural alignment, semantic similarity, and code quality (CodeBLEU). Using this benchmark, we assess both proprietary and open source models. Results reveal a clear gap: proprietary models such as ChatGPT-4o-mini achieve high validity 95% and stronger code alignment (CodeBLEU 0.39), while smaller open source models like DeepSeek-R1-7B often generate incomplete or inconsistent workflows (48.5% validity, 0.272 CodeBLEU). Tasks requiring deeper spatial reasoning, such as spatial relationship detection or optimal site selection, remain the most challenging across all models. These findings demonstrate both the promise and limitations of current LLMs in GIS automation and provide a reproducible framework to advance GeoAI research with human-in-the-loop support.</p></details> | 34 pages, 8 figures |

Traditionally, this task relies on experienced clinicians to manually annotate data, a process that is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, deep learning methods have shown promise in automating this task. However, three major challenges remain: (1) deep learning models typically require large-scale labeled datasets, making them less effective in real-world settings where annotated data is limited; (2) significant inter-individual variability in bio-signals often results in inconsistent model performance when applied to new subjects, limiting generalization; and (3) existing approaches often overlook the high-order relationships among bio-signals, failing to simultaneously capture signal heterogeneity and spatial-temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose MetaSTH-Sleep, a few-shot sleep stage classification framework based on spatial-temporal hypergraph enhanced meta-learning. Our approach enables rapid adaptation to new subjects using only a few labeled samples, while the hypergraph structure effectively models complex spatial interconnections and temporal dynamics simultaneously in EEG signals. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaSTH-Sleep achieves substantial performance improvements across diverse subjects, offering valuable insights to support clinicians in sleep stage annotation.</p></details> |  |

In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual spider monkey core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. Sets of individuals with complementary overlaps are identified, showing a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions, and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures plus supplementary information with 15 pages, methods, model and 9 figures of results</p></details> |

However, some data have a complex spatial structure that cannot be adequately described with the physical distance alone. In this work, the spatial failure-time data of focus contains information on GPUs that are connected through a network fabric topology that differs from their physical layout and that is expected to introduce additional correlations. The proposed lifetime regression model includes random effects capturing the dependency due to physical location as well as random effects explaining the dependency due to logical connections between GPUs. The analysis of this GPU dataset serves as an example of models with multiple spatial random effects and the ideas presented can be extended to other applications with complex spatial structures. A Bayesian modeling scheme is recommended for this class of analyses. The examples in this work use the software package, Stan, to produce Markov chain Monte Carlo draws for parameter estimation. This modeling effort is validated through simulation which demonstrates accuracy in statistical inference. We also apply the developed framework to the large-scale Titan GPU failure time data.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |

This report introduces a forgery detection framework that combines spatial and frequency-based features for detecting forgeries. We propose a dual branch convolution neural network that operates on features extracted from spatial and frequency domains. Features from both branches are fused and compared within a Siamese network, yielding 64 dimensional embeddings for classification. When benchmarked on CASIA 2.0 dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 77.9%, outperforming traditional statistical methods. Despite its relatively weaker performance compared to larger, more complex forgery detection pipelines, our approach balances computational complexity and detection reliability, making it ready for practical deployment. It provides a strong methodology for forensic scrutiny of digital images. In a broader sense, it advances the state of the art in visual forensics, addressing an urgent requirement in media verification, law enforcement and digital content reliability.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS) strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations. Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word and synthetic LF datasets.</p></details> |  |

Effective cloud detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of Applied Remote Sensing</p></details> |

However, inference for ILMs is computationally intensive, especially as the total population size increases and additional covariates are incorporated. We propose a composite method, the composite ILM (C-ILM), that clusters the population into minimally-interfered subpopulations, with between-cluster infections enabled through a ``spark function.'' This approach allows for parallel computation of subsets before aggregation. Focusing on C-ILM, we consider four ``spark functions'', and introduce a Dirichlet process mixture modelling (DPMM) algorithm for clustering. Simulation results indicate that, in addition to faster computation, C-ILM performs well in parameter estimation and posterior predictions. Furthermore, within C-ILM framework, DPMM algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to the conventional $K$-means algorithm. We apply the methods to data from the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. The results provide evidence that C-ILM is not only computationally efficient but also achieves a better model fit compared to the basic spatial ILM.</p></details> |  |

It is comprised of entirely new real-world image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order of objects. The benchmark is designed to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not object localization capabilities. We release the dataset with a CC-BY-4.0 license and make the evaluation code available at: https://github.com/nilshoehing/rocketscience</p></details> |  |

Among the various Spatial Transcriptomics techniques available, Visium has emerged as the most widely adopted. However, its accessibility is limited by high costs, the need for specialized expertise, and slow clinical integration. Additionally, gene capture inefficiencies lead to significant dropout, corrupting acquired data. To address these challenges, the deep learning community has explored the gene expression prediction task directly from histology images. Yet, inconsistencies in datasets, preprocessing, and training protocols hinder fair comparisons between models. To bridge this gap, we introduce SpaRED, a systematically curated database comprising 26 public datasets, providing a standardized resource for model evaluation. We further propose SpaCKLE, a state-of-the-art transformer-based gene expression completion model that reduces mean squared error by over 82.5% compared to existing approaches. Finally, we establish the SpaRED benchmark, evaluating eight state-of-the-art prediction models on both raw and SpaCKLE-completed data, demonstrating SpaCKLE substantially improves the results across all the gene expression prediction models. Altogether, our contributions constitute the most comprehensive benchmark of gene expression prediction from histology images to date and a stepping stone for future research on Spatial Transcriptomics.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2407.13027</p></details> |
| **[Spatially-Enhanced Recurrent Memory for Long-Range Mapless Navigation via End-to-End Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05997v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in robot navigation, particularly with end-to-end learning approaches such as reinforcement learning (RL), have demonstrated strong performance. However, successful navigation still depends on two key capabilities: mapping and planning (explicitly or implicitly). Classical approaches rely on explicit mapping pipelines to register egocentric observations into a coherent map. In contrast, end-to-end learning often achieves this implicitly -- through recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that fuse current and historical observations into a latent space for planning. While existing architectures, such as LSTM and GRU, can capture temporal dependencies, our findings reveal a critical limitation: their inability to effectively perform spatial memorization. This capability is essential for integrating sequential observations from varying perspectives to build spatial representations that support planning. To address this, we propose Spatially-Enhanced Recurrent Units (SRUs) -- a simple yet effective modification to existing RNNs -- that enhance spatial memorization. We further introduce an attention-based network architecture integrated with SRUs, enabling long-range mapless navigation using a single forward-facing stereo camera. We also employ regularization techniques to facilitate robust end-to-end recurrent training via RL. Experimental results show 23.5% overall improvement in long-range navigation compared to existing RNNs. With SRU memory, our method outperforms RL baselines -- one relying on explicit mapping and the other on stacked historical observations -- by 29.6% and 105.0%, respectively, across diverse environments requiring long-horizon mapping and memorization. Finally, we address the sim-to-real gap by leveraging large-scale pretraining on synthetic depth data, enabling zero-shot transfer for deployment across diverse and complex real-world environments.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Spatial disaggregation of time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04065v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal modeling of economic aggregates is increasingly relevant in regional science due to the presence of both spatial spillovers and temporal dynamics. Traditional temporal disaggregation methods, such as Chow-Lin, often ignore spatial dependence, potentially losing important regional information. We propose a novel methodology for spatiotemporal disaggregation, integrating spatial autoregressive models, benchmarking restrictions, and auxiliary covariates. The approach accommodates partially observed regional data through an anchoring mechanism, ensuring consistency with known aggregates while reducing prediction variance. We establish identifiability and asymptotic normality of the estimator under general conditions, including non-Gaussian and heteroskedastic residuals. Extensive simulations confirm the method's robustness across a wide range of spatial autocorrelations and covariate informativeness. The methodology is illustrated by disaggregating Spanish GDP into 17 autonomous communities from 2002 to 2023, using auxiliary indicators and principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction. This framework extends classical temporal disaggregation to the spatial domain, providing accurate regional estimates while accounting for spatial spillovers and irregular data availability.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we present a novel deep learning framework that leverages the diagnostic value of 3D Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging for automated glaucoma detection. In this framework, we integrate a pre-trained Vision Transformer on retinal data for rich slice-wise feature extraction and a bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit for capturing inter-slice spatial dependencies. This dual-component approach enables comprehensive analysis of local nuances and global structural integrity, crucial for accurate glaucoma diagnosis. Experimental results on a large dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art ones, achieving an F1-score of 93.01%, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 69.33%, and AUC of 94.20%. The framework's ability to leverage the valuable information in 3D OCT data holds significant potential for enhancing clinical decision support systems and improving patient outcomes in glaucoma management.</p></details> |  |

SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Collaborative Spatial Perception via Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03837v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios. Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS) classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions, confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE GLOBECOM 2025</p></details> |

While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for SatML; we put special emphasis on a specific problem setting where our coauthors can immediately use our findings to augment clustered agricultural surveys for SatML monitoring in Togo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-preserving contrastive learning for spatial time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06380v4)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of neural network models largely relies on learning meaningful latent patterns from data, where self-supervised learning of informative representations can enhance model performance and generalisability. However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations. This provides insights to design more effective neural networks for data-driven transportation research. Our code is made openly accessible with all resulting data at https://github.com/yiru-jiao/spclt</p></details> | <details><summary>TL;DR...</summary><p>TL;DR: Preserving certain structures of similarity relations in spatio-temporal data can improve downstream task performance via contrastive learning</p></details> |

Previous Text-to-speech (TTS) works have focused primarily on the technical aspects of producing natural-sounding speech, such as intonation, rhythm, and clarity. However, they overlook the fact that there is a growing emphasis on spatial perception of synthesized speech, which may provide immersive experience in gaming and virtual reality. To solve this issue, in this paper, we present a novel multi-modal TTS approach, namely Image-indicated Immersive Text-to-speech Synthesis (I2TTS). Specifically, we introduce a scene prompt encoder that integrates visual scene prompts directly into the synthesis pipeline to control the speech generation process. Additionally, we propose a reverberation classification and refinement technique that adjusts the synthesized mel-spectrogram to enhance the immersive experience, ensuring that the involved reverberation condition matches the scene accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves high-quality scene and spatial matching without compromising speech naturalness, marking a significant advancement in the field of context-aware speech synthesis.

Recently, there has been growing interest in extending GPs to infer spatial derivatives, which are vital for analyzing spatial dynamics and detecting subtle changes in data patterns. Despite their utility, traditional GPs suffer from computational inefficiencies, due to the cubic scaling with the number of spatial locations. Fortunately, the computational challenge has spurred extensive research on scalable GP methods. However, these scalable approaches do not directly accommodate the inference of derivative processes. A straightforward approach is to use scalable GP models followed by finite-difference methods, known as the plug-in estimator. This approach, while intuitive, suffers from sensitivity to parameter choices, and the approximate gradient may not be a valid GP, leading to compromised inference. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Nearest-Neighbor Derivative Process (NNDP), an innovative framework that models the spatial processes and their derivatives within a single scalable GP model. NNDP significantly reduces the computational time complexity from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n)$, making it feasible for large datasets. We provide various theoretical supports for NNDP and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive simulations and real data analysis.</p></details> |  |

While multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models show difficulty perception misaligned with human intuition, exhibit dramatic 2Dto-3D performance cliffs, default to formulaic derivation over visualization, and paradoxically suffer performance degradation from Chain-of-Thought prompting in open-source models. Through statistical and qualitative analysis of error types, SpatialViz-Bench demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant lacuna in the field.

Recent advances, including a novel multiomics workflow, enable multiple rounds of MSI on the same tissue section, extracting diverse molecular classes, e.g., lipids, peptides, and N-glycans, while preserving spatial resolution. This innovation is particularly valuable for studies with limited tissue sample availability, such as rare diseases or small tumors. However, the resulting data are high-dimensional, spatially structured, and the various molecular types share the same pixel grid. To address these challenges, we propose Poseidon, a Bayesian nonparametric nested biclustering model that simultaneously segments the common tissue pixels and clusters molecular signals within each molecular class, leveraging the shared spatial structure. A separately exchangeable framework is first considered, and then extended to handle spatial data via hidden Markov random fields. For scalability, we implement an efficient mean-field variational inference algorithm tailored for multi-dataset analysis. After validating the efficacy of our method on simulated scenarios, we demonstrate the applicability of our model in a real-world case study, where multiomics measurements were performed on kidney tissue affected by clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The nested, hierarchical structure of Poseidon, combined with its principled inferential framework, allows the extraction of interesting biological insights, such as clear tissue segmentation and biomarker detection.</p></details> |  |

While current practices attempt to address this by organizing these phases into hybrid batches, such solutions create an inefficient tradeoff that sacrifices either throughput or latency, leaving substantial GPU resources underutilized. We identify two key root causes: 1) the prefill phase suffers from suboptimal compute utilization due to wave quantization and attention bottlenecks. 2) hybrid batches disproportionately prioritize latency over throughput, resulting in wasted compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate the issues, we present Bullet, a novel spatial-temporal orchestration system that eliminates these inefficiencies through precise phase coordination. Bullet enables concurrent execution of prefill and decode phases, while dynamically provisioning GPU resources using real-time performance modeling. By integrating SLO-aware scheduling and adaptive resource allocation, Bullet maximizes utilization without compromising latency targets. Experimental evaluations on real-world workloads demonstrate that Bullet delivers 1.26x average throughput gains (up to 1.55x) over state-of-the-arts, while consistently meeting latency constraints.</p></details> |  |

A Systematic Analysis from Data to Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02359v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view, and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.

To effectively capture spatial heterogeneity in distributional treatment effects, we propose a novel semiparametric neural network-based causal framework leveraging deep spatial quantile regression and then construct a plug-in estimator for spatial quantile treatment effects (SQTE). This framework incorporates an efficient adjustment procedure to mitigate the impact of spatial hidden confounders. Extensive simulations across various scenarios demonstrate that our methodology can accurately estimate SQTE, even with the presence of spatial hidden confounders. Additionally, the spatial confounding adjustment procedure effectively reduces neighborhood spatial patterns in the residuals. We apply this method to assess the spatially varying quantile treatment effects of maternal smoking on newborn birth weight in North Carolina, United States. Our findings consistently show negative effects across all birth weight quantiles, with particularly severe impacts observed in the lower quantile regions.</p></details> |  |
| **[ST-Hyper: Learning High-Order Dependencies Across Multiple Spatial-Temporal Scales for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02217v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, many deep learning based methods have been proposed for modeling dependencies at multiple spatial (inter-variate) or temporal (intra-variate) scales. However, existing methods may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales (ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of 3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Omnidirectional Spatial Modeling from Correlated Panoramas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02164v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the \textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories (\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Gene Diffusion for Spatial Transcriptomics Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01864v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion, with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space. Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of its isolated components.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Wrong Model, Right Uncertainty: Spatial Associations for Discrete Data with Misspecification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01776v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientists are often interested in estimating an association between a covariate and a binary- or count-valued response. For instance, public health officials are interested in how much disease presence (a binary response per individual) varies as temperature or pollution (covariates) increases. Many existing methods can be used to estimate associations, and corresponding uncertainty intervals, but make unrealistic assumptions in the spatial domain. For instance, they incorrectly assume models are well-specified. Or they assume the training and target locations are i.i.d. -- whereas in practice, these locations are often not even randomly sampled. Some recent work avoids these assumptions but works only for continuous responses with spatially constant noise. In the present work, we provide the first confidence intervals with guaranteed asymptotic nominal coverage for spatial associations given discrete responses, even under simultaneous model misspecification and nonrandom sampling of spatial locations. To do so, we demonstrate how to handle spatially varying noise, provide a novel proof of consistency for our proposed estimator, and use a delta method argument with a Lyapunov central limit theorem. We show empirically that standard approaches can produce unreliable confidence intervals and can even get the sign of an association wrong, while our method reliably provides correct coverage.</p></details> | 24 pages, 2 figures |
| **[A Time-Series Model for Areal Data Using Spatially Correlated Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01604v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional spatio-temporal models for areal data typically begin with spatial structure imposed at the level of random effects and later extend to include temporal dynamics. We propose an alternative hierarchical modeling framework that captures temporal trends in areal data through Gaussian processes that share spatial information via correlated variance components. This allows the model to better capture shared patterns of variability across regions while preserving local temporal dynamics, offering a more flexible representation of spatio-temporal processes. Specifically, we extend independent Gaussian-process models for time-series data to a spatially correlated framework by placing a conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior on the parameters governing the temporal variability and imposing a conditional dependence of the temporal range on the temporal variance. We apply this model to two case studies: monthly malaria incidence in Niassa, Mozambique, and weekly food insecurity prevalence in Cameroon. Inference is conducted within a Bayesian framework using approximate posterior sampling. Given the hierarchical structure of the model, we employ a combination of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, including the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA), Metropolis-Hastings, and Gibbs sampling. In both applications, the model demonstrates strong in-sample performance with narrow credible intervals and outperforms established spatio-temporal approaches in many regions when forecasting. These results underscore the model's ability to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies while maintaining interpretability, key in settings with sparse data and policy relevance. By accounting for spatio-temporal variation through the evolution of temporal dynamics themselves, our approach offers a flexible and principled tool for many applied contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material included</p></details> |

We use mixed Poisson models to analyze these patterns and to determine the association between mortality rates and various socioeconomic and contextual factors, while controlling for spatial and temporal confounding effects. Our results indicate that a 10% increase in the proportion of people residing in rural areas is associated with an increase of over 5% in male suicide mortality. In addition, a 1% increase in the annual unemployment rate is linked to a 2.4% increase in female suicide mortality. An important finding is that despite male suicide rates consistently being higher than female rates, we observe a notable and steady upward trend in female suicide mortality over the study period.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synergistic Dual Spatial-aware Generation of Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15312v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the visual spatial understanding (VSU) area, spatial image-to-text (SI2T) and spatial text-to-image (ST2I) are two fundamental tasks that appear in dual form. Existing methods for standalone SI2T or ST2I perform imperfectly in spatial understanding, due to the difficulty of 3D-wise spatial feature modeling. In this work, we consider modeling the SI2T and ST2I together under a dual learning framework. During the dual framework, we then propose to represent the 3D spatial scene features with a novel 3D scene graph (3DSG) representation that can be shared and beneficial to both tasks. Further, inspired by the intuition that the easier 3D$\to$image and 3D$\to$text processes also exist symmetrically in the ST2I and SI2T, respectively, we propose the Spatial Dual Discrete Diffusion (SD$^3$) framework, which utilizes the intermediate features of the 3D$\to$X processes to guide the hard X$\to$3D processes, such that the overall ST2I and SI2T will benefit each other. On the visual spatial understanding dataset VSD, our system outperforms the mainstream T2I and I2T methods significantly. Further in-depth analysis reveals how our dual learning strategy advances.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPSToken: Gaussian Parameterized Spatially-adaptive Tokenization for Image Representation and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01109v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform 2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel $\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive $\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position, and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position, covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding, Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks, followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128 tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at $\href{https://github.com/xtudbxk/GPSToken}{https://github.com/xtudbxk/GPSToken}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Maximum a Posteriori Probability (MAP) Joint Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) and Channel Estimation for MIMO Channels with Spatial and Temporal Correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01032v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider time varying MIMO fading channels with known spatial and temporal correlation and solve the problem of joint carrier frequency offset (CFO) and channel estimation with prior distributions. The maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) joint estimation is proved to be equivalent to a separate MAP estimation of the CFO followed by minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation of the channel while treating the estimated CFO as true. The MAP solution is useful to take advantage of the estimates from the previous data packet. A low complexity universal CFO estimation algorithm is extended from the time invariant case to the time varying case. Unlike past algorithms, the universal algorithm does not need phase unwrapping to take advantage of the full range of symbol correlation and achieves the derived Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (BCRLB) in almost all SNR range. We provide insight on the the relation among the temporal correlation coefficient of the fading, the CFO estimation performance, and the pilot signal structure. An unexpected observation is that the BCRLB is not a monotone function of the temporal correlation and is strongly influenced by the pilot signal structures. A simple rearrangement of the 0's and 1's in the pilot signal matrix will render the BCRLB from being non-monotone to being monotone in certain temporal correlation ranges. Since the BCRLB is shown to be achieved by the proposed algorithm, it provides a guideline for pilot signal design.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages.

However, the presence of multistate current status endpoints, where only a single snapshot of each subject's progression through disease states is available at a random inspection time after a known starting state, complicates the inferential framework. In addition, these endpoints can be clustered, and spatially associated, where a group of proximally located teeth (within subjects) may experience similar PD status, compared to those distally located. Motivated by a clinical study recording PD progression, we propose a Bayesian semiparametric accelerated failure time model with an inverse-Wishart proposal for accommodating (spatial) random effects, and flexible errors that follow a Dirichlet process mixture of Gaussians. For clinical interpretability, the systematic component of the event times is modeled using a monotone single index model, with the (unknown) link function estimated via a novel integrated basis expansion and basis coefficients endowed with constrained Gaussian process priors. In addition to establishing parameter identifiability, we present scalable computing via a combination of elliptical slice sampling, fast circulant embedding techniques, and smoothing of hard constraints, leading to straightforward estimation of parameters, and state occupation and transition probabilities. Using synthetic data, we study the finite sample properties of our Bayesian estimates, and their performance under model misspecification. We also illustrate our method via application to the real clinical PD dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Dimensional Spatial Autoregression with Latent Factors by Diversified Projections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00742v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study one particular type of multivariate spatial autoregression (MSAR) model with diverging dimensions in both responses and covariates. This makes the usual MSAR models no longer applicable due to the high computational cost. To address this issue, we propose a factor-augmented spatial autoregression (FSAR) model. FSAR is a special case of MSAR but with a novel factor structure imposed on the high-dimensional random error vector. The latent factors of FSAR are assumed to be of a fixed dimension. Therefore, they can be estimated consistently by the diversified projections method \citep{fan2022learning}, as long as the dimension of the multivariate response is diverging. Once the fixed-dimensional latent factors are consistently estimated, they are then fed back into the original SAR model and serve as exogenous covariates. This leads to a novel FSAR model. Thereafter, different components of the high-dimensional response can be modeled separately. To handle the high-dimensional feature, a smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) type penalized estimator is developed for each response component. We show theoretically that the resulting SCAD estimator is uniformly selection consistent, as long as the tuning parameter is selected appropriately. For practical selection of the tuning parameter, a novel BIC method is developed. Extensive numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the finite sample performance of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

While existing trajectory planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i) a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives, providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.</p></details> |  |

To further improve T2I models' capability in numerical and spatial reasoning, layout is employed as an intermedium to bridge large language models and layout-based diffusion models. However, these methods often rely on closed-source, large-scale LLMs for layout prediction, limiting accessibility and scalability. They also struggle with generating images from prompts with multiple objects and complicated spatial relationships. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a divide-and-conquer approach which decouples the generation task into multiple subtasks. First, the layout prediction stage is divided into numerical & spatial reasoning and bounding box visual planning, enabling even lightweight LLMs to achieve layout accuracy comparable to large-scale models. Second, the layout-to-image generation stage is divided into two steps to synthesize objects from easy ones to difficult ones. Experiments are conducted on the HRS and NSR-1K benchmarks and our method outperforms previous approaches with notable margins. In addition, visual results and user study demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the perceptual quality, especially when generating multiple objects from complex textural prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECAI 2025</p></details> |

Nutrient stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment. Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral, and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data, document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low, medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies. We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop management and improved plant health.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 7 Tables</p></details> |

While spatio-temporal graph (STG) models are a leading paradigm for such data, they often fall short in dynamic, human-centric environments due to two fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on static graph topologies, which fail to capture physical, event-driven dynamics, and (2) their tendency to confuse spurious correlations with true causality, undermining robustness in human-centric environments. To address these gaps, we propose the Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (DyC-STG), a novel framework designed for real-time data credibility analysis in IoT. Our framework features two synergistic contributions: an event-driven dynamic graph module that adapts the graph topology in real-time to reflect physical state changes, and a causal reasoning module to distill causally-aware representations by strictly enforcing temporal precedence. To facilitate the research in this domain we release two new real-world datasets. Comprehensive experiments show that DyC-STG establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving an F1-Score of up to 0.930.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks Approach for Predicting Silent Data Corruption inducing Circuit-Level Faults](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06289v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Silent Data Errors (SDEs) from time-zero defects and aging degrade safety-critical systems. Functional testing detects SDE-related faults but is expensive to simulate. We present a unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) for fast, accurate prediction of long-cycle fault impact probabilities (FIPs) in large sequential circuits, supporting quantitative risk assessment. Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to capture topology and signal timing; dedicated spatial and temporal encoders predict multi-cycle FIPs efficiently. On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). The framework accepts features from testability metrics or fault simulation, allowing efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. A test-point selection study shows that choosing observation points by predicted FIPs improves detection of long-cycle, hard-to-detect faults. The approach scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization and fits downstream electronic design automation flows.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, plan to submit to ACM TODAES</p></details> |

Traditional input modalities, such as Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements. Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network (MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI, comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures (VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety of applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the precise and efficient decoding of MI remains challenging due to their non-stationary nature and low signal-to-noise ratio. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end deep learning framework of Discriminative Residual Dense Convolutional Autoencoder with Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (DRDCAE-STGNN) to enhance the MI feature learning and classification. Specifically, the DRDCAE module leverages residual-dense connections to learn discriminative latent representations through joint reconstruction and classifica-tion, while the STGNN module captures dynamic spatial dependencies via a learnable graph adjacency matrix and models temporal dynamics using bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM). Extensive evaluations on BCI Competition IV 2a, 2b, and PhysioNet datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 95.42%, 97.51%, and 90.15%, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component, and interpreta-bility analysis reveals neurophysiologically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, despite its complexity, the model maintains a feasible parameter count and an inference time of 0.32 ms per sample. These results indicate that our method offers a robust, accurate, and interpretable solution for MI-EEG decoding, with strong generalizability across subjects and tasks and meeting the requirements for potential real-time BCI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to IEEE Journal</p></details> |

However, existing solutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target variables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into the model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to promote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two challenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the target system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and future variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \model, a novel framework for modeling \underline{exo}genous variables in \underline{s}patio-\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select, then balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated expert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent space to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized sub-experts. Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which recomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs are integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic balance during the modeling process. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency of our proposed framework.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

To address key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro) contribute marginally.

Specifically, we model the observations by two weakly time-stationary point processes with spatial intensity measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ over the expanding window $(0,t]$ as $t$ increases to infinity, and establish sharp convergence rates of the empirical UOT in terms of the intrinsic dimensions of the measures. We assume a sub-quadratic temporal growth condition of the variance of the process, which allows for a wide range of temporal dependencies. As the growth approaches quadratic, the convergence rate becomes slower. This variance assumption is related to the time-reduced factorial covariance measure, and we exemplify its validity for various point processes, including the Poisson cluster, Hawkes, Neyman-Scott, and log-Gaussian Cox processes. Complementary to our upper bounds, we also derive matching lower bounds for various spatio-temporal point processes of interest and establish near minimax rate optimality of the empirical Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally, 76 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[S2M2ECG: Spatio-temporal bi-directional State Space Model Enabled Multi-branch Mamba for ECG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03066v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the most effective methods for cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis, multi-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals present a characteristic multi-sensor information fusion challenge that has been continuously researched in deep learning domains. Despite the numerous algorithms proposed with different DL architectures, maintaining a balance among performance, computational complexity, and multi-source ECG feature fusion remains challenging. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across various fields. Their inherent design for high-efficiency computation and linear complexity makes them particularly suitable for low-dimensional data like ECGs. This work proposes S2M2ECG, an SSM architecture featuring three-level fusion mechanisms: (1) Spatio-temporal bi-directional SSMs with segment tokenization for low-level signal fusion, (2) Intra-lead temporal information fusion with bi-directional scanning to enhance recognition accuracy in both forward and backward directions, (3) Cross-lead feature interaction modules for spatial information fusion. To fully leverage the ECG-specific multi-lead mechanisms inherent in ECG signals, a multi-branch design and lead fusion modules are incorporated, enabling individual analysis of each lead while ensuring seamless integration with others. Experimental results reveal that S2M2ECG achieves superior performance in the rhythmic, morphological, and clinical scenarios. Moreover, its lightweight architecture ensures it has nearly the fewest parameters among existing models, making it highly suitable for efficient inference and convenient deployment. Collectively, S2M2ECG offers a promising alternative that strikes an excellent balance among performance, computational complexity, and ECG-specific characteristics, paving the way for high-performance, lightweight computations in CVD diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Sequential Ordinal Models: Application to Invasive Weeds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01976v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multivariate sequential ordinal model is investigated for use in the Bayesian analysis of spatio-temporal ordinal data. The sequential ordinal model likelihood is equivalent to a binary model conditional on unknown regression coefficients and spatio-temporal random effects. Therefore, estimation and prediction in the space-time context can proceed using the well-established dynamic generalised linear model framework. Moreover, the sequential ordinal model avoids the ordering constraints on the threshold parameters that determine the category break points required by cumulative ordinal models, and so simplifies the estimation procedure for high-dimensional space-time applications using Bayesian inference. The dynamic spatio-temporal sequential ordinal model is applied to estimate foliage cover abundance of four actively managed invasive alien species. These invasive weed species are observed by means of a modified Braun-Blanquet score that is commonly used in vegetation studies and constitutes ordinal data. The multivariate ordinal data for the managed weeds species are sparsely distributed in space and time with few observations recorded in high foliage cover categories. A separable model for space-time dependence that maintains parameter interpretability in the presence of aggregated ordinal categories is therefore developed. Estimation and prediction is demonstrated using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) methods developed for univariate spatio-temporal models. Bayesian estimation and prediction shows that the four invasive weed species differentially respond to habitat type, control effort and accessibility, and share similar magnitudes of dependence with short effective spatial ranges and strong temporal autocorrelations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transforming Norm-based To Graph-based Spatial Representation for Spatio-Temporal Epidemiological Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14539v3)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pandemics, with their profound societal and economic impacts, pose significant threats to global health, mortality rates, economic stability, and political landscapes. In response to these challenges, numerous studies have employed spatio-temporal models to enhance our understanding and management of these complex phenomena. These spatio-temporal models can be roughly divided into two main spatial categories: norm-based and graph-based. Norm-based models are usually more accurate and easier to model but are more computationally intensive and require more data to fit. On the other hand, graph-based models are less accurate and harder to model but are less computationally intensive and require fewer data to fit. As such, ideally, one would like to use a graph-based model while preserving the representation accuracy obtained by the norm-based model. In this study, we explore the ability to transform from norm-based to graph-based spatial representation for these models. We first show no analytical mapping between the two exists, requiring one to use approximation numerical methods instead. We introduce a novel framework for this task together with twelve possible implementations using a wide range of heuristic optimization approaches. Our findings show that by leveraging agent-based simulations and heuristic algorithms for the graph node's location and population's spatial walk dynamics approximation one can use graph-based spatial representation without losing much of the model's accuracy and expressiveness. We investigate our framework for three real-world cases, achieving 94\% accuracy preservation, on average. Moreover, an analysis of synthetic cases shows the proposed framework is relatively robust for changes in both spatial and temporal properties.</p></details> |  |

While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model. Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic, implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate 1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Flow Matching for Learning Spatio-Temporal Trajectories in 4D Longitudinal Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21580v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions. While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e. predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports $3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.</p></details> |  |

To fully leverage this information, however, the extracted features must be organized in a structured and meaningful way that supports efficient access and use. One promising approach is question answering (QA), which allows users -- especially those unfamiliar with database query languages -- to retrieve knowledge in a natural and intuitive manner. In this project, we developed a GeoQA system by integrating a spatio-temporal knowledge graph (KG) constructed from historical map data with large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we have defined the ontology to guide the construction of the spatio-temporal KG and investigated workflows of two different types of GeoQA: factual and descriptive. Additional data sources, such as historical map images and internet search results, are incorporated into our framework to provide extra context for descriptive GeoQA. Evaluation results demonstrate that the system can generate answers with a high delivery rate and a high semantic accuracy. To make the framework accessible, we further developed a web application that supports interactive querying and visualization.</p></details> |  |

The proposed system requires neither access to multi-channel training data nor prior knowledge about the number or placement of microphones. It works for both a compact microphone array and distributed microphones, with minor adjustments. Due to its superior handling of overlapping speech during segmentation, the proposed pipeline significantly outperforms the single-channel pyannote approach, both in a scenario with a compact microphone array and in a setup with distributed microphones. Additionally, we show that, unlike fully spatial diarization pipelines, the proposed system can correctly track speakers when they change positions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of INTERSPEECH</p></details> |

They pose, however, significant computational challenges in high-dimensional settings, which frequently arise in spatial-temporal applications. We present DALIA, a highly scalable framework for performing Bayesian inference tasks on spatio-temporal multivariate GPs, based on the methodology of integrated nested Laplace approximations. Our approach relies on a sparse inverse covariance matrix formulation of the GP, puts forward a GPU-accelerated block-dense approach, and introduces a hierarchical, triple-layer, distributed memory parallel scheme. We showcase weak scaling performance surpassing the state-of-the-art by two orders of magnitude on a model whose parameter space is 8$\times$ larger and measure strong scaling speedups of three orders of magnitude when running on 496 GH200 superchips on the Alps supercomputer. Applying DALIA to air pollution data from northern Italy over 48 days, we showcase refined spatial resolutions over the aggregated pollutant measurements.</p></details> |  |

Privacy statutes such as the GDPR require that any individual's contribution be unlearned on demand, yet retraining deep models from scratch for every request is untenable. We introduce MobText-SISA, a scalable machine-unlearning framework that extends Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and Aggregated (SISA) training to heterogeneous spatio-temporal data. MobText-SISA first embeds each trip's numerical and linguistic features into a shared latent space, then employs similarity-aware clustering to distribute samples across shards so that future deletions touch only a single constituent model while preserving inter-shard diversity. Each shard is trained incrementally; at inference time, constituent predictions are aggregated to yield the output. Deletion requests trigger retraining solely of the affected shard from its last valid checkpoint, guaranteeing exact unlearning. Experiments on a ten-month real-world mobility log demonstrate that MobText-SISA (i) sustains baseline predictive accuracy, and (ii) consistently outperforms random sharding in both error and convergence speed. These results establish MobText-SISA as a practical foundation for privacy-compliant analytics on multimodal mobility data at urban scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The 33rd ACM International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems(SIGSPATIAL '25) as a short paper in the Short Paper Track</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network for Ejection Fraction Estimation in Echocardiography Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18681v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network (\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception. The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details, while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Pruning for Compressed Spiking Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20122v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant challenges for deployment in energy-constrained environments due to their large model sizes and high inference latency. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the sparse event-driven neural processing and energy-efficient information transmission in the brain, offer a promising alternative for achieving low-power computing. Integrating the event-driven efficiency of spiking neurons with the advanced capabilities of LLMs represents a promising direction for power-efficient LLMs. This work specifically delves into the design of compressed spiking LLMs. Here, we revisit spatial and temporal pruning from the perspective of SNNs and propose a novel spatio-temporal pruning framework for Spiking LLMs to optimize computational efficiency while preserving high performance. Our spatial pruning technique reduces the number of active neurons and attention heads, effectively lowering the computational complexity of the model. Meanwhile, temporal pruning minimizes inference latency by dynamically adjusting the number of timesteps required for different layers. By combining these approaches with other compression techniques, we present the first work in the domain of Spiking LLMs to jointly explore spatial pruning, temporal pruning, extreme quantization and knowledge distillation strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation of our proposed framework for SpikingBERT on the large-scale GLUE benchmark demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in terms of computational operations and inference latency. Our approach offers a compelling solution for real-time, low-power natural language processing applications, making Spiking LLMs more practical for deployment on edge devices and in power-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |

The approach enables nonparametric and data driven estimation of complex time evolving vector fields while preserving both spatial and temporal structure. We establish representer theorems for time dependent OV-RKHS interpolation, derive Sobolev type approximation bounds for smooth vector fields, and provide spectral convergence guarantees for kernel Koopman operator approximations. This framework supports efficient reduced order modeling and long term prediction of high dimensional nonlinear systems, offering theoretically grounded tools for forecasting, control, and uncertainty quantification in spatio-temporal machine learning.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Annua...</summary><p>Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 2025</p></details> |

Although various domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the adaptability of deep-based RPM models in unseen deployment environments, considerations in aspects such as privacy concerns and real-time adaptation restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for RPM tasks in this work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the frequency domain of BVP signals, but also that inconsistency in the time domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based self-supervised \textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration (\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference. Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation without accessing source data. The code will be released later.</p></details> |  |

However, current models struggle with ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i) Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii) Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior performance of STA-GANN.</p></details> |  |

While current spatial media technologies have primarily focused on capturing or replaying content as static assets, often disconnected from the viewer's environment or offering limited interactivity, the means to describe an experience's underlying semantic and interactive structure remains underexplored. We propose a descriptive framework called MAR-ED based on three core primitives: 1) Event Primitives for semantic scene graph representation, 2) Keyframe Primitives for efficient and meaningful data access, and 3) Playback Primitives for user-driven adaptive interactive playback of recorded MAR experience. The proposed flowchart of the three-stage process of the proposed MAR-ED framework transforms a recorded experience into a unique adaptive MAR experience during playback, where its spatio-temporal structure dynamically conforms to a new environment and its narrative can be altered by live user input. Drawing on this framework, personal digital memories and recorded events can evolve beyond passive 2D/3D videos into immersive, spatially-integrated group experiences, opening new paradigms for training, cultural heritage, and interactive storytelling without requiring complex, per-user adaptive rendering.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, Accepted in the IEEE ISMAR 2025 XRStand Workshop</p></details> |

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets.</p></details> |  |

Although Selective State Space Models (SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity, the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D, and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

While various dynamic computation methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn, allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes. Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%, and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA models.</p></details> | 8 pages |

| **[Compact Attention: Exploiting Structured Spatio-Temporal Sparsity for Fast Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12969v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computational demands of self-attention mechanisms pose a critical challenge for transformer-based video generation, particularly in synthesizing ultra-long sequences. Current approaches, such as factorized attention and fixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal redundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion transformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit structured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads dynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern, cross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods either impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a hardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive tiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via dynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity levels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search algorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention pathways. Our method achieves 1.6~2.5x acceleration in attention computation on single-GPU setups while maintaining comparable visual quality with full-attention baselines.

| **[Root Cause Analysis of Hydrogen Bond Separation in Spatio-Temporal Molecular Dynamics using Causal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12500v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) face challenges, including resource-heavy computations and the need to manually scan outputs to detect "interesting events," such as the formation and persistence of hydrogen bonds between atoms of different molecules. A critical research gap lies in identifying the underlying causes of hydrogen bond formation and separation -understanding which interactions or prior events contribute to their emergence over time. With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal data analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these phenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims to identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation events. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an "intervention" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and separation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models are built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us to infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal graphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step to infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal models. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional distributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation, this framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular dynamic systems. We validate the efficacy of our model empirically on the atomic trajectories that used MDS for chiral separation, demonstrating that we can predict many steps in the future and also find the variables driving the observed changes in the system.</p></details> | Submitted to ACM |
| **[STM3: Mixture of Multiscale Mamba for Long-Term Spatio-Temporal Time-Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12247v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, spatio-temporal time-series prediction has developed rapidly, yet existing deep learning methods struggle with learning complex long-term spatio-temporal dependencies efficiently. The long-term spatio-temporal dependency learning brings two new challenges: 1) The long-term temporal sequence includes multiscale information naturally which is hard to extract efficiently; 2) The multiscale temporal information from different nodes is highly correlated and hard to model. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM2) that includes a multiscale Mamba architecture to capture the multiscale information efficiently and simultaneously, and an adaptive graph causal convolution network to learn the complex multiscale spatio-temporal dependency. STM2 includes hierarchical information aggregation for different-scale information that guarantees their distinguishability. To capture diverse temporal dynamics across all spatial nodes more efficiently, we further propose an enhanced version termed \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM3) that employs a special Mixture-of-Experts architecture, including a more stable routing strategy and a causal contrastive learning strategy to enhance the scale distinguishability. We prove that STM3 has much better routing smoothness and guarantees the pattern disentanglement for each expert successfully. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate STM2/STM3's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in long-term spatio-temporal time-series prediction.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposed PTSM (Physiology-aware and Task-invariant Spatio-temporal Modeling), a novel framework for interpretable and robust EEG decoding across unseen subjects. PTSM employs a dual-branch masking mechanism that independently learns personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns, enabling the model to preserve individual-specific neural characteristics while extracting task-relevant, population-shared features. The masks are factorized across temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing fine-grained modulation of dynamic EEG patterns with low computational overhead. To further address representational entanglement, PTSM enforces information-theoretic constraints that decompose latent embeddings into orthogonal task-related and subject-related subspaces. The model is trained end-to-end via a multi-objective loss integrating classification, contrastive, and disentanglement objectives. Extensive experiments on cross-subject motor imagery datasets demonstrate that PTSM achieves strong zero-shot generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without subject-specific calibration. Results highlight the efficacy of disentangled neural representations for achieving both personalized and transferable decoding in non-stationary neurophysiological settings.</p></details> |  |

While recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding, their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs, revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task. Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning. To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Conventional approaches based on large-scale fixed antenna arrays and UAV trajectory optimization struggle to balance energy efficiency, real-time adaptation, and spatial flexibility. The movable antenna (MA) technology has emerged as a promising solution, offering enhanced spatial flexibility and reduced energy consumption to overcome the bottlenecks of urban low-altitude communications. However, MA deployment faces a critical velocity mismatch between UAV mobility and mechanical repositioning latency, undermining real-time link optimization and security assurance. To overcome this, we propose a predictive MA-UAV collaborative control framework. First, optimal antenna positions are derived via secrecy rate maximization. Second, a Transformer-enhanced long short-term memory (LSTM) network predicts future MA positions by capturing spatio-temporal correlations in antenna trajectories. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior prediction accuracy (NMSE reduction exceeds 49\%) and communication reliability versus current popular benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Retrieval Augmented Spatio-Temporal Framework for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16623v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is a cornerstone of modern intelligent transportation systems and a critical task in spatio-temporal forecasting. Although advanced Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain: (i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns; and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Autoregressions for High Dimensional Matrix-Valued Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10291v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by predicting intraday trading volume curves, we consider two spatio-temporal autoregressive models for matrix time series, in which each column may represent daily trading volume curve of one asset, and each row captures synchronized 5-minute volume intervals across multiple assets. While traditional matrix time series focus mainly on temporal evolution, our approach incorporates both spatial and temporal dynamics, enabling simultaneous analysis of interactions across multiple dimensions. The inherent endogeneity in spatio-temporal autoregressive models renders ordinary least squares estimation inconsistent. To overcome this difficulty while simultaneously estimating two distinct weight matrices with banded structure, we develop an iterated generalized Yule-Walker estimator by adapting a generalized method of moments framework based on Yule-Walker equations. Moreover, unlike conventional models that employ a single bandwidth parameter, the dual-bandwidth specification in our framework requires a new two-step, ratio-based sequential estimation procedure.</p></details> |  |
| **[XGBoost meets INLA: a two-stage spatio-temporal forecasting of wildfires in Portugal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09896v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wildfires pose a major threat to Portugal, with an average of over 115,000 hectares burned annually in the 45-year period of 1980-2024. Beyond a high number of ignitions, the country has experienced devastating mega-fires, such as those in 2017. Accurate forecasting of wildfire occurrence and burned areas is therefore essential for effective firefighting resource allocation and emergency preparedness. In this study, we present a novel two-stage ensemble approach that extends the widely used latent Gaussian modelling framework with the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) for spatio-temporal wildfire forecasting. The first stage uses XGBoost, a gradient boosting model, to identify wildfire patterns from environmental covariates and historical fire records, producing one-month-ahead point forecasts for fire counts and burned area. These predictions are then incorporated as external covariates in a latent Gaussian model, which includes additional spatiotemporal random effects to produce the final probabilistic forecasts of monthly total fire counts and burned area at the council level. To effectively model both moderate and extreme wildfire events, we implement the extended generalised Pareto (eGP) likelihood (a sub-asymptotic distribution) within the INLA framework. We also develop and discuss penalised complexity priors (PC-priors) for the eGP parameters and provide a comprehensive comparison of the eGP likelihood against other commonly employed distributions in environmental modelling, such as the Gamma and Weibull distributions. The proposed framework addresses the challenge of accessing future environmental covariates, which are typically unavailable at prediction time, and demonstrates strong performance in one-month-ahead wildfire forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We present STAC, a cross-cameras surveillance system that leverages spatio-temporal associations for efficient object tracking under constrained network conditions. STAC integrates multi-resolution feature learning, ensuring robustness under variable networked system level optimizations such as frame filtering, FFmpeg-based compression, and Region-of-Interest (RoI) masking, to eliminate redundant content across distributed video streams while preserving downstream model accuracy for object identification and tracking. Evaluated on NVIDIA's AICity Challenge dataset, STAC achieves a 76\% improvement in tracking accuracy and an 8.6x reduction in inference latency over a standard multi-object multi-camera tracking baseline (using YOLOv4 and DeepSORT). Furthermore, 29\% of redundant frames are filtered, significantly reducing data volume without compromising inference quality.</p></details> |  |

Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

We introduce a Physics- and Geometry- Aware Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator ($\pi$G-Sp$^2$GNO) for learning the solution operators of time-independent and time-dependent PDEs. The proposed approach first improves upon the recently developed Sp$^2$GNO by enabling geometry awareness and subsequently exploits the governing physics to learn the underlying solution operator in a simulation-free setup. While the spatio-spectral structure present in the proposed architecture allows multiscale learning, two separate strategies for enabling geometry awareness is introduced in this paper. For time dependent problems, we also introduce a novel hybrid physics informed loss function that combines higher-order time-marching scheme with upscaled theory inspired stochastic projection scheme. This allows accurate integration of the physics-information into the loss function. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated on number of benchmark examples involving regular and complex domains, variation in geometry during inference, and time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results obtained illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach as compared to the state-of-the-art physics-informed neural operator algorithms in the literature.</p></details> |  |

Thus, the USVs need to continuously adapt their paths with real-time information to avoid collisions and follow the path of least resistance to the goal via exploiting ocean currents. In this regard, we introduce a novel algorithm, called Self-Morphing Adaptive Replanning Tree for dynamic Obstacles and Currents (SMART-OC), that facilitates real-time time-risk optimal replanning in dynamic environments. SMART-OC integrates the obstacle risks along a path with the time cost to reach the goal to find the time-risk optimal path. The effectiveness of SMART-OC is validated by simulation experiments, which demonstrate that the USV performs fast replannings to avoid dynamic obstacles and exploit ocean currents to successfully reach the goal.</p></details> |  |

Despite this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI. This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}. To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for \underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, incomplete version</p></details> |
| **[Urban-STA4CLC: Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08976v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires increasingly introduce unusual disturbance on economic activities, which are especially likely to reshape commercial land use pattern given their sensitive to customer visitation. However, current modeling approaches are limited in capturing such complex interplay between human activities and commercial land use change under and following disturbances. Such interactions have been more effectively captured in current resilient urban planning theories. This study designs and calibrates a Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change (Urban-STA4CLC) to predict both the yearly decline and expansion of commercial land use at census block level under cumulative impact of disasters on human activities over two years. Guided by urban theories, Urban-STA4CLC integrates both spatial and temporal attention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules. Resilience theory guides a disaster-aware temporal attention module that captures visitation dynamics. Spatial economic theory informs a multi-relational spatial attention module for inter-block representation. Diffusion theory contributes a regularization term that constrains land use transitions. The model performs significantly better than non-theoretical baselines in predicting commercial land use change under the scenario of recurrent hurricanes, with around 19% improvement in F1 score (0.8763). The effectiveness of the theory-guided modules was further validated through ablation studies. The research demonstrates that embedding urban theory into commercial land use modeling models may substantially enhance the capacity to capture its gains and losses. These advances in commercial land use modeling contribute to land use research that accounts for cumulative impacts of recurrent disasters and shifts in economic activity patterns.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often rely on complex module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts, high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency, reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while maintaining competitive recognition performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[B-VLLM: A Vision Large Language Model with Balanced Spatio-Temporal Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09919v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) integrated with vision encoders have shown promising performance in vision understanding. The key of VLLMs is to encode visual content into sequences of visual tokens, enabling VLLMs to simultaneously process both visual and textual content. However, understanding videos, especially long videos, remain a challenge to VLLMs as the number of visual tokens grows rapidly when encoding videos, resulting in the risk of exceeding the context window of VLLMs and introducing heavy computation burden. To restrict the number of visual tokens, existing VLLMs either: (1) uniformly downsample videos into a fixed number of frames or (2) reducing the number of visual tokens encoded from each frame. We argue the former solution neglects the rich temporal cue in videos and the later overlooks the spatial details in each frame. In this work, we present Balanced-VLLM (B-VLLM): a novel VLLM framework that aims to effectively leverage task relevant spatio-temporal cues while restricting the number of visual tokens under the VLLM context window length. At the core of our method, we devise a text-conditioned adaptive frame selection module to identify frames relevant to the visual understanding task. The selected frames are then de-duplicated using a temporal frame token merging technique. The visual tokens of the selected frames are processed through a spatial token sampling module and an optional spatial token merging strategy to achieve precise control over the token count. Experimental results show that B-VLLM is effective in balancing the number of frames and visual tokens in video understanding, yielding superior performance on various video understanding benchmarks.

While many spatio-temporal methods focus on improving accuracy, fairness has recently gained attention due to growing evidence that biased predictions in spatio-temporal applications can disproportionately disadvantage certain demographic or geographic groups, thereby reinforcing existing socioeconomic inequalities and undermining the ethical deployment of AI in public services. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, FairDRL-ST, based on disentangled representation learning, to address fairness concerns in spatio-temporal prediction, with a particular focus on mobility demand forecasting. By leveraging adversarial learning and disentangled representation learning, our framework learns to separate attributes that contain sensitive information. Unlike existing methods that enforce fairness through supervised learning, which may lead to overcompensation and degraded performance, our framework achieves fairness in an unsupervised manner with minimal performance loss. We apply our framework to real-world urban mobility datasets and demonstrate its ability to close fairness gaps while delivering competitive predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art fairness-aware methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Research Paper (short) at ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025.

However, there exist very limited FL works in surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider inherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show diverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation; ii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data generation with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized FL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST), which wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and global-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site training, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to encode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized globally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including the temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel selection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating model adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an explicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model convergence during fusion for improving model generalization.</p></details> |  |

Given that the typical data (i.e., videos and images) collected by the fleet of UAVs deployed in such scenarios can be considerably larger than what the onboard computers can process, the UAVs need to offload their data in real-time to the edge and the cloud for further processing. To that end, we present the design of AerialDB - a lightweight decentralized data storage and query system that can store and process time series data on a multi-UAV system comprising: A) a fleet of hundreds of UAVs fitted with onboard computers, and B) ground-based edge servers connected through a cellular link. Leveraging lightweight techniques for content-based replica placement and indexing of shards, AerialDB has been optimized for efficient processing of different possible combinations of typical spatial and temporal queries performed by real-world disaster management applications. Using containerized deployment spanning up to 400 drones and 80 edges, we demonstrate that AerialDB is able to scale efficiently while providing near real-time performance with different realistic workloads. Further, AerialDB comprises a decentralized and locality-aware distributed execution engine which provides graceful degradation of performance upon edge failures with relatively low latency while processing large spatio-temporal data. AerialDB exhibits comparable insertion performance and 100 times improvement in query performance against state-of-the-art baseline. Moreover, it exhibits a 10 times and 100 times improvement with insertion and query workloads respectively over the cloud baseline.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the first treatment-aware spatio-temporal diffusion model that is able to generate future masks demonstrating lesion evolution in MS. Our voxel-space approach incorporates multi-modal patient data, including MRI and treatment information, to forecast new and enlarging T2 (NET2) lesion masks at a future time point. Extensive experiments on a multi-centre dataset of 2131 patient 3D MRIs from randomized clinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS demonstrate that our generative model is able to accurately predict NET2 lesion masks for patients across six different treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate our model has the potential for real-world clinical applications through downstream tasks such as future lesion count and location estimation, binary lesion activity classification, and generating counterfactual future NET2 masks for several treatments with different efficacies. This work highlights the potential of causal, image-based generative models as powerful tools for advancing data-driven prognostics in MS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI 2025 (LMID Workshop)</p></details> |

Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity, normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33 ground-based sensors.

While the fusion of surround-view 4D radar and cameras offers a promising low-cost solution, effectively extracting and integrating features from these heterogeneous sensors remains challenging. This paper introduces MetaOcc, a novel multi-modal framework for omnidirectional 3D occupancy prediction that leverages both multi-view 4D radar and images. To address the limitations of directly applying LiDAR-oriented encoders to sparse radar data, we propose a Radar Height Self-Attention module that enhances vertical spatial reasoning and feature extraction. Additionally, a Hierarchical Multi-scale Multi-modal Fusion strategy is developed to perform adaptive local-global fusion across modalities and time, mitigating spatio-temporal misalignments and enriching fused feature representations. To reduce reliance on expensive point cloud annotations, we further propose a pseudo-label generation pipeline based on an open-set segmentor. This enables a semi-supervised strategy that achieves 90% of the fully supervised performance using only 50% of the ground truth labels, offering an effective trade-off between annotation cost and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaOcc under full supervision achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by +0.47 SC IoU and +4.02 mIoU on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, and by +1.16 SC IoU and +1.24 mIoU on the SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset. These results demonstrate the scalability and robustness of MetaOcc across sensor domains and training conditions, paving the way for practical deployment in real-world autonomous systems.

| **[Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing Forecast for Long-term Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02689v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting uses recent measurements by sensors installed at chosen locations to forecast the future road traffic. Existing work either assumes all locations are equipped with sensors or focuses on short-term forecast. This paper studies partial sensing forecast of long-term traffic, assuming sensors are available only at some locations. The problem is challenging due to the unknown data distribution at unsensed locations, the intricate spatio-temporal correlation in long-term forecasting, as well as noise to traffic patterns. We propose a Spatio-temporal Long-term Partial sensing Forecast model (SLPF) for traffic prediction, with several novel contributions, including a rank-based embedding technique to reduce the impact of noise in data, a spatial transfer matrix to overcome the spatial distribution shift from sensed locations to unsensed locations, and a multi-step training process that utilizes all available data to successively refine the model parameters for better accuracy. Extensive experiments on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate its superior performance.

We implement a Bayesian hierarchical Beta regression model to analyze regional obesity rates, integrating spatial and temporal random effects, alongside gender and various exogenous predictors. The model leverages the Stochastic Search Variable Selection technique to identify significant predictors supported by the data. The analysis reveals both regional heterogeneity and dependence in obesity rates over the study period, emphasizing the importance of considering gender and spatial correlation in explaining its dynamics over time. In fact, the inclusion of structured spatial and temporal random effects captures the complexities of regional variations over time. These random effects, along with gender, emerge as the primary determinants of obesity prevalence across Italian regions, while the role of exogenous covariates is found to be minimal at the regional level. While socioeconomic and lifestyle factors remain fundamental at a micro-level, the findings demonstrate that the integration of spatial and temporal structures is critical for capturing macro-level obesity variations.</p></details> |  |

LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in dynamic outdoor environments. We provide rendered 4D LiDAR videos, generated dataset, and inference outputs on diverse scenarios at: https://mmb4dl.github.io/mmb4dl/</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Robust Spatio-Temporal Distributional Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05041v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by investigating spatio-temporal patterns of the distribution of continuous variables, we consider describing the conditional distribution function of the response variable incorporating spatio-temporal components given predictors. In many applications, continuous variables are observed only as threshold-categorized data due to measurement constraints. For instance, ecological measurements often categorize sizes into intervals rather than recording exact values due to practical limitations. To recover the conditional distribution function of the underlying continuous variables, we consider a distribution regression employing models for binomial data obtained at each threshold value. However, depending on spatio-temporal conditions and predictors, the distribution function may frequently exhibit boundary values (zero or one), which can occur either structurally or randomly. This makes standard binomial models inadequate, requiring more flexible modeling approaches. To address this issue, we propose a boundary-inflated binomial model incorporating spatio-temporal components. The model is a three-component mixture of the binomial model and two Dirac measures at zero and one. We develop a computationally efficient Bayesian inference algorithm using P\'olya-Gamma data augmentation and dynamic Gaussian predictive processes. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our procedure significantly outperforms distribution regression methods based on standard binomial models across various scenarios.</p></details> | 29 pages, 1 figure |
| **[STARFormer: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Reorganization Transformer of FMRI for Brain Disorder Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00378v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many existing methods that use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) classify brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), often overlook the integration of spatial and temporal dependencies of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which may lead to inaccurate or imprecise classification results. To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research. The codes are available at: https://github.com/NZWANG/STARFormer.</p></details> |  |
| **[UltraSTF: Ultra-Compact Model for Large-Scale Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20634v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal data, prevalent in real-world applications such as traffic monitoring, financial transactions, and ride-share demands, represents a specialized case of multivariate time series characterized by high dimensionality. This high dimensionality necessitates computationally efficient models and benefits from applying univariate forecasting approaches through channel-independent strategies. SparseTSF, a recently proposed competitive univariate forecasting model, leverages periodicity to achieve compactness by focusing on cross-period dynamics, extending the Pareto frontier in terms of model size and predictive performance. However, it underperforms on spatio-temporal data due to limited capture of intra-period temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose UltraSTF, which integrates a cross-period forecasting component with an ultra-compact shape bank component. Our model efficiently captures recurring patterns in time series using the attention mechanism of the shape bank component, significantly enhancing its capability to learn intra-period dynamics. UltraSTF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LargeST benchmark while utilizing fewer than 0.2% of the parameters required by the second-best methods, thereby further extending the Pareto frontier of existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

The architecture, called STARE (Spatio-Temporal Attention Representation for Eye Tracking), uses a new tokenization strategy, which involves mapping the x- and y- pixel coordinates of eye-movement time series on predefined, contiguous Regions of Interest. That tokenization makes the spatio-temporal eye-movement data available to the Chronos, a time-series foundation model based on the T5 architecture, to which co-attention and/or cross-attention is added to capture directional and/or interocular influences of eye movements. We compare STARE with several state-of-the art alternatives on multiple datasets with the purpose of predicting consumer choice behaviors from eye movements. We thus make a first step towards developing and testing DL architectures that represent visual attention dynamics rooted in the neurophysiology of eye movements.</p></details> |  |

Prior work primarily focuses on single-frame cooperative perception, which fuses agents' information across different spatial locations but ignores temporal cues and temporal tasks (e.g., temporal perception and prediction). In this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal fusion in V2X scenarios and design one-step and multi-step communication strategies (when to transmit) as well as examine their integration with three fusion strategies - early, late, and intermediate (what to transmit), providing comprehensive benchmarks with 11 fusion models (how to fuse). Furthermore, we propose V2XPnP, a novel intermediate fusion framework within one-step communication for end-to-end perception and prediction. Our framework employs a unified Transformer-based architecture to effectively model complex spatio-temporal relationships across multiple agents, frames, and high-definition maps. Moreover, we introduce the V2XPnP Sequential Dataset that supports all V2X collaboration modes and addresses the limitations of existing real-world datasets, which are restricted to single-frame or single-mode cooperation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perception and prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Website link: https://mobility-lab.seas.ucla.edu/v2xpnp/</p></details> |

It supports governmental efforts, particularly those led by the international telecommunication union (ITU), to establish fair spectrum allocation policies, improve auction mechanisms, and meet the requirements of emerging technologies such as advanced 5G, forthcoming 6G, and the internet of things (IoT). This paper presents an effective spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages crowdsourced user-side key performance indicators (KPIs) and regulatory datasets to model and forecast spectrum demand. The proposed methodology achieves superior prediction accuracy and cross-regional generalizability by incorporating advanced feature engineering, comprehensive correlation analysis, and transfer learning techniques. Unlike traditional ITU models, which are often constrained by arbitrary inputs and unrealistic assumptions, this approach exploits granular, data-driven insights to account for spatial and temporal variations in spectrum utilization. Comparative evaluations against ITU estimates, as the benchmark, underscore our framework's capability to deliver more realistic and actionable predictions. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our methodology, highlighting its potential as a robust approach for policymakers and regulatory bodies to enhance spectrum management and planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be presented at IEEE PIMRC 2025</p></details> |

With the rapid advancements in virtual/augmented reality, metaverse, and generative artificial intelligence, the demand for high-quality ODVs is surging. However, ODVs often suffer from low resolution due to their wide field of view and limitations in capturing devices and transmission bandwidth. Although video super-resolution (SR) is a capable video quality enhancement technique, the performance ceiling and practical generalization of existing methods are limited when applied to ODVs due to their unique attributes. To alleviate spatial projection distortions and temporal flickering of ODVs, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) with joint spatio-temporal alignment and reconstruction. Specifically, we incorporate a spatio-temporal continuous alignment (STCA) to mitigate discrete geometric artifacts in parallel with temporal alignment. Subsequently, we introduce an interlaced multi-frame reconstruction (IMFR) to enhance temporal consistency. Furthermore, we employ latitude-saliency adaptive (LSA) weights to focus on regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. By exploring a spatio-temporal jointly framework and real-world viewing strategies, STDAN effectively reinforces spatio-temporal coherence on a novel ODV-SR dataset and ensures affordable computational costs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that STDAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in improving visual fidelity and dynamic smoothness of ODVs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Forgetting and Spatio-Temporal Periodic Interest Modeling for Local-Life Service Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02451v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of the booming digital economy, recommendation systems, as a key link connecting users and numerous services, face challenges in modeling user behavior sequences on local-life service platforms, including the sparsity of long sequences and strong spatio-temporal dependence. Such challenges can be addressed by drawing an analogy to the forgetting process in human memory. This is because users' responses to recommended content follow the recency effect and the cyclicality of memory. By exploring this, this paper introduces the forgetting curve and proposes Spatio-Temporal periodic Interest Modeling (STIM) with long sequences for local-life service recommendation. STIM integrates three key components: a dynamic masking module based on the forgetting curve, which is used to extract both recent spatiotemporal features and periodic spatiotemporal features; a query-based mixture of experts (MoE) approach that can adaptively activate expert networks under different dynamic masks, enabling the collaborative modeling of time, location, and items; and a hierarchical multi-interest network unit, which captures multi-interest representations by modeling the hierarchical interactions between the shallow and deep semantics of users' recent behaviors. By introducing the STIM method, we conducted online A/B tests and achieved a 1.54\% improvement in gross transaction volume (GTV). In addition, extended offline experiments also showed improvements. STIM has been deployed in a large-scale local-life service recommendation system, serving hundreds of millions of daily active users in core application scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[DMTrack: Spatio-Temporal Multimodal Tracking via Dual-Adapter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01592v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art results. Code will be available.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Continuous Network for Stochastic 3D Human Motion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01585v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields, existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition, the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution (GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling high and low extremes with a novel dynamic spatio-temporal model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01481v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme environmental events such as severe storms, drought, heat waves, flash floods, and abrupt species collapse have become more prevalent in the earth-atmosphere dynamic system in recent years. In order to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and enhance informed decision-making, a flexible model capable of accommodating extremes is necessary. Existing dynamic spatio-temporal statistical models exhibit limitations in capturing extremes when assuming Gaussian error distributions, whereas the current models for spatial extremes mostly assume temporal independence and are focused on joint upper tails at two or more locations. Here, we introduce a new class of dynamic spatio-temporal models that capture both high and low extremes using a mixture of heavy- and light-tailed distributions with varying tail indices. Our framework flexibly identifies extremal dependence and independence in both space and time with uncertainty quantification and supports missing data prediction, as in other dynamic spatio-temporal models. We demonstrate its effectiveness using a large reanalysis dataset of hourly particulate matter in the Central United States.</p></details> |  |
| **[Point-wise Diffusion Models for Physical Systems with Shape Variations: Application to Spatio-temporal and Large-scale system](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01230v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a novel point-wise diffusion model that processes spatio-temporal points independently to efficiently predict complex physical systems with shape variations. This methodological contribution lies in applying forward and backward diffusion processes at individual spatio-temporal points, coupled with a point-wise diffusion transformer architecture for denoising. Unlike conventional image-based diffusion models that operate on structured data representations, this framework enables direct processing of any data formats including meshes and point clouds while preserving geometric fidelity. We validate our approach across three distinct physical domains with complex geometric configurations: 2D spatio-temporal systems including cylinder fluid flow and OLED drop impact test, and 3D large-scale system for road-car external aerodynamics. To justify the necessity of our point-wise approach for real-time prediction applications, we employ denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) for efficient deterministic sampling, requiring only 5-10 steps compared to traditional 1000-step and providing computational speedup of 100 to 200 times during inference without compromising accuracy. In addition, our proposed model achieves superior performance compared to image-based diffusion model: reducing training time by 94.4% and requiring 89.0% fewer parameters while achieving over 28% improvement in prediction accuracy. Comprehensive comparisons against data-flexible surrogate models including DeepONet and Meshgraphnet demonstrate consistent superiority of our approach across all three physical systems. To further refine the proposed model, we investigate two key aspects: 1) comparison of final physical states prediction or incremental change prediction, and 2) computational efficiency evaluation across varying subsampling ratios (10%-100%).</p></details> |  |
| **[HyPCV-Former: Hyperbolic Spatio-Temporal Transformer for 3D Point Cloud Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00473v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems. Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a 5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mamba-based Efficient Spatio-Frequency Motion Perception for Video Camouflaged Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23601v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage. However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally, the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2 datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23447v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS), the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However, a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network (HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1) spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .</p></details> |  |

A valuable approach to studying them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions. One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism. Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and 31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 2025 International Conference on Machine Intelligence for GeoAnalytics and Remote Sensing (MIGARS)</p></details> |

However, the complexity of data collection, classification, validation and processing result in cancer incidence figures often lagging two to three years behind the calendar year. In response, national or regional population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) are increasingly interested in methods for forecasting cancer incidence. However, in many countries there is an additional difficulty in projecting cancer incidence as regional registries are usually not established in the same year and therefore cancer incidence data series between different regions of a country are not harmonised over time. This study addresses the challenge of forecasting cancer incidence with incomplete data at both regional and national levels. To achieve our objective, we propose the use of multivariate spatio-temporal shared component models that jointly model mortality data and available cancer incidence data. The performance of these multivariate models are analyzed using lung cancer incidence data, together with the number of deaths reported in England in the period 2001-2019. Different model predictive measures have been calculated to select the best model.</p></details> | 36 pages |

However, these box annotations require tremendous human effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named \textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations. Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker} surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively.

Lastly, a method interpreting the optimized graph structure is introduced. Experiments on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset confirm superior performance over baselines such as XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, and Naive, highlighting the method's robustness, generalization, and interpretability in capturing meaningful building similarities and spatial relationships.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often struggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial, temporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this study, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware attention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike conventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal traffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based framework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and recall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within the South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic accident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78, and ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in identifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time, safety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based architecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing factors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, STARN-GAT bridges the gap between advanced graph neural network techniques and practical applications in road safety analytics.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task. This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The relevant datasets and code are available at https://github.com/ShuhaoLii/RoadDiff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Sequential Deep Operator Network and Video Diffusion: Residual Refinement of Spatio-Temporal PDE Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06133v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity. Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.</p></details> |  |
| **[IntentVCNet: Bridging Spatio-Temporal Gaps for Intention-Oriented Controllable Video Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18531v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent. Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically, we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is available on https://github.com/thqiu0419/IntentVCNet.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a hybrid spatio-temporal modeling framework that combines the interpretability and uncertainty quantification of Bayesian models -- estimated using the INLA-SPDE approach -- with the predictive power and flexibility of Random Forest (RF). Specifically, we introduce two novel algorithms, collectively named INLA-RF, which integrate a statistical spatio-temporal model with RF in an iterative two-stage framework. The first algorithm (INLA-RF1) incorporates RF predictions as an offset in the INLA-SPDE model, while the second (INLA-RF2) uses RF to directly correct selected latent field nodes. Both hybrid strategies enable uncertainty propagation between modeling stages, an aspect often overlooked in existing hybrid approaches. In addition, we propose a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based stopping criterion. We evaluate the predictive performance and uncertainty quantification capabilities of the proposed algorithms through two simulation studies. Results suggest that our hybrid approach enhances spatio-temporal prediction while maintaining interpretability and coherence in uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSDM: LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model for Service-Level Mobile Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17795v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model (LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions, showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least 8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at: https://github.com/SoftYuaneR/LSDM.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |

We propose COMPASS, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables decentralized agents to persistently monitor multiple moving targets efficiently. We model the environment as a graph, where nodes represent spatial locations and edges capture topological proximity, allowing agents to reason over structured layouts and revisit informative regions as needed. Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical observations and spatial context. We model target dynamics using Gaussian Processes (GPs), which support principled belief updates and enable uncertainty-aware planning. We train COMPASS using centralized value estimation and decentralized policy execution under an adaptive reward setting. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that COMPASS consistently outperforms strong baselines in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination efficiency across dynamic multi-target scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing GPU Memory Fragmentation via Spatio-Temporal Planning for Efficient Large-Scale Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16274v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Default GPU memory allocators of popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch use online strategies without knowledge of tensor lifespans, which can waste up to 43\% of memory and cause out-of-memory errors, rendering optimization techniques ineffective or even unusable. To address this, we introduce STWeaver, a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads. STWeaver introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a pluggable PyTorch allocator, STWeaver reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 79.2\% (up to 100\%) across both dense and sparse models, with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and improves performance by up to 32.5\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[STL-GO: Spatio-Temporal Logic with Graph Operators for Distributed Systems with Multiple Network Topologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15147v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MASs) consisting of a number of autonomous agents that communicate, coordinate, and jointly sense the environment to achieve complex missions can be found in a variety of applications such as robotics, smart cities, and internet-of-things applications. Modeling and monitoring MAS requirements to guarantee overall mission objectives, safety, and reliability is an important problem. Such requirements implicitly require reasoning about diverse sensing and communication modalities between agents, analysis of the dependencies between agent tasks, and the spatial or virtual distance between agents. To capture such rich MAS requirements, we model agent interactions via multiple directed graphs, and introduce a new logic -- Spatio-Temporal Logic with Graph Operators (STL-GO). The key innovation in STL-GO are graph operators that enable us to reason about the number of agents along either the incoming or outgoing edges of the underlying interaction graph that satisfy a given property of interest; for example, the requirement that an agent should sense at least two neighboring agents whose task graphs indicate the ability to collaborate. We then propose novel distributed monitoring conditions for individual agents that use only local information to determine whether or not an STL-GO specification is satisfied. We compare the expressivity of STL-GO against existing spatio-temporal logic formalisms, and demonstrate the utility of STL-GO and our distributed monitors in a bike-sharing and a multi-drone case study.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods rely on binary classifiers trained using real and fake image sequences, therefore hindering their generalization capabilities to unseen generation methods. Moreover, with the constant progress in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), deepfake artifacts are becoming imperceptible at both the spatial and the temporal levels, making them extremely difficult to capture. To address these issues, we propose a fine-grained deepfake video detection approach called FakeSTormer that enforces the modeling of subtle spatio-temporal inconsistencies while avoiding overfitting. Specifically, we introduce a multi-task learning framework that incorporates two auxiliary branches for explicitly attending artifact-prone spatial and temporal regions. Additionally, we propose a video-level data synthesis strategy that generates pseudo-fake videos with subtle spatio-temporal artifacts, providing high-quality samples and hand-free annotations for our additional branches. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors and inspires new compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we incorporate these spatio-temporal compressors directly into standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed primal-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring exponential convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations.

| **[DVFL-Net: A Lightweight Distilled Video Focal Modulation Network for Spatio-Temporal Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12426v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of video recognition has evolved significantly, shifting from traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Transformer-based architectures for improved accuracy. While 3D CNNs have been effective at capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this, we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance. We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR). Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical solution for real-time HAR applications.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Previous methods solve the issue of insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing approaches.

It serves as a cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction. Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF) mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of driving intention prediction.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging fine-scale weekly mortality and high-resolution climate data from Austria (2002 to 2019), we assess how interactions between temperature, humidity, age, and gender influence mortality patterns. Our approach goes beyond conventional modelling by capturing complex dependencies through structured interactions across space-time, space-age, and age-time dimensions, allowing us to capture complex demographic and environmental dependencies. The analysis identifies district-level mortality patterns and quantifies climate-related risks on a weekly basis, offering new insights for public health surveillance.</p></details> |  |

While recent efforts have explored adapting large language models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these, ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones (e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches in this field usually struggle to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in EV charging behaviors, and their limited model parameters hinder their ability to learn complex data distribution representations from large datasets. To this end, we propose a novel EV spatio-temporal large language model (EV-STLLM) for accurate prediction. Our proposed framework is divided into two modules. In the data processing module, we utilize variational mode decomposition (VMD) for data denoising, and improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) for data multi-frequency decomposition. Fuzzy information granulation (FIG) for extracting multi-scale information. Additionally, ReliefF is used for feature selection to mitigate redundancy. In the forecasting module, the EV-STLLM is used to directly achieve EV charging and occupancy forecasting. Firstly, we fully capture the intrinsic spatio-temporal characteristics of the data by integrating adjacency matrices derived from the regional stations network and spatio-temporal-frequency embedding information. Then, the partially frozen graph attention (PFGA) module is utilized to maintain the sequential feature modeling capabilities of the pre-trained large model while incorporating EV domain knowledge. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Shenzhen, China, demonstrate that our proposed framework can achieve superior accuracy and robustness compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Previous approaches typically standardized time series data before feeding it into forecasting models, but this encoding process inherently leads to a loss of important information. Moreover, past time series models generally require fixed numbers of variables or lookback window lengths, which further limits the scalability of time series forecasting. Besides, the interpretability and the uncertainty in forecasting remain areas requiring further research, as these factors directly impact the reliability and practical value of predictions. To address these issues, we first construct a diverse financial image-text dataset (FVLDB) and develop the Uncertainty-adjusted Group Relative Policy Optimization (UARPO) method to enable the model not only output predictions but also analyze the uncertainty of those predictions. We then proposed FinZero, a multimodal pre-trained model finetuned by UARPO to perform reasoning, prediction, and analytical understanding on the FVLDB financial time series. Extensive experiments validate that FinZero exhibits strong adaptability and scalability. After fine-tuning with UARPO, FinZero achieves an approximate 13.48\% improvement in prediction accuracy over GPT-4o in the high-confidence group, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning fine-tuning in multimodal large model, including in financial time series forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, a question remains: Do TSFMs succeed by memorizing patterns in training data, or do they possess the ability to reason about such patterns? While reasoning is a topic of great interest in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is undefined and largely unexplored in the context of TSFMs. In this work, inspired by language modeling literature, we formally define compositional reasoning in forecasting and distinguish it from in-distribution generalization. We evaluate the reasoning and generalization capabilities of 16 popular deep learning forecasting models on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, through controlled studies, we systematically examine which design choices in 7 popular open-source TSFMs contribute to improved reasoning capabilities. Our study yields key insights into the impact of TSFM architecture design on compositional reasoning and generalization. We find that patch-based Transformers have the best reasoning performance, closely followed by residualized MLP-based architectures, which are 97\% less computationally complex in terms of FLOPs and 86\% smaller in terms of the number of trainable parameters. Interestingly, in some zero-shot out-of-distribution scenarios, these models can outperform moving average and exponential smoothing statistical baselines trained on in-distribution data. Only a few design choices, such as the tokenization method, had a significant (negative) impact on Transformer model performance.</p></details> |  |

Our approach encodes complex quantum network dynamics, including entanglement degradation and time-varying channel noise, into a low-dimensional feature space, enabling efficient belief updates and scalable policy learning. The core of our framework is a hybrid GNN-POMDP architecture that processes graph-structured representations of entangled links to learn routing policies, coupled with a noise-adaptive mechanism that fuses POMDP belief updates with GNN outputs for robust decision making. We provide a theoretical analysis establishing guarantees for belief convergence, policy improvement, and robustness to noise. Experiments on simulated quantum networks with up to 100 nodes demonstrate significant improvements in routing fidelity and entanglement delivery rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under high decoherence and nonstationary conditions.</p></details> |  |

By introducing an additional variable, we construct an equivalent system where the operator is a Lipschitz continuous mapping from a Hilbert space $Y \times X$ to its dual, with a Lipschitz continuous inverse. Resulting Galerkin discretizations can be solved with an inexact Uzawa type algorithm. Quasi-optimality of the Galerkin approximations is guaranteed under an inf-sup condition on the selected `test' and `trial' subspaces of $Y$ and $X$. To circumvent the restriction imposed by this inf-sup condition, an a posteriori condition for quasi-optimality is developed that is shown to be satisfied whenever the test space is sufficiently large.</p></details> | 24 pages |
| **[Visual Analysis of Time-Dependent Observables in Cell Signaling Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08589v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of a cell to communicate with its environment is essential for key cellular functions like replication, metabolism, or cell fate decisions. The involved molecular mechanisms are highly dynamic and difficult to capture experimentally. Simulation studies offer a valuable means for exploring and predicting how cell signaling processes unfold. We present a design study on the visual analysis of such studies to support 1) modelers in calibrating model parameters such that the simulated signal responses over time reflect reference behavior from cell biology research and 2) cell biologists in exploring the influence of receptor trafficking on the efficiency of signal transmission within the cell. We embed time series plots into parallel coordinates to enable a simultaneous analysis of model parameters and temporal outputs. A usage scenario illustrates how our approach assists with typical tasks such as assessing the plausibility of temporal outputs or their sensitivity across model configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subset Sum in Near-Linear Pseudopolynomial Time and Polynomial Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04726v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a multiset $A = \{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ of positive integers and a target integer $t$, the Subset Sum problem asks if there is a subset of $A$ that sums to $t$. Bellman's [1957] classical dynamic programming algorithm runs in $O(nt)$ time and $O(t)$ space. Since then, much work has been done to reduce both the time and space usage. Notably, Bringmann [SODA 2017] uses a two-step color-coding technique to obtain a randomized algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(n+t)$ time and $\tilde{O}(t)$ space. Jin, Vyas and Williams [SODA 2021] build upon the algorithm given by Bringmann, using a clever algebraic trick first seen in Kane's Logspace algorithm, to obtain an $\tilde{O}(nt)$ time and $\tilde{O}(\log(nt))$ space randomized algorithm. A SETH-based lower-bound established by Abboud et al. [SODA 2019] shows that Bringmann's algorithm is likely to have near-optimal time complexity. We build on the techniques used by Jin et al. to obtain a randomized algorithm running in $\tilde{O}(n+t)$ time and $\tilde{O}(n^2 + n \log^2 t)$ space, resulting in an algorithm with near-optimal runtime that also runs in polynomial space. We use a multipoint evaluation-based approach to speed up a bottleneck step in their algorithm. We also provide a simple polynomial space deterministic algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(n^2t)$ time and $\tilde{O}(n \log^2 t)$ space.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages; v2: correction in the deterministic algorithm, main randomized algorithm unchanged</p></details> |
| **[Real-time CBCT reconstructions using Krylov solvers in repeated scanning procedures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08574v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a new efficient iterative solver for the reconstruction of real-time cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), which is based on the Prior Image Constrained Compressed Sensing (PICCS) regularization and leverages the efficiency of Krylov subspace methods. In particular, we focus on the setting where a sequence of under-sampled CT scans are taken on the same object with only local changes (e.g. changes in a tumour size or the introduction of a surgical tool). This is very common, for example, in image-guided surgery, where the amount of measurements is limited to ensure the safety of the patient. In this case, we can also typically assume that a (good) initial reconstruction for the solution exists, coming from a previously over-sampled scan, so we can use this information to aid the subsequent reconstructions. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated in both a synthetic scan and using real CT data, where it can be observed that the PICCS framework is very effective for the reduction of artifacts, and that the new method is faster than other common alternatives used in the same setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRMAC: A Time-Reversal-based MAC Protocol for Wireless Networks within Computing Packages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19487v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As chiplet-based integration and many-core architectures become the norm in high-performance computing, on-chip wireless communication has emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional interconnects. However, scalable Medium Access Control (MAC) remains a fundamental challenge, particularly under dense traffic and limited spectral resources. This paper presents TRMAC, a novel cross-layer MAC protocol that exploits the spatial focusing capability of Time Reversal (TR) to enable multiple parallel transmissions over a shared frequency channel. By leveraging the quasi-deterministic nature of on-chip wireless channels, TRMAC pre-characterizes channel impulse responses to coordinate access using energy-based thresholds, eliminating the need for orthogonal resource allocation or centralized arbitration. Through detailed physical-layer simulation and system-level evaluation on diverse traffic, TRMAC demonstrates comparable or superior performance to existing multi-channel MAC protocols, achieving low latency, high throughput, and strong scalability across hundreds of cores. TRMAC provides a low-complexity, high-efficiency solution for future Wireless Networks-on-Chip (WNoCs), particularly in chiplet-based systems where spatial reuse and modularity are critical. With simulations we prove that TRMAC can be utilized for parallel transmissions with a single frequency channel with a similar throughput and latency as in using multiple frequency bands omitting the need for complex transceivers. This work establishes a new design direction for MAC protocols that are tightly integrated with the underlying channel physics to meet the demands of next-generation computing platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[A posteriori error analysis and adaptivity of a space-time finite element method for the wave equation in second order formulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08537v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We establish rigorous \emph{a posteriori} error bounds for a space-time finite element method of arbitrary order discretising linear wave problems in second order formulation. The method combines standard finite elements in space and continuous piecewise polynomials in time with an upwind discontinuous Galerkin-type approximation for the second temporal derivative. The proposed scheme accepts dynamic mesh modification, as required by space-time adaptive algorithms, resulting in a discontinuous temporal discretisation when mesh changes occur. We prove \emph{a posteriori} error bounds in the $L^\infty(L^2)$-norm, using carefully designed temporal and spatial reconstructions; explicit control on the constants (including the spatial and temporal orders of the method) in those error bounds is shown. The convergence behaviour of an error estimator is verified numerically, also taking into account the effect of the mesh change. A space-time adaptive algorithm is proposed and tested numerically.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real Time Semantic Segmentation of High Resolution Automotive LiDAR Scans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21602v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent studies, numerous previous works emphasize the importance of semantic segmentation of LiDAR data as a critical component to the development of driver-assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. However, many state-of-the-art methods are tested on outdated, lower-resolution LiDAR sensors and struggle with real-time constraints. This study introduces a novel semantic segmentation framework tailored for modern high-resolution LiDAR sensors that addresses both accuracy and real-time processing demands. We propose a novel LiDAR dataset collected by a cutting-edge automotive 128 layer LiDAR in urban traffic scenes. Furthermore, we propose a semantic segmentation method utilizing surface normals as strong input features. Our approach is bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical automotive applications. Additionaly, we provide a Robot Operating System (ROS2) implementation that we operate on our research vehicle.

To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door", "approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper", etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |

Existing color-correction methods often rely on prior clinical diagnosis and static filtering, making them less effective for users with mild or moderate CVD. In this paper, we introduce Hue4U, a personalized, real-time color-correction system in augmented reality using consumer-grade Meta Quest headsets. Unlike previous methods, Hue4U requires no prior medical diagnosis and adapts to the user in real time. A user study with 10 participants showed notable improvements in their ability to distinguish colors. The results demonstrated large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 1.4), suggesting clinically meaningful gains for individuals with CVD. These findings highlight the potential of personalized AR interventions to improve visual accessibility and quality of life for people affected by CVD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Distribution Shifts: Adaptive Hyperspectral Image Classification at Test Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08436v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise, blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme. Code will be made available publicly.</p></details> |  |

To balance the trade-off between energy and execution latency, and thus accommodate different demands and application scenarios, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize a weighted sum of total energy consumption and completion time through two weight parameters. The optimization variables include bandwidth, transmission power and CPU frequency of each device in the FL system, where all devices are linked to a base station and train a global model collaboratively. Through decomposing the non-convex optimization problem into two subproblems, we devise a resource allocation algorithm to determine the bandwidth allocation, transmission power, and CPU frequency for each participating device. We further present the convergence analysis and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm not only has better performance at different weight parameters (i.e., different demands) but also outperforms the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper appears in the Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS) 2022.

| **[AP-observation Automata for Abstraction-based Verification of Continuous-time Systems (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08343v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key challenge in abstraction-based verification and control under complex specifications such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is that abstract models retain significantly less information than their original systems. This issue is especially true for continuous-time systems, where the system state trajectories are split into intervals of discrete actions, and satisfaction of atomic propositions is abstracted to a whole time interval. To tackle this challenge, this work introduces a novel translation from LTL specifications to AP-observation automata, a particular type of B\"uchi automata specifically designed for abstraction-based verification. Based on this automaton, we present a game-based verification algorithm played between the system and the environment, and an illustrative example for abstraction-based system verification under several LTL specifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of the paper under the same title accepted for presentation at the 22nd International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of Computing (ICTAC 2025)</p></details> |

A novel distributed resilient adaptive fixed-time control strategy is proposed, which consists of a novel distributed resilient fixed-time observer with a chain of nonlinear filters and a novel distributed resilient adaptive fixed-time controller. It is shown that the problem of resilient global practical fixed-time cooperative output regulation can be solved by the proposed control strategy. More specifically, the proposed {distributed} control strategy ensures the global boundedness of all the signals in the resulting closed-loop system and the global convergence of the regulated outputs to a {tunable} residual set in a fixed time. A simulation example is finally provided to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed control strategy.</p></details> |  |

Numer. Math., 31(1):59--77, 2023] for a parabolic-parabolic interface problem and prove estimates for the discrete time derivatives of the scalar field in different norms. When the interface is flat and perpendicular to two of the edges of the domain we prove error estimates in the $H^2$-norm. Such estimates are key ingredients to analyze a defect correction method for the parabolic-parabolic interface problem. Numerical results are shown to support our findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample-Efficient Online Control Policy Learning with Real-Time Recursive Model Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08241v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven control methods need to be sample-efficient and lightweight, especially when data acquisition and computational resources are limited -- such as during learning on hardware. Most modern data-driven methods require large datasets and struggle with real-time updates of models, limiting their performance in dynamic environments. Koopman theory formally represents nonlinear systems as linear models over observables, and Koopman representations can be determined from data in an optimization-friendly setting with potentially rapid model updates. In this paper, we present a highly sample-efficient, Koopman-based learning pipeline: Recursive Koopman Learning (RKL). We identify sufficient conditions for model convergence and provide formal algorithmic analysis supporting our claim that RKL is lightweight and fast, with complexity independent of dataset size. We validate our method on a simulated planar two-link arm and a hybrid nonlinear hardware system with soft actuators, showing that real-time recursive Koopman model updates improve the sample efficiency and stability of data-driven controller synthesis -- requiring only <10% of the data compared to benchmarks. The high-performance C++ codebase is open-sourced. Website: https://www.zixinatom990.com/home/robotics/corl-2025-recursive-koopman-learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparative Analysis of Global and Local Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting for Contiguous Spatial Demand Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08214v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluates three probabilistic forecasting strategies using LightGBM: global pooling, cluster-level pooling, and station-level modeling across a range of scenarios, from fully homogeneous simulated data to highly heterogeneous real-world Divvy bike-share demand observed during 2023 to 2024. Clustering was performed using the K-means algorithm applied to principal component analysis transformed covariates, which included time series features, counts of nearby transportation infrastructure, and local demographic characteristics. Forecasting performance was assessed using prediction interval coverage probability (PICP), normalized interval width (PINAW), and the mean squared error (MSE) of the median forecast. The results show that global LightGBM models incorporating station identifiers consistently outperform both cluster-level and station-level models across most scenarios. These global models effectively leverage the full cross-sectional dataset while enabling local adjustments through the station identifier, resulting in superior prediction interval coverage, sharper intervals, and lower forecast errors. In contrast, cluster-based models often suffer from residual within group heterogeneity, leading to degraded accuracy. Station-level models capture fine-grained local dynamics in heterogeneous settings. These findings underscore that global LightGBM models with embedded station identifiers provide a robust, scalable, and computationally efficient framework for transportation demand forecasting. By balancing global structure with local specificity, this approach offers a practical and effective solution for real-world mobility applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

In this research, three end-to-end Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were trained and evaluated offline and deployed on a differential-drive mobile robot for real-time obstacle avoidance to generate low-level steering commands from synchronized color and depth images acquired by an Intel RealSense D415 RGB-D camera in diverse environments. Offline evaluation showed that the NetConEmb model achieved the best performance with a notably low MedAE of $0.58 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s. In comparison, the lighter NetEmb architecture adopted in this study, which reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 25\% and converges faster, produced comparable results with an RMSE of $21.68 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s, close to the $21.42 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s obtained by NetConEmb. Real-time navigation further confirmed NetConEmb's robustness, achieving a 100\% success rate in both known and unknown environments, while NetEmb and NetGated succeeded only in navigating the known environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convergence of Momentum-Based Optimization Algorithms with Time-Varying Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11904v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a unified algorithm for stochastic optimization that makes use of a "momentum" term; in other words, the stochastic gradient depends not only on the current true gradient of the objective function, but also on the true gradient at the previous iteration. Our formulation includes the Stochastic Heavy Ball (SHB) and the Stochastic Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (SNAG) algorithms as special cases. In addition, in our formulation, the momentum term is allowed to vary as a function of time (i.e., the iteration counter). The assumptions on the stochastic gradient are the most general in the literature, in that it can be biased, and have a conditional variance that grows in an unbounded fashion as a function of time. This last feature is crucial in order to make the theory applicable to "zero-order" methods, where the gradient is estimated using just two function evaluations. We present a set of sufficient conditions for the convergence of the unified algorithm. These conditions are natural generalizations of the familiar Robbins-Monro and Kiefer-Wolfowitz-Blum conditions for standard stochastic gradient descent. We also analyze another method from the literature for the SHB algorithm with a time-varying momentum parameter, and show that it is impracticable.</p></details> | 36 pages |
| **[Clustering methods for Categorical Time Series and Sequences : A scoping review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07885v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: To provide an overview of clustering methods for categorical time series (CTS), a data structure commonly found in epidemiology, sociology, biology, and marketing, and to support method selection in regards to data characteristics. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, from inception up to November 2024 to identify articles that propose and evaluate clustering techniques for CTS. Methods were classified according to three major families -- distance-based, feature-based, and model-based -- and assessed on their ability to handle data challenges such as variable sequence length, multivariate data, continuous time, missing data, time-invariant covariates, and large data volumes. Results: Out of 14607 studies, we included 124 articles describing 129 methods, spanning domains such as artificial intelligence, social sciences, and epidemiology. Distance-based methods, particularly those using Optimal Matching, were most prevalent, with 56 methods. We identified 28 model-based methods, which demonstrated superior flexibility for handling complex data structures such as multivariate data, continuous time and time-invariant covariates. We also recorded 45 feature-based approaches, which were on average more scalable but less flexible. A searchable Web application was developed to facilitate method selection based on dataset characteristics ( https://cts-clustering-scoping-review-7sxqj3sameqvmwkvnzfynz.streamlit.app/ ) Discussion: While distance-based methods dominate, model-based approaches offer the richest modeling potential but are less scalable. Feature-based methods favor performance over flexibility, with limited support for complex data structures. Conclusion: This review highlights methodological diversity and gaps in CTS clustering. The proposed typology aims to guide researchers in selecting appropriate methods for their specific use cases.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on daily and monthly open-source intelligence (OSINT) data from WarSpotting, we aim to assess trends in attrition, evaluate model performance, and estimate future loss patterns through the end of 2025. Our findings show that deep learning models, particularly TCN and LSTM, produce stable and consistent forecasts, especially under conditions of high temporal granularity. By comparing different model architectures and input structures, this study highlights the importance of ensemble forecasting in conflict modeling, and the value of publicly available OSINT data in quantifying material degradation over time.</p></details> |  |

However, its computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

The phenomenal work of Engle and Granger in 1987 and Johansen in 1988 has paved the way for the most commonly used cointegration tests so far. Even though cointegrating relationships focus on long-term behaviour and correlation of multiple nonstationary time series, oftentimes we encounter statistical data with limited sample sizes and other information. Thus other tests with empirical advantages may also be of considerable importance. In this paper, we provide an optimisation approach motivated by the Blind Source Separation, or also known as Independent Component Analysis, for cointegration between financial time series. Two methods for cointegration tests are introduced, namely decorrelation for the bivariate case and maximisation of nongaussianity for higher-dimensions. We highlight the empirical preponderances of independent components and also the computational simplicity, compared to common practices of cointegration such as the Johansen's Cointegration Test. The advantages of our methods, especially the better performances in limited sample size, enable a wider range of application and accessibility for researchers and practitioners to identify cointegrating relationships.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the inherently unstable and unpredictable nature of LLM outputs, they may issue unintended tool commands or incorrect inputs, leading to potentially harmful operations. Unlike traditional security risks stemming from insecure user prompts, tool execution results from LLM-driven decisions introduce new and unique security challenges. These vulnerabilities span across all components of a computer-use agent. To mitigate these risks, we propose AgentSentinel, an end-to-end, real-time defense framework designed to mitigate potential security threats on a user's computer. AgentSentinel intercepts all sensitive operations within agent-related services and halts execution until a comprehensive security audit is completed. Our security auditing mechanism introduces a novel inspection process that correlates the current task context with system traces generated during task execution. To thoroughly evaluate AgentSentinel, we present BadComputerUse, a benchmark consisting of 60 diverse attack scenarios across six attack categories. The benchmark demonstrates a 87% average attack success rate on four state-of-the-art LLMs. Our evaluation shows that AgentSentinel achieves an average defense success rate of 79.6%, significantly outperforming all baseline defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[IBN: An Interpretable Bidirectional-Modeling Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Variable Missing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07725v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN), integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling. Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables.

The control law of each individual agent relies only on information from neighboring agents and is updated at discrete intervals determined by state-dependent triggering functions, reducing the frequency of agent interactions. To this end, first, the controller is augmented with a time-varying gain. Then, the dynamics of the closed-loop system over the finite-time interval is transformed into an infinite-time frame using time scaling. Lyapunov-based analysis is employed to derive suitable triggering conditions that guarantee the asymptotic convergence of the time-transformed system, thereby ensuring the prescribed-time convergence of the original system.</p></details> | 11 pages |

A Survey on Verification Design for Test-time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16665v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a new frontier for scaling the performance of Large Language Models. In test-time scaling, by using more computational resources during inference, LLMs can improve their reasoning process and task performance. Several approaches have emerged for TTS such as distilling reasoning traces from another model or exploring the vast decoding search space by employing a verifier. The verifiers serve as reward models that help score the candidate outputs from the decoding process to diligently explore the vast solution space and select the best outcome. This paradigm commonly termed has emerged as a superior approach owing to parameter free scaling at inference time and high performance gains. The verifiers could be prompt-based, fine-tuned as a discriminative or generative model to verify process paths, outcomes or both. Despite their widespread adoption, there is no detailed collection, clear categorization and discussion of diverse verification approaches and their training mechanisms. In this survey, we cover the diverse approaches in the literature and present a unified view of verifier training, types and their utility in test-time scaling.

Specifically, we consider the task of constructing a binary linear code $C \leq \mathcal{F}_2^n$ such that both it and its dual $C^\perp :=\{x \in \mathcal{F}_2^n:\forall c \in C, \langle x,c\rangle=0\}$ are asymptotically good (in fact, have rate-distance tradeoff approaching the GV bound), and are encodable in $O(n)$ time. While we believe such codes should find applications more broadly, as motivation we describe how such codes can be used the secure computation task of encrypted matrix-vector product, as studied by Behhamouda et al (CCS 2025, to appear). Our main contribution is a construction of such a fast good code with fast good dual. Our construction is inspired by the repeat multiple accumulate (RMA) codes of Divsalar, Jin and McEliece (Allerton, 1998). To create the rate 1/2 code, after repeating each message coordinate, we perform accumulation steps -- where first a uniform coordinate permutation is applied, and afterwards the prefix-sum mod 2 is applied -- which are alternated with discrete derivative steps -- where again a uniform coordinate permutation is applied, and afterwards the previous two coordinates are summed mod 2. Importantly, these two operations are inverse of each other. In particular, the dual of the code is very similar, with the accumulation and discrete derivative steps reversed. Our analysis is inspired by a prior analysis of RMA codes due to Ravazzi and Fagnani (IEEE Trans. Info. Theory, 2009). The main idea is to bound the input-output weight-enumerator function: the expected number of messages of a given weight that are encoded into a codeword of a given weight. We face new challenges in controlling the behaviour of the discrete derivative matrix (which can significantly drop the weight of a vector), which we overcome by careful case analysis.</p></details> | 40 pages |
| **[Influence Maximization Considering Influence, Cost and Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07625v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Influence maximization has been studied for social network analysis, such as viral marketing (advertising), rumor prevention, and opinion leader identification. However, most studies neglect the interplay between influence spread, cost efficiency, and temporal urgency. In practical scenarios such as viral marketing and information campaigns, jointly optimizing Influence, Cost, and Time is essential, yet remaining largely unaddressed in current literature. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes a new multi-objective influence maximization problem that simultaneously optimizes influence, cost, and time. We show the intuitive and empirical evidence to prove the feasibility and necessity of this multi-objective problem. We also develop an evolutionary variable-length search algorithm that can effectively search for optimal node combinations. The proposed EVEA algorithm outperforms all baselines, achieving up to 19.3% higher hypervolume and 25 to 40% faster convergence across four real-world networks, while maintaining a diverse and balanced Pareto front among influence, cost, and time objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring System Adaptations For Minimum Latency Real-Time Piano Transcription](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07586v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in neural network design and the availability of large-scale labeled datasets have driven major improvements in piano transcription. Existing approaches target either offline applications, with no restrictions on computational demands, or online transcription, with delays of 128-320 ms. However, most real-time musical applications require latencies below 30 ms. In this work, we investigate whether and how the current state-of-the-art online transcription model can be adapted for real-time piano transcription. Specifically, we eliminate all non-causal processing, and reduce computational load through shared computations across core model components and variations in model size. Additionally, we explore different pre- and postprocessing strategies, and related label encoding schemes, and discuss their suitability for real-time transcription. Evaluating the adaptions on the MAESTRO dataset, we find a drop in transcription accuracy due to strictly causal processing as well as a tradeoff between the preprocessing latency and prediction accuracy. We release our system as a baseline to support researchers in designing models towards minimum latency real-time transcription.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in Proceedings of the 26th International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) Conference 2025, Daejeon, South Korea</p></details> |
| **[Real-Time Gradient Waveform Design for Arbitrary $k$-Space Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21625v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>\textbf{Objective: }To develop a real-time method for designing gradient waveforms for arbitrary $k$-space trajectories that are time-optimal and hardware-compliant. \textbf{Methods: }The gradient waveform is solved recursively under both the slew-rate and the trajectory constraints. The gradient constraint is enforced by thresholding the $\ell_2$-norm of the next gradient vector. The constraints form a quadratic equation. To ensure the existence of the solution, a novel Discrete-Time Forward and Backward Sweep (DTFBS) strategy is proposed. To ensure the existence of the trajectory derivatives, the trajectory function is reparameterized as a piecewise cubic polynomial function with $C^2$ continuity. To ensure trajectory fidelity, the output gradient waveform is reparameterized by the finite difference of the trajectory samples. Simulation experiments across seven commonly adopted non-Cartesian trajectories were conducted to validate generality, time-optimality, real-time capability, slew-rate accuracy, and improvements over prior work. Imaging feasibility of the designed time-optimal gradient waveform was validated in phantom and in vivo experiments. \textbf{Results: }The proposed method achieves a $>89\%$ reduction in computation time and simultaneously reduces slew-rate overshoot by $>98\%$ compared to the prior method across all involved trajectories. The computation time of the proposed method is shorter than the gradient duration for all tested cases, validating the real-time capability of the proposed method. \textbf{Conclusions: }The proposed method enables real-time and hardware-compliant gradient waveform design, achieving significant reductions in computation time and slew-rate overshoot compared to the previous method. \textbf{Significance: }This is the first method achieving real-time gradient waveform design for arbitrary $k$-space trajectories.</p></details> |  |

Recently, training-based TTS methods, such as continued reinforcement learning (RL), have further surged in popularity, while training-free TTS methods are gradually fading from prominence. However, the additional computation overhead of training amplifies the burden on test-time scaling. In this paper, we focus on training-free TTS methods for reasoning. We first design Conditional Step-level Self-refinement, a fine-grained sequential scaling method guided by process verification. On top of its effectiveness, we further combine it with other classical parallel scaling methods at the step level, to introduce a novel inference paradigm called Hybrid Test-Time Scaling. Extensive experiments on five instruction-tuned LLMs across different scales (3B-14B) and families demonstrate that hybrid strategy incorporating various training-free TTS methods at a fine granularity has considerable potential for expanding the reasoning performance boundaries of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025.

Accurately identifying the moments when unexpected errors or defects occur is essential, yet challenging due to scarce labels, unknown anomaly types, and complex correlations across dimensions. To address the scarcity and unreliability of labelled data, we use the Lorenzetti Simulator to generate synthetic events with injected calorimeter anomalies. We then assess the sensitivity of several time series anomaly detection methods, including transformer-based and other deep learning models. The approach employed here is generic and applicable to different detector designs and defects.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, Submission to SciPost proceedings for EuCAIFCon 2025</p></details> |
| **[Timing the Message: Language-Based Notifications for Time-Critical Assistive Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07438v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time-critical settings such as assistive driving, assistants often rely on alerts or haptic signals to prompt rapid human attention, but these cues usually leave humans to interpret situations and decide responses independently, introducing potential delays or ambiguity in meaning. Language-based assistive systems can instead provide instructions backed by context, offering more informative guidance. However, current approaches (e.g., social assistive robots) largely prioritize content generation while overlooking critical timing factors such as verbal conveyance duration, human comprehension delays, and subsequent follow-through duration. These timing considerations are crucial in time-critical settings, where even minor delays can substantially affect outcomes. We aim to study this inherent trade-off between timeliness and informativeness by framing the challenge as a sequential decision-making problem using an augmented-state Markov Decision Process. We design a framework combining reinforcement learning and a generated offline taxonomy dataset, where we balance the trade-off while enabling a scalable taxonomy dataset generation pipeline. Empirical evaluation with synthetic humans shows our framework improves success rates by over 40% compared to methods that ignore time delays, while effectively balancing timeliness and informativeness. It also exposes an often-overlooked trade-off between these two factors, opening new directions for optimizing communication in time-critical human-AI assistance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential Change-point Detection for Compositional Time Series with Exogenous Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18130v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential change-point detection for time series enables us to sequentially check the hypothesis that the model still holds as more and more data are observed. It is widely used in data monitoring in practice. In this work, we consider sequential change-point detection for compositional time series, time series in which the observations are proportions. For fitting compositional time series, we propose a generalized Beta AR(1) model, which can incorporate exogenous variables upon which the time series observations are dependent. We show the compositional time series are strictly stationary and geometrically ergodic and consider maximum likelihood estimation for model parameters. We show the partial MLEs are consistent and asymptotically normal and propose a parametric sequential change-point detection method for the compositional time series model. The change-point detection method is illustrated using a time series of Covid-19 positivity rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Highly Efficient Direct Analytics on Semantic-aware Time Series Data Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13246v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm to tackle the challenges of massive growing data traffic and sustainable data communication. It shifts the focus from data fidelity to goal-oriented or task-oriented semantic transmission. While deep learning-based methods are commonly used for semantic encoding and decoding, they struggle with the sequential nature of time series data and high computation cost, particularly in resource-constrained IoT environments. Data compression plays a crucial role in reducing transmission and storage costs, yet traditional data compression methods fall short of the demands of goal-oriented communication systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for direct analytics on time series data compressed by the SHRINK compression algorithm. Through experimentation using outlier detection as a case study, we show that our method outperforms baselines running on uncompressed data in multiple cases, with merely 1% difference in the worst case. Additionally, it achieves four times lower runtime on average and accesses approximately 10% of the data volume, which enables edge analytics with limited storage and computation power. These results demonstrate that our approach offers reliable, high-speed outlier detection analytics for diverse IoT applications while extracting semantics from time-series data, achieving high compression, and reducing data transmission.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of arXiv:2503.13246, with significant additional contributions</p></details> |

This paper extends Schneider et al.'s foundational EVRP-TW model with arc-based dynamic wireless charging representation, partial coverage modeling, and hierarchical multi-objective optimization prioritizing fleet minimization. Computational experiments on Schneider benchmark instances demonstrate substantial operational benefits, with distance and time improvements ranging from 0.7% to 35.9% in secondary objective components. Analysis reveals that 20% wireless coverage achieves immediate benefits, while 60% coverage delivers optimal performance across all test instances for infrastructure investment decisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Privacy Preservation and Reducing Analysis Time with Federated Transfer Learning in Digital Twins-based Computed Tomography Scan Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08018v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Digital Twin (DT) technology and Federated Learning (FL) has great potential to change the field of biomedical image analysis, particularly for Computed Tomography (CT) scans. This paper presents Federated Transfer Learning (FTL) as a new Digital Twin-based CT scan analysis paradigm. FTL uses pre-trained models and knowledge transfer between peer nodes to solve problems such as data privacy, limited computing resources, and data heterogeneity. The proposed framework allows real-time collaboration between cloud servers and Digital Twin-enabled CT scanners while protecting patient identity. We apply the FTL method to a heterogeneous CT scan dataset and assess model performance using convergence time, model accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix. It has been shown to perform better than conventional FL and Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) methods with better precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score. The technique is beneficial in settings where the data is not independently and identically distributed (non-IID), and it offers reliable, efficient, and secure solutions for medical diagnosis. These findings highlight the possibility of using FTL to improve decision-making in digital twin-based CT scan analysis, secure and efficient medical image analysis, promote privacy, and open new possibilities for applying precision medicine and smart healthcare systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent large language models (LLMs) have boosted performance by scaling test-time computation through long chain-of-thought reasoning. However, transformer-based models are inherently limited in extending context length due to their quadratic computational complexity and linear memory requirements. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid linear RNN reasoning model, M1, built on the Mamba architecture, which allows memory-efficient inference. Our approach leverages a distillation process from existing reasoning models and is further enhanced through RL training. Experimental results on the AIME and MATH benchmarks show that M1 not only outperforms previous linear RNN models but also matches the performance of state-of-the-art Deepseek R1 distilled reasoning models at a similar scale. We also compare our generation speed with a highly performant general purpose inference engine, vLLM, and observe more than a 3x speedup compared to a same size transformer. With throughput speedup, we are able to achieve higher accuracy compared to DeepSeek R1 distilled transformer reasoning models under a fixed generation time budget using self-consistency voting. Overall, we introduce a hybrid Mamba reasoning model and provide a more effective approach to scaling test-time generation using self-consistency or long chain of thought reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available https://github.com/jxiw/M1</p></details> |

Given an appropriate prior on the temporal behavior of signals, our proposed method can estimate time-varying graphs from a small number of available measurements. To achieve this, we introduce two regularization terms in convex optimization problems that constrain sparseness of temporal variations of the time-varying networks. Moreover, a computationally-scalable algorithm is introduced to efficiently solve the optimization problem. The experimental results with synthetic and real datasets (point cloud and temperature data) demonstrate our proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |
| **[FedTeddi: Temporal Drift and Divergence Aware Scheduling for Timely Federated Edge Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07342v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients over wireless networks without exposing raw data. While most existing studies assume static datasets, in real-world scenarios clients may continuously collect data with time-varying and non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. A critical challenge is how to adapt models in a timely yet efficient manner to such evolving data. In this paper, we propose FedTeddi, a temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware scheduling algorithm that facilitates fast convergence of FEEL under dynamic data evolution and communication resource limits. We first quantify the temporal dynamics and non-i.i.d. characteristics of data using temporal drift and collective divergence, respectively, and represent them as the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) of class distributions for classification tasks. We then propose a novel optimization objective and develop a joint scheduling and bandwidth allocation algorithm, enabling the FEEL system to learn from new data quickly without forgetting previous knowledge. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence compared to benchmark methods, improving the rate of convergence by 58.4% on CIFAR-10 and 49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Simultaneously, extensive research has explored the interplay between collaborative perception and decision-making in end-to-end driving frameworks. In this work, we revisit the collaborative driving problem and propose the Select2Drive framework to optimize the utilization of limited computational and communication resources. Particularly, to mitigate cumulative latency in perception and decision-making, Select2Drive introduces distributed predictive perception by formulating an active prediction paradigm and simplifying high-dimensional semantic feature prediction into a computation cost-efficient, motion-aware reconstruction. Given the ``less is more" principle that an over-broadened perceptual horizon possibly confuses the decision module rather than contributing to it, Select2Drive utilizes area-of-importance-based PragComm to prioritize the communications of critical regions, thus boosting both communication efficiency and decision-making efficacy. Empirical evaluations on the V2Xverse and real-world DAIR-V2X demonstrate that Select2Drive achieves a $2.60$\% and $1.99$\% improvement in offline perception tasks under limited bandwidth (resp., pose error conditions). Moreover, it delivers at most $8.35$\% and $2.65$\% enhancement in closed-loop driving scores and route completion rates, particularly in scenarios characterized by dense traffic and high-speed dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Double Machine Learning for Estimating Time-Varying Delayed and Instantaneous Effects Using Digital Phenotypes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07322v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile health (mHealth) leverages digital technologies, such as mobile phones, to capture objective, frequent, and real-world digital phenotypes from individuals, enabling the delivery of tailored interventions to accommodate substantial between-subject and temporal heterogeneity. However, evaluating heterogeneous treatment effects from digital phenotype data is challenging due to the dynamic nature of treatments and the presence of delayed effects that extend beyond immediate responses. Additionally, modeling observational data is complicated by confounding factors. To address these challenges, we propose a double machine learning (DML) method designed to estimate both time-varying instantaneous and delayed treatment effects using digital phenotypes. Our approach uses a sequential procedure to estimate the treatment effects based on a DML estimator to ensure Neyman orthogonality. We establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator. Extensive simulation studies validate the finite-sample performance of our approach, demonstrating the advantages of DML and the decomposition of treatment effects. We apply our method to an mHealth study on Parkinson's disease (PD), where we find that the treatment is significantly more effective for younger PD patients and maintains greater stability over time for individuals with low motor fluctuations. These findings demonstrate the utility of our proposed method in advancing precision medicine in mHealth studies.</p></details> |  |

The approach uses repulsive potential functions to ensure agent-agent and obstacle safety, while neural network estimators compensate for system uncertainties and disturbances. A high-order control barrier function framework is then employed to certify the positive invariance of the safe sets and the boundedness of the proposed control inputs. The resulting distributed control and adaptive laws, together with dwell-time requirements for topology transitions, achieve leader-following consensus. This integrated design provides synchronized formation and robust disturbance rejection in evolving network configurations, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through numerical simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Joint...</summary><p>Joint submission paper MECC-JDSMC.

We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) integrated with a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning framework for improved interference coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static priorities, our approach dynamically learns link priorities based on real-time traffic demand, network topology, remaining transmission opportunities, and interference patterns. The GCN captures spatial dependencies, while the DQN enables adaptive scheduling decisions through reward-guided exploration. Simulation results show that our GCN-DQN model achieves mean SINR improvements of 179.6\%, 197.4\%, and 175.2\% over LDP across three network configurations. Additionally, the GCN-DQN model demonstrates mean SINR improvements of 31.5\%, 53.0\%, and 84.7\% over our previous CNN-based approach across the same configurations. These results underscore the effectiveness of our GCN-DQN model in addressing complex URLLC requirements with minimal overhead and superior network performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2506.14987</p></details> |

Classical self-normalization relies on the factorization of a constant long-run variance and a stochastic factor. In this case, the CUSUM statistic can be divided by another statistic proportional to the long-run variance, so that the latter cancels. Thereby, a tedious estimation of the long-run variance can be avoided. Under local stationarity, the partial sum process converges to $\int_0^t \sigma(x) d B_x$ and no such factorization is possible. To overcome this obstacle, a self-normalized test statistic is constructed from a carefully designed bivariate partial-sum process. Weak convergence of the process is proven, and it is shown that the resulting self-normalized test attains asymptotic level $\alpha$ under the null hypothesis of no change, while being consistent against a broad class of alternatives. Extensive simulations demonstrate better finite-sample properties compared to existing methods. Applications to real data illustrate the method's practical effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Change point analysis, gradual changes, local stationarity, self-normalization, CUSUM test Info: 42 pages, 4 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric, enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference, we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic scenarios.</p></details> | WACV 2026 Accepted |

In particular, we work with data in which only the total count of units in a system at a given time point is observed, but the underlying process of inflows, length of stay and outflows is not. The particular data example looked at in this paper is the occupancy of intensive care units (ICU) during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the aggregated numbers of occupied beds in ICUs on the district level (`Landkreis') are recorded, but not the number of incoming and outgoing patients. The Skellam distribution allows us to infer the number of incoming and outgoing patients from the occupancy in the ICUs. This paper goes a step beyond and approaches the question of whether we can also estimate the average length of stay of ICU patients. Hence, the task is to derive not only the number of incoming and outgoing units from a total net count but also to gain information on the duration time of patients on ICUs. We make use of a stochastic Expectation-Maximisation algorithm and additionally include exogenous information which are assumed to explain the intensity of inflow.</p></details> |  |

However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective for knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low hallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of test-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive benchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not consistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more hallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination behavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model choosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual recall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on previously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case studies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to overconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that compared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial.

However, harsh space environments make satellites vulnerable to failures, leading to node removals that disrupt inter-satellite networking. With the high risk of satellite node failures, understanding their impact on end-to-end services is essential. This study investigates the importance of individual nodes on inter-satellite networking and the resilience of mega satellite constellations against node failures. We represent the mega-satellite constellation as discrete temporal graphs and model node failure events accordingly. To quantify node importance for targeted services over time, we propose a service-aware temporal betweenness metric. Leveraging this metric, we develop an analytical framework to identify critical nodes and assess the impact of node failures. The framework takes node failure events as input and efficiently evaluates their impacts across current and subsequent time windows. Simulations on the Starlink constellation setting reveal that satellite networks inherently exhibit resilience to node failures, as their dynamic topology partially restore connectivity and mitigate the long-term impact. Furthermore, we find that the integration of rerouting mechanisms is crucial for unleashing the full resilience potential to ensure rapid recovery of inter-satellite networking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE</p></details> |

Existing methods typically rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets. Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification, which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and zero-shot approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[A novel time integration scheme for linear parabolic PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06556v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a class of Crank-Nicolson (CN) type schemes enhanced by radial basis function (RBF) interpolation for the time integration of linear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). The resulting RBF-CN schemes preserve the structural simplicity of the classical CN method while enabling higher-order temporal accuracy through the optimization of the shape parameter. Consistency analysis shows that the schemes are always at least second-order accurate and a simple choice of the shape parameter increases the accuracy by two orders over the standard CN scheme. Further optimization can reduce the next leading error term to attain even higher-order accuracy. A von Neumann stability analysis confirms that the stability conditions are essentially the same as those of the standard CN scheme. Several numerical experiments in 1D are carried out to verify the theoretical results under different boundary conditions. Particular focus is given to the startup stage, where several strategies for computing the initial steps are examined, and Gauss-Legendre implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) methods are found to be the most effective. The experiments further demonstrate that, with optimal initialization, the proposed schemes deliver accuracy comparable to implicit Runge-Kutta methods while achieving nearly two orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost.</p></details> | 36 pages, 3 figures |

This critical issue is often overlooked in current research, which predominantly relies on data-intensive and computationally expensive fine-tuning approaches. To tackle this, we introduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based, backpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model generalization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural adapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time device data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data distributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The prototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix, facilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer knowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter changes and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and recommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and generality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on MM'25: Proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia</p></details> |

While spatio-temporal graph (STG) models are a leading paradigm for such data, they often fall short in dynamic, human-centric environments due to two fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on static graph topologies, which fail to capture physical, event-driven dynamics, and (2) their tendency to confuse spurious correlations with true causality, undermining robustness in human-centric environments. To address these gaps, we propose the Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (DyC-STG), a novel framework designed for real-time data credibility analysis in IoT. Our framework features two synergistic contributions: an event-driven dynamic graph module that adapts the graph topology in real-time to reflect physical state changes, and a causal reasoning module to distill causally-aware representations by strictly enforcing temporal precedence. To facilitate the research in this domain we release two new real-world datasets. Comprehensive experiments show that DyC-STG establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving an F1-Score of up to 0.930.</p></details> |  |

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no empirical evaluation of TC in a TSN-5G network. This paper empirically evaluates an 5G end-to-end TC in a TSN-5G network, implemented on commercial TSN switches with a single clock. For TC development, we compute the residence time in 5G and recover the clock domain at the slave node. We deploy a TSN-5G testbed with commercial equipment for synchronization evaluation by modifying the Precision Timing Protocol (PTP) message transmission rates. Experimental results show a peak-to-peak synchronization of 500 ns, meeting the industrial requirement of < 1 us, with minimal synchronization offsets for specific PTP message transmission rates.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients and the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls), employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy. Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner 2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation. ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 7 figures. Preprint.

| **[Trace Repair for Temporal Behavior Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08610v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present methods for repairing traces against specifications given as temporal behavior trees (TBT). TBT are a specification formalism for action sequences in robotics and cyber-physical systems, where specifications of sub-behaviors, given in signal temporal logic, are composed using operators for sequential and parallel composition, fallbacks, and repetition. Trace repairs are useful to explain failures and as training examples that avoid the observed problems. In principle, repairs can be obtained via mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), but this is far too expensive for practical applications. We present two practical repair strategies: (1) incremental repair, which reduces the MILP by splitting the trace into segments, and (2) landmark-based repair, which solves the repair problem iteratively using TBT's robust semantics as a heuristic that approximates MILP with more efficient linear programming. In our experiments, we were able to repair traces with more than 25,000 entries in under ten minutes, while MILP runs out of memory.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAESTRO: Multi-modal Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08578v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public health decision-making. To address this, we present MAESTRO, a Multi-modal Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization. MAESTRO achieves robustness by adaptively fusing multi-modal inputs-including surveillance, web search trends, and meteorological data-and leveraging a comprehensive spectro-temporal architecture. The model first decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components. These are then processed through a hybrid feature enhancement pipeline combining Transformer-based encoders, a Mamba state-space model for long-range dependencies, multi-scale temporal convolutions, and a frequency-domain analysis module. A cross-channel attention mechanism further integrates information across the different data modalities. Finally, a temporal projection head performs sequence-to-sequence forecasting, with an optional estimator to quantify prediction uncertainty. Evaluated on over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period), MAESTRO shows strong competitive performance, demonstrating a superior model fit and relative accuracy, achieving a state-of-the-art R-square of 0.956. Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of both multi-modal fusion and the spectro-temporal components. Our modular and reproducible pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to other regions and pathogens.Our publicly available pipeline presents a powerful, unified framework, demonstrating the critical synergy of advanced spectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal data fusion for robust epidemiological forecasting.</p></details> |  |

This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images. PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth based on multiple past observations. To make use of this PrediTree dataset, we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same experiments but on fewer bands (red, green, blue only), by around $30\%$.

| **[Self-Supervised Temporal Super-Resolution of Energy Data using Generative Adversarial Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10587v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue, this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application scenario is improved by 13%.</p></details> |  |

Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e., in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii) the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments are conducted.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling (PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to +3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22% bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 4th IEEE International Workshop on Sport Technology and Research</p></details> |

Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps. Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low latency (within 5 time-steps).</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

We present \textbf{HybridMamba}, a novel architecture integrating visual transformers with state-space temporal modeling to achieve high-precision crash time localization. Our approach introduces multi-level token compression and hierarchical temporal processing to maintain computational efficiency without sacrificing temporal resolution. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset from the Iowa Department of Transportation, HybridMamba achieves a mean absolute error of \textbf{1.50 seconds} for 2-minute videos ($p<0.01$ compared to baselines), with \textbf{65.2%} of predictions falling within one second of the ground truth. It outperforms recent video-language models (e.g., TimeChat, VideoLLaMA-2) by up to 3.95 seconds while using significantly fewer parameters (3B vs. 13--72B). Our results demonstrate effective temporal localization across various video durations (2--40 minutes) and diverse environmental conditions, highlighting HybridMamba's potential for fine-grained temporal localization in traffic surveillance while identifying challenges that remain for extended deployment.</p></details> |  |

While most existing studies assume static datasets, in real-world scenarios clients may continuously collect data with time-varying and non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. A critical challenge is how to adapt models in a timely yet efficient manner to such evolving data. In this paper, we propose FedTeddi, a temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware scheduling algorithm that facilitates fast convergence of FEEL under dynamic data evolution and communication resource limits. We first quantify the temporal dynamics and non-i.i.d. characteristics of data using temporal drift and collective divergence, respectively, and represent them as the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) of class distributions for classification tasks. We then propose a novel optimization objective and develop a joint scheduling and bandwidth allocation algorithm, enabling the FEEL system to learn from new data quickly without forgetting previous knowledge. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence compared to benchmark methods, improving the rate of convergence by 58.4% on CIFAR-10 and 49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Given a dynamical system and a specification, the objective is to synthesize the controller such that the closed-loop system satisfies this specification while maximizing its resilience. The problem is formulated as a robust optimization program where the objective is to compute the maximum resilience while simultaneously synthesizing the corresponding controller parameters. For linear systems and linear controllers, exact solutions are provided for the class of time-varying polytopic specifications. For the case of nonlinear systems, nonlinear controllers and more general specifications, we leverage tools from the scenario optimization approach, offering a probabilistic guarantee of the solution as well as computational feasibility.

Is it feasible to instead use readily available video captions as weak supervision? To address this question, we propose LASER, a neuro-symbolic framework to enable training STSG generators using only video captions. LASER employs large language models to first extract logical specifications with rich spatio-temporal semantic information from video captions. LASER then trains the underlying STSG generator to align the predicted STSG with the specification. The alignment algorithm overcomes the challenges of weak supervision by leveraging a differentiable symbolic reasoner and using a combination of contrastive, temporal, and semantics losses. The overall approach efficiently trains low-level perception models to extract a fine-grained STSG that conforms to the video caption. In doing so, it enables a novel methodology for learning STSGs without tedious annotations. We evaluate our method on three video datasets: OpenPVSG, 20BN, and MUGEN. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over fully-supervised baselines, achieving a unary predicate prediction accuracy of 27.78% (+12.65%) and a binary recall@5 of 0.42 (+0.22) on OpenPVSG. Additionally, LASER exceeds baselines by 7% on 20BN and 5.2% on MUGEN in terms of overall predicate prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Improved Classification of Nitrogen Stress Severity in Plants Under Combined Stress Conditions Using Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06625v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses, both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment. Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral, and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data, document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low, medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies. We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop management and improved plant health.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 7 Tables</p></details> |

Functional testing detects SDE-related faults but is expensive to simulate. We present a unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) for fast, accurate prediction of long-cycle fault impact probabilities (FIPs) in large sequential circuits, supporting quantitative risk assessment. Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to capture topology and signal timing; dedicated spatial and temporal encoders predict multi-cycle FIPs efficiently. On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). The framework accepts features from testability metrics or fault simulation, allowing efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. A test-point selection study shows that choosing observation points by predicted FIPs improves detection of long-cycle, hard-to-detect faults. The approach scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization and fits downstream electronic design automation flows.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, plan to submit to ACM TODAES</p></details> |

Here we developed a multi-dimensional framework to examine gender differences in scientific knowledge creation through three complementary temporal dimensions: stability (consistency of performance over time), volatility (degree of year-to-year fluctuation), and persistence (ability to maintain high performance for extended periods). Using comprehensive bibliometric data from SciSciNet covering 62.5 million authors whose careers began between 1960-2010, we constructed knowledge creation capability measures that captured how scientists absorb knowledge from diverse sources and contribute to field advancement. We found that female scientists demonstrated significantly higher knowledge production stability (0.170 vs. 0.119 for males) while simultaneously exhibiting greater year-to-year volatility (6.606 vs. 6.228), revealing a striking paradox in career dynamics. Female scientists showed persistence advantages under moderate performance requirements but faced disadvantages under extreme criteria demanding sustained peak performance. However, these patterns varied substantially across disciplines, with female advantages strongest in humanities and social sciences while STEM fields show mixed results.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment, fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and reducing the scale drift over long sequences.

| **[Multi-Strategy Guided Diffusion via Sparse Masking Temporal Reweighting Distribution Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05992v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information. The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of 2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.</p></details> |  |

Traditional input modalities, such as Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements. Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network (MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI, comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures (VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety of applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the precise and efficient decoding of MI remains challenging due to their non-stationary nature and low signal-to-noise ratio. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end deep learning framework of Discriminative Residual Dense Convolutional Autoencoder with Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (DRDCAE-STGNN) to enhance the MI feature learning and classification. Specifically, the DRDCAE module leverages residual-dense connections to learn discriminative latent representations through joint reconstruction and classifica-tion, while the STGNN module captures dynamic spatial dependencies via a learnable graph adjacency matrix and models temporal dynamics using bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM). Extensive evaluations on BCI Competition IV 2a, 2b, and PhysioNet datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 95.42%, 97.51%, and 90.15%, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component, and interpreta-bility analysis reveals neurophysiologically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, despite its complexity, the model maintains a feasible parameter count and an inference time of 0.32 ms per sample. These results indicate that our method offers a robust, accurate, and interpretable solution for MI-EEG decoding, with strong generalizability across subjects and tasks and meeting the requirements for potential real-time BCI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to IEEE Journal</p></details> |

Although powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis, previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on change captioning and visual question answering tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

Deep learning (DL), especially with motion information, has improved segmentation accuracy. However, existing techniques for motion enhancement are not yet optimal, and they have high computational costs due to increased dimensionality or reduced robustness due to suboptimal approaches that use non-DL motion registration, non-attention models, or single-headed attention. They further have limited adaptability and are inconvenient for incorporation into existing networks where motion awareness is desired. Here, we propose a novel, computationally efficient Temporal Attention Module (TAM) that offers robust motion enhancement, modeled as a small, multi-headed, cross-temporal attention module. TAM's uniqueness is that it is a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be inserted into a broad range of segmentation networks (CNN-based, Transformer-based, or hybrid) for motion enhancement without requiring substantial changes in the network's backbone. This feature enables high adaptability and ease of integration for enhancing both existing and future networks. Extensive experiments on multiple 2D and 3D cardiac ultrasound and MRI datasets confirm that TAM consistently improves segmentation across a range of networks while maintaining computational efficiency and improving on currently reported performance. The evidence demonstrates that it is a robust, generalizable solution for motion-awareness enhancement that is scalable (such as from 2D to 3D).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation in the 6th International Workshop of Advances in Simplifying Medical Ultrasound (ASMUS).

| **[Select, then Balance: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Exogenous-Aware Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05779v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting aims to predict the future state of dynamic systems and plays an important role in multiple fields. However, existing solutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target variables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into the model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to promote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two challenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the target system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and future variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \model, a novel framework for modeling \underline{exo}genous variables in \underline{s}patio-\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select, then balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated expert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent space to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized sub-experts. Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which recomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs are integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic balance during the modeling process. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency of our proposed framework.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

We introduce three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance for downstream SLAM.</p></details> |  |

We apply these results to analyze the performance of the Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithm with linear function approximations, a widely used method for policy evaluation in Reinforcement Learning (RL), obtaining a sharp high-probability consistency guarantee that matches the asymptotic variance up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, we establish an $O(T^{-\frac{1}{4}}\log T)$ distributional convergence rate for the Gaussian approximation of the TD estimator, measured in convex distance. Our martingale bounds are of broad applicability, and our analysis of TD learning provides new insights into statistical inference for RL algorithms, bridging gaps between classical stochastic approximation theory and modern RL applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaSTH-Sleep: Towards Effective Few-Shot Sleep Stage Classification for Health Management with Spatial-Temporal Hypergraph Enhanced Meta-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17142v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of sleep stages based on bio-signals is fundamental not only for automatic sleep stage annotation, but also for clinical health management and continuous sleep monitoring. Traditionally, this task relies on experienced clinicians to manually annotate data, a process that is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, deep learning methods have shown promise in automating this task. However, three major challenges remain: (1) deep learning models typically require large-scale labeled datasets, making them less effective in real-world settings where annotated data is limited; (2) significant inter-individual variability in bio-signals often results in inconsistent model performance when applied to new subjects, limiting generalization; and (3) existing approaches often overlook the high-order relationships among bio-signals, failing to simultaneously capture signal heterogeneity and spatial-temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose MetaSTH-Sleep, a few-shot sleep stage classification framework based on spatial-temporal hypergraph enhanced meta-learning. Our approach enables rapid adaptation to new subjects using only a few labeled samples, while the hypergraph structure effectively models complex spatial interconnections and temporal dynamics simultaneously in EEG signals. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaSTH-Sleep achieves substantial performance improvements across diverse subjects, offering valuable insights to support clinicians in sleep stage annotation.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPA: Temporal Prompt Alignment for Fetal Congenital Heart Defect Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15298v5)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA), a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to 58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Connectionist Temporal Classification for Phoneme Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05399v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Phoneme Recognition (APR) systems are often trained using pseudo phoneme-level annotations generated from text through Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) systems. These G2P systems frequently output multiple possible pronunciations per word, but the standard Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss cannot account for such ambiguity during training. In this work, we adapt Graph Temporal Classification (GTC) to the APR setting. GTC enables training from a graph of alternative phoneme sequences, allowing the model to consider multiple pronunciations per word as valid supervision. Our experiments on English and Dutch data sets show that incorporating multiple pronunciations per word into the training loss consistently improves phoneme error rates compared to a baseline trained with CTC. These results suggest that integrating pronunciation variation into the loss function is a promising strategy for training APR systems from noisy G2P-based supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Workshop (ASRU 2025)</p></details> |

While there are many published and powerful deep neural network (DNN)-based methods for SD, few are optimized for resource-constrained platforms such as mobile devices. Additionally, most DNN-based methods for SD are not focusing on full-band (FB) signals, i.e. having 48 kHz sampling rate, and/or low latency cases. In this paper we present a causal, low latency, and lightweight DNN-based method for full-band SD, leveraging both short and long temporal patterns. The method is based on a modified UNet architecture employing look-back frames, temporal spanning of convolutional kernels, and recurrent neural networks for exploiting short and long temporal patterns in the signal and estimated denoising mask. The DNN operates on a causal frame-by-frame basis taking as an input the STFT magnitude, utilizes inverted bottlenecks inspired by MobileNet, employs causal instance normalization for channel-wise normalization, and achieves a real-time factor below 0.02 when deployed on a modern mobile phone. The proposed method is evaluated using established speech denoising metrics and publicly available datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving an (SI-)SDR value that outperforms existing FB and low latency SD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Proceedings of the 2025 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP)</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Spectrum Analysis for Multi-Constellation Space Domain Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05149v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Space Domain Awareness (SDA) system has different major aspects including continues and robust awareness from the network that is crucial for an efficient control over all actors in space. The observability of the space assets on the other hand requires efficient analysis on when and how observed space objects can be controlled. This becomes crucial when real-world spatial dynamics are taken into account as it introduces complexities into the system. The real-world dynamics can reveal the structure of the network including isolated and dominant stations. We propose a Temporal Spectrum Analysis (TSA) scheme that takes into account a set of real-world parameters including actual dynamics of the objects in space to analyze the structure of a ground-space network that inherits temporal spectrum as the key element of design. We study the potential interactions between multiple constellations using TSA and conduct a comprehensive real-world simulations to quantify the structure of the network. Numerical results show how the temporal spectrum of each satellite affects the intra- and inter-constellation network structure including interactions between ground stations and constellations.</p></details> |  |

This study systematically evaluates several state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, their Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) variants and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on long-context clinical summarization and prediction. We examine their ability to synthesize structured and unstructured Electronic Health Records (EHR) data while reasoning over temporal coherence, by re-engineering existing tasks, including discharge summarization and diagnosis prediction from two publicly available EHR datasets. Our results indicate that long context windows improve input integration but do not consistently enhance clinical reasoning, and LLMs are still struggling with temporal progression and rare disease prediction. While RAG shows improvements in hallucination in some cases, it does not fully address these limitations. Our work fills the gap in long clinical text summarization, establishing a foundation for evaluating LLMs with multi-modal data and temporal reasoning.</p></details> |  |

To address key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro) contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling spatial dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures, under review for journal publication</p></details> |

We show that those temporal languages which do not pp-construct EVERYTHING (and thus by the classification are solvable in polynomial time) have, in fact, very limited expressive power as measured by the graphs and hypergraphs they can pp-interpret. This limitation yields many previously unknown algebraic consequences, while also providing new, uniform proofs for known invariance properties. In particular, we show that such temporal constraint languages admit $4$-ary pseudo-Siggers polymorphisms -- a result that sustains the possibility that the existence of such polymorphisms extends to the much broader context of the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture.</p></details> | 21 pages |

The proposed TIMGen (Temporal Interest-driven Multimodal Generation) model addresses this challenge by modeling the long-term temporal evolution of users' interests and capturing dynamic interest representations with strong temporal dependencies. This model also supports the fusion of multimodal features, such as text, images, video, and audio, and delivers customized content based on multimodal preferences. TIMGen jointly learns temporal dependencies and modal preferences to obtain a unified interest representation, which it then generates to meet users' personalized content needs. TIMGen overcomes the shortcomings of personalized content recommendation methods based on static preferences, enabling flexible and dynamic modeling of users' multimodal interests, better understanding and capturing their interests and preferences. It can be extended to a variety of practical application scenarios, including e-commerce, advertising, online education, and precision medicine, providing insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we model the observations by two weakly time-stationary point processes with spatial intensity measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ over the expanding window $(0,t]$ as $t$ increases to infinity, and establish sharp convergence rates of the empirical UOT in terms of the intrinsic dimensions of the measures. We assume a sub-quadratic temporal growth condition of the variance of the process, which allows for a wide range of temporal dependencies. As the growth approaches quadratic, the convergence rate becomes slower. This variance assumption is related to the time-reduced factorial covariance measure, and we exemplify its validity for various point processes, including the Poisson cluster, Hawkes, Neyman-Scott, and log-Gaussian Cox processes. Complementary to our upper bounds, we also derive matching lower bounds for various spatio-temporal point processes of interest and establish near minimax rate optimality of the empirical Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally, 76 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

Existing methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and (ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.</p></details> |  |

Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator.

We propose a human-preference-aligned diffusion framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce direct preference optimization tailored for human-centric animation, leveraging a curated dataset of human preferences to align generated outputs with perceptual metrics for portrait motion-video alignment and naturalness of expression. Second, the proposed temporal motion modulation resolves spatiotemporal resolution mismatches by reshaping motion conditions into dimensionally aligned latent features through temporal channel redistribution and proportional feature expansion, preserving the fidelity of high-frequency motion details in diffusion-based synthesis. The proposed mechanism is complementary to existing UNet and DiT-based portrait diffusion approaches, and experiments demonstrate obvious improvements in lip-audio synchronization, expression vividness, body motion coherence over baseline methods, alongside notable gains in human preference metrics.

The vast majority of TD methods for control learn a policy by bootstrapping from a single action-value function (e.g., Q-learning and Sarsa). Significantly less attention has been given to methods that bootstrap from two asymmetric value functions: i.e., methods that learn state values as an intermediate step in learning action values. Existing algorithms in this vein can be categorized as either QV-learning or AV-learning. Though these algorithms have been investigated to some degree in prior work, it remains unclear if and when it is advantageous to learn two value functions instead of just one -- and whether such approaches are theoretically sound in general. In this paper, we analyze these algorithmic families in terms of convergence and sample efficiency. We find that while both families are more efficient than Expected Sarsa in the prediction setting, only AV-learning methods offer any major benefit over Q-learning in the control setting. Finally, we introduce a new AV-learning algorithm called Regularized Dueling Q-learning (RDQ), which significantly outperforms Dueling DQN in the MinAtar benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in RLC/RLJ 2025.

Different from visual generation, the occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models. Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency}, \textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a \textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Per-Garment Virtual Try-On with Temporal Consistency for Loose-Fitting Garments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12348v3)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Per-garment virtual try-on methods collect garment-specific datasets and train networks tailored to each garment to achieve superior results. However, these approaches often struggle with loose-fitting garments due to two key limitations: (1) They rely on human body semantic maps to align garments with the body, but these maps become unreliable when body contours are obscured by loose-fitting garments, resulting in degraded outcomes; (2) They train garment synthesis networks on a per-frame basis without utilizing temporal information, leading to noticeable jittering artifacts. To address the first limitation, we propose a two-stage approach for robust semantic map estimation. First, we extract a garment-invariant representation from the raw input image. This representation is then passed through an auxiliary network to estimate the semantic map. This enhances the robustness of semantic map estimation under loose-fitting garments during garment-specific dataset generation. To address the second limitation, we introduce a recurrent garment synthesis framework that incorporates temporal dependencies to improve frame-to-frame coherence while maintaining real-time performance. We conducted qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both image quality and temporal coherence. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the garment-invariant representation and the recurrent synthesis framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Exposure Dependence Bias in Vaccine Efficacy Trials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03476v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using time-to-event methods such as Cox proportional hazards models, it is well established that unmeasured heterogeneity in exposure or infection risk can lead to downward bias in point estimates of the per-contact vaccine efficacy (VE) in infectious disease trials. In this study, we explore an unreported source of bias-arising from temporally correlated exposure status-that is typically unmeasured and overlooked in standard analyses. Although this form of bias can plausibly affect a wide range of VE trials, it has received limited empirical attention. We develop a mathematical framework to characterize the mechanism of this bias and derive a closed-form approximation to quantify its magnitude without requiring direct measurement of exposure. Our findings show that, under realistic parameter settings, the resulting bias can be substantial. These results suggest that temporally correlated exposure should be recognized as a potentially important factor in the design and analysis of infectious disease vaccine trials.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

However, as of yet, the analysis of social networks using the time series of people's mobile connectivity data has not been extensively investigated. In the present study, we investigate four snapshot - based temporal GNNs in predicting the phone call and SMS activity between users of a mobile communication network. In addition, we develop a simple non - GNN baseline model using recently proposed EdgeBank method. Our analysis shows that the ROLAND temporal GNN outperforms the baseline model in most cases, whereas the other three GNNs perform on average worse than the baseline. The results show that GNN based approaches hold promise in the analysis of temporal social networks through mobile connectivity data. However, due to the relatively small performance margin between ROLAND and the baseline model, further research is required on specialized GNN architectures for temporal social network analysis.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |
| **[HyPV-LEAD: Proactive Early-Warning of Cryptocurrency Anomalies through Data-Driven Structural-Temporal Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03260v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abnormal cryptocurrency transactions - such as mixing services, fraudulent transfers, and pump-and-dump operations -- pose escalating risks to financial integrity but remain notoriously difficult to detect due to class imbalance, temporal volatility, and complex network dependencies. Existing approaches are predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks. Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits, with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally-Aware Diffusion Model for Brain Progression Modelling with Bidirectional Temporal Regularisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03141v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However, current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures, thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline (backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications, this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The code will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Despite the numerous algorithms proposed with different DL architectures, maintaining a balance among performance, computational complexity, and multi-source ECG feature fusion remains challenging. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across various fields. Their inherent design for high-efficiency computation and linear complexity makes them particularly suitable for low-dimensional data like ECGs. This work proposes S2M2ECG, an SSM architecture featuring three-level fusion mechanisms: (1) Spatio-temporal bi-directional SSMs with segment tokenization for low-level signal fusion, (2) Intra-lead temporal information fusion with bi-directional scanning to enhance recognition accuracy in both forward and backward directions, (3) Cross-lead feature interaction modules for spatial information fusion. To fully leverage the ECG-specific multi-lead mechanisms inherent in ECG signals, a multi-branch design and lead fusion modules are incorporated, enabling individual analysis of each lead while ensuring seamless integration with others. Experimental results reveal that S2M2ECG achieves superior performance in the rhythmic, morphological, and clinical scenarios. Moreover, its lightweight architecture ensures it has nearly the fewest parameters among existing models, making it highly suitable for efficient inference and convenient deployment. Collectively, S2M2ECG offers a promising alternative that strikes an excellent balance among performance, computational complexity, and ECG-specific characteristics, paving the way for high-performance, lightweight computations in CVD diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

Existing works on STL control synthesis mainly focus on generating plans that satisfy properties over a single executed trajectory. In this work, we consider the planning problem for hyperproperties evaluated over a set of possible trajectories, which naturally arise in information-flow control problems. Specifically, we study discrete-time dynamical systems and employ the recently developed temporal logic HyperSTL as the new objective for planning. To solve this problem, we propose a novel recursive counterexample-guided synthesis approach capable of effectively handling HyperSTL specifications with multiple alternating quantifiers. The proposed method is not only applicable to planning but also extends to HyperSTL model checking for discrete-time dynamical systems. Finally, we present case studies on security-preserving planning and ambiguity-free planning to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HyperSTL planning framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lattice Annotated Temporal (LAT) Logic for Non-Markovian Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02958v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Lattice Annotated Temporal (LAT) Logic, an extension of Generalized Annotated Logic Programs (GAPs) that incorporates temporal reasoning and supports open-world semantics through the use of a lower lattice structure. This logic combines an efficient deduction process with temporal logic programming to support non-Markovian relationships and open-world reasoning capabilities. The open-world aspect, a by-product of the use of the lower-lattice annotation structure, allows for efficient grounding through a Skolemization process, even in domains with infinite or highly diverse constants. We provide a suite of theoretical results that bound the computational complexity of the grounding process, in addition to showing that many of the results on GAPs (using an upper lattice) still hold with the lower lattice and temporal extensions (though different proof techniques are required). Our open-source implementation, PyReason, features modular design, machine-level optimizations, and direct integration with reinforcement learning environments. Empirical evaluations across multi-agent simulations and knowledge graph tasks demonstrate up to three orders of magnitude speedup and up to five orders of magnitude memory reduction while maintaining or improving task performance. Additionally, we evaluate LAT Logic's value in reinforcement learning environments as a non-Markovian simulator, achieving up to three orders of magnitude faster simulation with improved agent performance, including a 26% increase in win rate due to capturing richer temporal dependencies. These results highlight LAT Logic's potential as a unified, extensible framework for open-world temporal reasoning in dynamic and uncertain environments. Our implementation is available at: pyreason.syracuse.edu.</p></details> |  |

Existing modeling methods are limited by local receptive fields, making it difficult to capture long-range temporal patterns and cross-band dynamic coupling effects in machine acoustic features. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, ESTM, which is based on a dual-path Mamba architecture with time-frequency decoupled modeling and utilizes Selective State-Space Models (SSM) for long-range sequence modeling. ESTM extracts rich feature representations from different time segments and frequency bands by fusing enhanced Mel spectrograms and raw audio features, while further improving sensitivity to anomalous patterns through the TriStat-Gating (TSG) module. Our experiments demonstrate that ESTM improves anomalous detection performance on the DCASE 2020 Task 2 dataset, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Signal Processing Letters 2025</p></details> |

However, space applications require reliable and precise computations, while memristive devices suffer from non-idealities, such as device variability, conductance drifts, and device faults. Thus, porting neural networks (NNs) to memristive devices often faces the challenge of severe performance degradation. In this work, we show in simulations that memristor-based NNs achieve competitive performance levels on on-board tasks, such as navigation \& control and geodesy of asteroids. Through bit-slicing, temporal averaging of NN layers, and periodic activation functions, we improve initial results from around $0.07$ to $0.01$ and $0.3$ to $0.007$ for both tasks using RRAM devices, coming close to state-of-the-art levels ($0.003-0.005$ and $0.003$, respectively). Our results demonstrate the potential of memristors for on-board space applications, and we are convinced that future technology and NN improvements will further close the performance gap to fully unlock the benefits of memristors.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, IAA acta astronautica. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2509.02369</p></details> |
| **[Bullet: Boosting GPU Utilization for LLM Serving via Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Orchestration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19516v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern LLM serving systems confront inefficient GPU utilization due to the fundamental mismatch between compute-intensive prefill and memory-bound decode phases. While current practices attempt to address this by organizing these phases into hybrid batches, such solutions create an inefficient tradeoff that sacrifices either throughput or latency, leaving substantial GPU resources underutilized. We identify two key root causes: 1) the prefill phase suffers from suboptimal compute utilization due to wave quantization and attention bottlenecks. 2) hybrid batches disproportionately prioritize latency over throughput, resulting in wasted compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate the issues, we present Bullet, a novel spatial-temporal orchestration system that eliminates these inefficiencies through precise phase coordination. Bullet enables concurrent execution of prefill and decode phases, while dynamically provisioning GPU resources using real-time performance modeling. By integrating SLO-aware scheduling and adaptive resource allocation, Bullet maximizes utilization without compromising latency targets. Experimental evaluations on real-world workloads demonstrate that Bullet delivers 1.26x average throughput gains (up to 1.55x) over state-of-the-arts, while consistently meeting latency constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Temporal Knowledge-Base Creation for Fine-Grained Opinion Analysis with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02363v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a scalable method for constructing a temporal opinion knowledge base with large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators. Despite the demonstrated utility of time-series opinion analysis of text for downstream applications such as forecasting and trend analysis, existing methodologies underexploit this potential due to the absence of temporally grounded fine-grained annotations. Our approach addresses this gap by integrating well-established opinion mining formulations into a declarative LLM annotation pipeline, enabling structured opinion extraction without manual prompt engineering. We define three data models grounded in sentiment and opinion mining literature, serving as schemas for structured representation. We perform rigorous quantitative evaluation of our pipeline using human-annotated test samples. We carry out the final annotations using two separate LLMs, and inter-annotator agreement is computed label-wise across the fine-grained opinion dimensions, analogous to human annotation protocols. The resulting knowledge base encapsulates time-aligned, structured opinions and is compatible with applications in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), temporal question answering, and timeline summarisation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ST-Hyper: Learning High-Order Dependencies Across Multiple Spatial-Temporal Scales for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02217v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, many deep learning based methods have been proposed for modeling dependencies at multiple spatial (inter-variate) or temporal (intra-variate) scales. However, existing methods may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales (ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of 3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Maximum entropy temporal networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02098v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal networks consist of timestamped directed interactions rather than static links. These links may appear continuously in time, yet few studies have directly tackled the continuous-time modeling of networks. Here, we introduce a maximum entropy approach to temporal networks and with basic assumptions on constraints, the corresponding network ensembles admit a modular and interpretable representation: a set of global time processes -- an inhomogeneous Poisson or a Hawkes process -- and a static maximum-entropy (MaxEnt) edge, e.g. node pair, probability. This time-edge labels factorization yields closed-form log-likelihoods, degree/unique-edge expectations, and yields a whole class of effective generative models. We provide maximum-entropy derivation of a log-linear Hawkes/NHPP intensity for temporal networks via functional optimization over path entropy, connecting inhomogeneous Poisson modeling -- e.g., Hawkes models -- to MaxEnt network ensembles. Global Hawkes time layers consistently improve log-likelihood over generic NHPP, while the MaxEnt edge labels recover strength constraints and reproduce expected unique-degree curves. We discuss the limitations of this unified framework and how it could be integrated with calibrated community/motif tools, Hawkes calibration procedures, and (neural) kernel estimation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Sequential Ordinal Models: Application to Invasive Weeds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01976v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multivariate sequential ordinal model is investigated for use in the Bayesian analysis of spatio-temporal ordinal data. The sequential ordinal model likelihood is equivalent to a binary model conditional on unknown regression coefficients and spatio-temporal random effects. Therefore, estimation and prediction in the space-time context can proceed using the well-established dynamic generalised linear model framework. Moreover, the sequential ordinal model avoids the ordering constraints on the threshold parameters that determine the category break points required by cumulative ordinal models, and so simplifies the estimation procedure for high-dimensional space-time applications using Bayesian inference. The dynamic spatio-temporal sequential ordinal model is applied to estimate foliage cover abundance of four actively managed invasive alien species. These invasive weed species are observed by means of a modified Braun-Blanquet score that is commonly used in vegetation studies and constitutes ordinal data. The multivariate ordinal data for the managed weeds species are sparsely distributed in space and time with few observations recorded in high foliage cover categories. A separable model for space-time dependence that maintains parameter interpretability in the presence of aggregated ordinal categories is therefore developed. Estimation and prediction is demonstrated using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) methods developed for univariate spatio-temporal models. Bayesian estimation and prediction shows that the four invasive weed species differentially respond to habitat type, control effort and accessibility, and share similar magnitudes of dependence with short effective spatial ranges and strong temporal autocorrelations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Representation Learning for Real-Time Ultrasound Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01433v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultrasound (US) imaging is a critical tool in medical diagnostics, offering real-time visualization of physiological processes. One of its major advantages is its ability to capture temporal dynamics, which is essential for assessing motion patterns in applications such as cardiac monitoring, fetal development, and vascular imaging. Despite its importance, current deep learning models often overlook the temporal continuity of ultrasound sequences, analyzing frames independently and missing key temporal dependencies. To address this gap, we propose a method for learning effective temporal representations from ultrasound videos, with a focus on echocardiography-based ejection fraction (EF) estimation. EF prediction serves as an ideal case study to demonstrate the necessity of temporal learning, as it requires capturing the rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the heart. Our approach leverages temporally consistent masking and contrastive learning to enforce temporal coherence across video frames, enhancing the model's ability to represent motion patterns. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, our method achieves a substantial improvement in EF prediction accuracy, highlighting the importance of temporally-aware representation learning for real-time ultrasound analysis.</p></details> | ICMl 2025 Workshop |

We use mixed Poisson models to analyze these patterns and to determine the association between mortality rates and various socioeconomic and contextual factors, while controlling for spatial and temporal confounding effects. Our results indicate that a 10% increase in the proportion of people residing in rural areas is associated with an increase of over 5% in male suicide mortality. In addition, a 1% increase in the annual unemployment rate is linked to a 2.4% increase in female suicide mortality. An important finding is that despite male suicide rates consistently being higher than female rates, we observe a notable and steady upward trend in female suicide mortality over the study period.</p></details> |  |
| **[Re3: Learning to Balance Relevance & Recency for Temporal Information Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01306v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Information Retrieval (TIR) is a critical yet unresolved task for modern search systems, retrieving documents that not only satisfy a query's information need but also adhere to its temporal constraints. This task is shaped by two challenges: Relevance, ensuring alignment with the query's explicit temporal requirements, and Recency, selecting the freshest document among multiple versions. Existing methods often address the two challenges in isolation, relying on brittle heuristics that fail in scenarios where temporal requirements and staleness resistance are intertwined. To address this gap, we introduce Re2Bench, a benchmark specifically designed to disentangle and evaluate Relevance, Recency, and their hybrid combination. Building on this foundation, we propose Re3, a unified and lightweight framework that dynamically balances semantic and temporal information through a query-aware gating mechanism. On Re2Bench, Re3 achieves state-of-the-art results, leading in R@1 across all three subsets. Ablation studies with backbone sensitivity tests confirm robustness, showing strong generalization across diverse encoders and real-world settings. This work provides both a generalizable solution and a principled evaluation suite, advancing the development of temporally aware retrieval systems.

| **[Temporal Preference Optimization for Long-Form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13919v3)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in video large multimodal models (video-LMMs), achieving effective temporal grounding in long-form videos remains a challenge for existing models. To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework designed to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through preference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to differentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by leveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal grounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal grounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video sequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly enhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated data. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness of TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO establishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark, underscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for advancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

| **[DynaMind: Reconstructing Dynamic Visual Scenes from EEG by Aligning Temporal Dynamics and Multimodal Semantics to Guided Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01177v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper (RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal consistency between the feature representations and the original neural recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by 12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual semantics.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Maximum a Posteriori Probability (MAP) Joint Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) and Channel Estimation for MIMO Channels with Spatial and Temporal Correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01032v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider time varying MIMO fading channels with known spatial and temporal correlation and solve the problem of joint carrier frequency offset (CFO) and channel estimation with prior distributions. The maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) joint estimation is proved to be equivalent to a separate MAP estimation of the CFO followed by minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation of the channel while treating the estimated CFO as true. The MAP solution is useful to take advantage of the estimates from the previous data packet. A low complexity universal CFO estimation algorithm is extended from the time invariant case to the time varying case. Unlike past algorithms, the universal algorithm does not need phase unwrapping to take advantage of the full range of symbol correlation and achieves the derived Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (BCRLB) in almost all SNR range. We provide insight on the the relation among the temporal correlation coefficient of the fading, the CFO estimation performance, and the pilot signal structure. An unexpected observation is that the BCRLB is not a monotone function of the temporal correlation and is strongly influenced by the pilot signal structures. A simple rearrangement of the 0's and 1's in the pilot signal matrix will render the BCRLB from being non-monotone to being monotone in certain temporal correlation ranges. Since the BCRLB is shown to be achieved by the proposed algorithm, it provides a guideline for pilot signal design.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages.

Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs. ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controller synthesis method for multi-agent system based on temporal logic specification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00870v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controller synthesis is a theoretical approach to the systematic design of discrete event systems. It constructs a controller to provide feedback and control to the system, ensuring it meets specified control specifications. Traditional controller synthesis methods often use formal languages to describe control specifications and are mainly oriented towards single-agent and non-probabilistic systems. With the increasing complexity of systems, the control requirements that need to be satisfied also become more complex. Based on this, this paper proposes a controller synthesis method for semi-cooperative semi-competitive multi-agent probabilistic discrete event systems to solve the controller synthesis problem based on temporal logic specifications. The controller can ensure the satisfaction of specifications to a certain extent. The specification is given in the form of a linear temporal logic formula.

To address this critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and natural language explanations, generated through a novel hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

Although existing works can achieve fine-grained controllability based on timestamp information, sound event categories are limited to a fixed set. Moreover, since only simulated data is used for training, the generated audio quality and generalization performance on real data are limited. To tackle this issue, we propose PicoAudio2, improving temporal-controllable TTA via a new data processing pipeline and model architecture. Specifically, we use a grounding model to annotate event timestamps of real audio-text datasets to curate temporally-strong real data, in addition to simulation data from existing works. The model is trained on the combination of real and simulation data. Moreover, following PicoAudio, we encode timestamp information into a timestamp matrix to provide extra fine-grained time-aligned information to the model, on top of the coarse-grained textual description. Experiments show that PicoAudio2 exhibits superior performance in terms of temporal controllability and audio quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Demo ...</summary><p>Demo page: https://HiRookie9.github.io/PicoAudio2-Page</p></details> |
| **[A Risk-aware Spatial-temporal Trajectory Planning Framework for Autonomous Vehicles Using QP-MPC and Dynamic Hazard Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00643v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning is a critical component in ensuring the safety, stability, and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. While existing trajectory planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i) a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives, providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting the Ionosphere from Sparse GNSS Data with Temporal-Fusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00631v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ionosphere critically influences Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations, but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices, and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as 3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abstract Interpretation of Temporal Safety Effects of Higher Order Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02791v3)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes a new abstract interpretation-based approach to verify temporal safety properties of recursive, higher-order programs. While prior works have provided theoretical impact and some automation, they have had limited scalability. We begin with a new automata-based "abstract effect domain" for summarizing context-sensitive dependent effects, capable of abstracting relations between the program environment and the automaton control state. Our analysis includes a new transformer for abstracting event prefixes to automatically computed context-sensitive effect summaries, and is instantiated in a type-and-effect system grounded in abstract interpretation. Since the analysis is parametric on the automaton, we next instantiate it to a broader class of history/register (or "accumulator") automata, beyond finite state automata to express some context-free properties, input-dependency, event summation, resource usage, cost, equal event magnitude, etc. We implemented a prototype evDrift that computes dependent effect summaries (and validates assertions) for OCaml-like recursive higher-order programs. As a basis of comparison, we describe reductions to assertion checking for higher-order but effect-free programs, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior tools Drift, RCaml/Spacer, MoCHi, and ReTHFL. Overall, across a set of 23 benchmarks, Drift verified 12 benchmarks, RCaml/Spacer verified 6, MoCHi verified 11, ReTHFL verified 18, and evDrift verified 21; evDrift also achieved a 6.3x, 5.3x, 16.8x, and 6.4x speedup over Drift, RCaml/Spacer, MoCHi, and ReTHFL, respectively, on those benchmarks that both tools could solve.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transforming Norm-based To Graph-based Spatial Representation for Spatio-Temporal Epidemiological Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14539v3)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pandemics, with their profound societal and economic impacts, pose significant threats to global health, mortality rates, economic stability, and political landscapes. In response to these challenges, numerous studies have employed spatio-temporal models to enhance our understanding and management of these complex phenomena. These spatio-temporal models can be roughly divided into two main spatial categories: norm-based and graph-based. Norm-based models are usually more accurate and easier to model but are more computationally intensive and require more data to fit. On the other hand, graph-based models are less accurate and harder to model but are less computationally intensive and require fewer data to fit. As such, ideally, one would like to use a graph-based model while preserving the representation accuracy obtained by the norm-based model. In this study, we explore the ability to transform from norm-based to graph-based spatial representation for these models. We first show no analytical mapping between the two exists, requiring one to use approximation numerical methods instead. We introduce a novel framework for this task together with twelve possible implementations using a wide range of heuristic optimization approaches. Our findings show that by leveraging agent-based simulations and heuristic algorithms for the graph node's location and population's spatial walk dynamics approximation one can use graph-based spatial representation without losing much of the model's accuracy and expressiveness. We investigate our framework for three real-world cases, achieving 94\% accuracy preservation, on average. Moreover, an analysis of synthetic cases shows the proposed framework is relatively robust for changes in both spatial and temporal properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[SurgLLM: A Versatile Large Multimodal Model with Spatial Focus and Temporal Awareness for Surgical Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00357v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness. Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM. Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks, including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding.

| **[The Temporal Game: A New Perspective on Temporal Relation Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00250v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we demo the Temporal Game, a novel approach to temporal relation extraction that casts the task as an interactive game. Instead of directly annotating interval-level relations, our approach decomposes them into point-wise comparisons between the start and end points of temporal entities. At each step, players classify a single point relation, and the system applies temporal closure to infer additional relations and enforce consistency. This point-based strategy naturally supports both interval and instant entities, enabling more fine-grained and flexible annotation than any previous approach. The Temporal Game also lays the groundwork for training reinforcement learning agents, by treating temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making task. To showcase this potential, the demo presented in this paper includes a Game mode, in which users annotate texts from the TempEval-3 dataset and receive feedback based on a scoring system, and an Annotation mode, that allows custom documents to be annotated and resulting timeline to be exported. Therefore, this demo serves both as a research tool and an annotation interface. The demo is publicly available at https://temporal-game.inesctec.pt, and the source code is open-sourced to foster further research and community-driven development in temporal reasoning and annotation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Pixels: Introducing Geometric-Semantic World Priors for Video-based Embodied Models via Spatio-temporal Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00210v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence. While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model. Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic, implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate 1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Social Media Engagement from Emotional and Temporal Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21650v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement (comments and likes) from emotional and temporal features. The dataset contains 600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics. A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets. Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2). Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature set.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Temporal Flow Matching for Learning Spatio-Temporal Trajectories in 4D Longitudinal Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21580v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions. While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e. predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports $3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geospatial Question Answering on Historical Maps Using Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21491v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances have enabled the extraction of vectorized features from digital historical maps. To fully leverage this information, however, the extracted features must be organized in a structured and meaningful way that supports efficient access and use. One promising approach is question answering (QA), which allows users -- especially those unfamiliar with database query languages -- to retrieve knowledge in a natural and intuitive manner. In this project, we developed a GeoQA system by integrating a spatio-temporal knowledge graph (KG) constructed from historical map data with large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we have defined the ontology to guide the construction of the spatio-temporal KG and investigated workflows of two different types of GeoQA: factual and descriptive. Additional data sources, such as historical map images and internet search results, are incorporated into our framework to provide extra context for descriptive GeoQA. Evaluation results demonstrate that the system can generate answers with a high delivery rate and a high semantic accuracy. To make the framework accessible, we further developed a web application that supports interactive querying and visualization.</p></details> |  |
| **[The impact of heatwave-driven air conditioning adoption on electricity demand: A spatio-temporal case study for Germany](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13534v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intensifying heatwaves driven by climate change are accelerating the adoption of mobile air conditioning (AC) systems. A rapid mass adoption of such AC systems could create additional stress on electricity grids and the power system. This study presents a novel method to estimate the electricity demand from AC systems both at the system level and at high temporal and spatial granularity. We apply the method to a near-future heatwave scenario in Germany in which household AC adoption increases from the current 19% to 35% during a heatwave similar to the one of July 2025. We analyze the effects for 196,428 grid cells of one square kilometer across Germany, by combining weather data, census data, socio-demographic assumptions, mobility patterns, and temperature-dependent AC activation functions. We find that electricity demand of newly purchased mobile AC systems could increase the peak load by over 12.9 GW, with urban hot-spots reaching 5.2 MW per square kilometer. The temporal pattern creates a pronounced afternoon peak that coincides with lower photovoltaic generation, potentially exacerbating power system stability challenges. Our findings underscore the urgency for proactive energy system planning to manage emerging demand peaks.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures |

Longitudinal Radiology Report Generation (LRRG) extends RRG by incorporating the ability to compare current and prior exams, facilitating the tracking of temporal changes in clinical findings. Existing LRRG approaches only extract features from prior and current images using a visual pre-trained encoder, which are then concatenated to generate the final report. However, these methods struggle to effectively capture both spatial and temporal correlations during the feature extraction process. Consequently, the extracted features inadequately capture the information of difference across exams and thus underrepresent the expected progressions, leading to sub-optimal performance in LRRG. To address this, we develop a novel dynamic difference-aware temporal residual network (DDaTR). In DDaTR, we introduce two modules at each stage of the visual encoder to capture multi-level spatial correlations. The Dynamic Feature Alignment Module (DFAM) is designed to align prior features across modalities for the integrity of prior clinical information. Prompted by the enriched prior features, the dynamic difference-aware module (DDAM) captures favorable difference information by identifying relationships across exams. Furthermore, our DDaTR employs the dynamic residual network to unidirectionally transmit longitudinal information, effectively modelling temporal correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrated superior performance over existing methods on three benchmarks, proving its efficacy in both RRG and LRRG tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (TMI).

In this paper, we propose an Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1) Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

TNNs are composed of columns, which in turn employ neurons as their building blocks. Each neuron processes volleys of input spikes, modulated by associated synaptic weights, on its dendritic inputs. Recently proposed neuron implementation in CMOS employs a Spike Response Model (SRM) with a ramp-no-leak (RNL) response function and assumes all the inputs can carry spikes. However, in actual spike volleys, only a small subset of the dendritic inputs actually carry spikes in each compute cycle. This form of sparsity can be exploited to achieve better hardware efficiency. In this paper, we propose a Catwalk neuron implementation by relocating spikes in a spike volley as a sorted subset cluster via unary top-k. Such relocation can significantly reduce the cost of the subsequent parallel counter (PC) for accumulating the response functions from the spiking inputs. This can lead to improvements on area and power efficiency in RNL neuron implementation. Place-and-route results show Catwalk is 1.39x and 1.86x better in area and power, respectively, as compared to existing SRM0-RNL neurons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Amar ...</summary><p>Amar Mukherjee Best Paper Award of ISVLSI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Full-Frequency Temporal Patching and Structured Masking for Enhanced Audio Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21243v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers and State-Space Models (SSMs) have advanced audio classification by modeling spectrograms as sequences of patches. However, existing models such as the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) and Audio Mamba (AuM) adopt square patching from computer vision, which disrupts continuous frequency patterns and produces an excessive number of patches, slowing training, and increasing computation. We propose Full-Frequency Temporal Patching (FFTP), a patching strategy that better matches the time-frequency asymmetry of spectrograms by spanning full frequency bands with localized temporal context, preserving harmonic structure, and significantly reducing patch count and computation. We also introduce SpecMask, a patch-aligned spectrogram augmentation that combines full-frequency and localized time-frequency masks under a fixed masking budget, enhancing temporal robustness while preserving spectral continuity. When applied on both AST and AuM, our patching method with SpecMask improves mAP by up to +6.76 on AudioSet-18k and accuracy by up to +8.46 on SpeechCommandsV2, while reducing computation by up to 83.26%, demonstrating both performance and efficiency gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Individualized and Interpretable Sleep Forecasting via a Two-Stage Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06974v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sleep quality significantly impacts well-being. Therefore, healthcare providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable, individualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep quality scores. Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional layers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent layers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and a two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first adaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the training set. In the second stage, a source-free test-time adaptation mechanism is employed to adapt the model to new users without requiring labels. We conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day prediction window, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216. Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer forecasting horizons (e.g, with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction window), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.</p></details> |  |

Recent graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks, but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs, preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier methods.</p></details> |  |

Prior studies have noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability. Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES, demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP Findings)</p></details> |

If a planned trajectory violates traffic rules, it is common to replan a new trajectory from scratch. We instead propose a trajectory repair technique to save computation time. By coupling satisfiability modulo theories with set-based reachability analysis, we determine if and in what manner the initial trajectory can be repaired. Experiments in high-fidelity simulators and in the real world demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach in various scenarios. Even in complex environments with intricate rules, we efficiently and reliably repair rule-violating trajectories, enabling automated vehicles to swiftly resume legally safe operation in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE.

Existing methods often face high computational cost or rely on external safety critics. To address this, we propose an Interaction-Enriched Unified Potential Field (IUPF) framework that fuses style-dependent benefit and risk fields through a physics-inspired variational model, grounded in mean field game theory. The approach captures conservative, aggressive, and cooperative behaviors without additional safety modules, and employs stochastic differential equations to guarantee Nash equilibrium with exponential convergence. Simulations on lane changing and overtaking scenarios show that IUPF ensures safe distances, generates smooth and efficient trajectories, and outperforms traditional optimization and game-theoretic baselines in both adaptability and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

The gradient constraint is enforced by thresholding the $\ell_2$-norm of the next gradient vector. The constraints form a quadratic equation. To ensure the existence of the solution, a novel Discrete-Time Forward and Backward Sweep (DTFBS) strategy is proposed. To ensure the existence of the trajectory derivatives, the trajectory function is reparameterized as a piecewise cubic polynomial function with $C^2$ continuity. To ensure trajectory fidelity, the output gradient waveform is reparameterized by the finite difference of the trajectory samples. Simulation experiments across seven commonly adopted non-Cartesian trajectories were conducted to validate generality, time-optimality, real-time capability, slew-rate accuracy, and improvements over prior work. Imaging feasibility of the designed time-optimal gradient waveform was validated in phantom and in vivo experiments. \textbf{Results: }The proposed method achieves a $>89\%$ reduction in computation time and simultaneously reduces slew-rate overshoot by $>98\%$ compared to the prior method across all involved trajectories. The computation time of the proposed method is shorter than the gradient duration for all tested cases, validating the real-time capability of the proposed method. \textbf{Conclusions: }The proposed method enables real-time and hardware-compliant gradient waveform design, achieving significant reductions in computation time and slew-rate overshoot compared to the previous method. \textbf{Significance: }This is the first method achieving real-time gradient waveform design for arbitrary $k$-space trajectories.</p></details> |  |

While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Generalized Hamiltonian Dynamics with Stability from Noisy Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07280v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative, and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics, appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction accuracy with bounded uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot 3D-Aware Trajectory-Guided image-to-video generation via Test-Time Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06723v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets. Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification, which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and zero-shot approaches.</p></details> |  |

Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often assume fixed graph structures and require retraining when network conditions change, making them unsuitable for deployment on constrained hardware. We present TrajAware, an RL-based framework designed for edge AI deployment in VANETs. TrajAware integrates three components: (i) action space pruning, which reduces redundant neighbour options while preserving two-hop reachability, alleviating the curse of dimensionality; (ii) graph cross-attention, which maps pruned neighbours to the global graph context, producing features that generalise across diverse network sizes; and (iii) trajectory-aware prediction, which uses historical routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial observations. We evaluate TrajAware in the open-source SUMO simulator using real-world city maps with a leave-one-city-out setup. Results show that TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Resident fitness computation in linear time and other algorithmic aspects of interacting trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11561v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The notion of a system of interacting trajectories was recently introduced by Hermann, Gonz\'alez Casanova, Soares dos Santos, T\'obi\'as and Wakolbinger. Such a system of $[0,1]$-valued piecewise linear trajectories arises as a scaling limit of the system of logarithmic subpopulation sizes in a population-genetic model (more precisely, a Moran model) with mutation and selection. By definition, the resident fitness is initially 0 and afterwards it increases by the ultimate slope of each trajectory that reaches height 1. We show that although the interaction of $n$ trajectories may yield $\Omega(n^2)$ slope changes in total, the resident fitness function can be computed algorithmically in $O(n)$ time. Our algorithm uses the so-called continued lines representation of the system of interacting trajectories. In the special case of Poissonian interacting trajectories where the birth times of the trajectories form a Poisson process and the initial slopes are random and i.i.d., we provide a linear bound on the expected total number of slope changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v5)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance. The code is available at https://github.com/YvanYin/GoalFlow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical description and dimension reduction of categorical trajectories with multivariate functional principal components](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09986v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many examples in which the statistical units of interest are samples of a continuous time categorical random process, that is to say a continuous time stochastic process taking values in a finite state space. Getting simple representations that allow comparisons of a set of trajectories is of major interest for statisticians. Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical description of the categorical trajectories into a multivariate functional principal components analysis. The (multivariate) covariance operator has nice interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities and the multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, it is simple to build consistent estimators of the covariance kernel and perform multivariate functional principal components analysis. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories are not supposed to be continuous and can be observed exhaustively. The approach is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments. We also show how it can be easily extended to analyze experiments, such as temporal check-all-that-apply, in which two states or more can be observed at the same time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe and Economical UAV Trajectory Planning in Low-Altitude Airspace: A Hybrid DRL-LLM Approach with Compliance Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08532v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of the low-altitude economy has driven the widespread adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This growing deployment presents new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments. However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM) reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate, collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the low-altitude economy networking.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior learning-based methods, ZLATTE leverages Vision-Language Models to register objects as geometric primitives and employs a Large Language Model to translate natural language instructions into explicit geometric and kinematic constraints. These constraints are integrated into a potential field optimization to adapt initial trajectories while preserving feasibility and safety. A multi-agent strategy further enhances robustness under complex or conflicting commands. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that ZLATTE achieves smoother, safer, and more interpretable trajectory modifications compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Scaling of Diffusion Models via Noise Trajectory Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03164v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The iterative and stochastic nature of diffusion models enables test-time scaling, whereby spending additional compute during denoising generates higher-fidelity samples. Increasing the number of denoising steps is the primary scaling axis, but this yields quickly diminishing returns. Instead optimizing the noise trajectory--the sequence of injected noise vectors--is promising, as the specific noise realizations critically affect sample quality; but this is challenging due to a high-dimensional search space, complex noise-outcome interactions, and costly trajectory evaluations. We address this by first casting diffusion as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a terminal reward, showing tree-search methods such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to be meaningful but impractical. To balance performance and efficiency, we then resort to a relaxation of MDP, where we view denoising as a sequence of independent contextual bandits. This allows us to introduce an $\epsilon$-greedy search algorithm that globally explores at extreme timesteps and locally exploits during the intermediate steps where de-mixing occurs. Experiments on EDM and Stable Diffusion reveal state-of-the-art scores for class-conditioned/text-to-image generation, exceeding baselines by up to $164\%$ and matching/exceeding MCTS performance. To our knowledge, this is the first practical method for test-time noise trajectory optimization of arbitrary (non-differentiable) rewards.</p></details> |  |
| **[MENSA: A Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis with Trajectory-based Likelihood Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06525v4)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing time-to-event methods focus on either single-event or competing-risk settings, leaving multi-event scenarios relatively underexplored. In many real-world applications, the same patient may experience multiple events that are non-exclusive, and sometimes semi-competing. A common workaround is to train separate single-event models, but this approach fails to exploit dependencies and shared structure across events. To address these limitations, we propose MENSA (Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis), a deep learning model that jointly models flexible time-to-event distributions for multiple events, whether competing or co-occurring. In addition, we introduce a novel trajectory-based likelihood that captures the temporal ordering between events. Across five benchmark datasets, MENSA consistently improves prediction performance over many state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Efficient Virtuoso: A Latent Diffusion Transformer Model for Goal-Conditioned Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03658v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems. While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity, computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present the Efficient Virtuoso, a conditional latent diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, achieving a minimum Average Displacement Error (minADE) of 0.25. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Effective Trajectory Planning and an Optimized Path Planning for a 6-Degree-of-Freedom Robot Manipulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00828v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An effective method for optimizing path planning for a specific model of a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator is presented as part of the motion planning of the manipulator using computer algebra. We assume that we are given a path in the form of a set of line segments that the end-effector should follow. We also assume that we have a method to solve the inverse kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector. Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by reducing the problem to a shortest-path problem of the graph and applying Dijkstra's algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by experiments.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Learning to Coordinate: Distributed Meta-Trajectory Optimization Via Differentiable ADMM-DDP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01630v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Acceleration Preconditioners for Parametric Radiative Transfer Equations based on Trajectory-Aware Reduced Order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05001v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The parametric radiative transfer equation (RTE) arises in multi-query applications, such as design optimization, inverse problems, and uncertainty quantification, which require solving the RTE multiple times for various parameters. Classical synthetic acceleration (SA) preconditioners are designed based on low-order approximations of a kinetic correction equation, e.g., its diffusion limit in diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA). Despite their widespread success, these methods rely on empirical physical assumptions and do not leverage low-rank structures across parameters of the parametric problem. To address these limitations, our previous work introduced a reduced-order model (ROM) enhanced preconditioner called ROMSAD, which exploits low-rank structures across parameters and the original kinetic description of the correction equation. While ROMSAD improves overall efficiency compared with DSA, its efficiency reduces after the first iteration, because the construction of the underlying ROM ignores the preconditioner-dependence of the residual trajectory, leading to a mismatch between the offline and online residual trajectories. To overcome this issue, we introduce a trajectory-aware framework that iteratively constructs ROMs to eliminate the mismatch between offline and online residual trajectories. Numerical tests demonstrate superior efficiency over DSA, and substantial gains in both efficiency and robustness over ROMSAD. For a parametric lattice problem, trajectory-aware ROM preconditioners achieve rapid convergence within only $2$-$3$ iterations online.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |

While human-motion-centric approaches excel in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods. Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in global human motion reconstruction.

STO maintains the maneuver strategy of the high-level global planner while allowing curvature discontinuities at switching points to improve maneuver efficiency. To ensure safety, a convex corridor is constructed via GJK-accelerated ellipse shrinking and expansion, serving as safety constraints in each iteration. Numerical simulations in perpendicular and reverse-angled parking scenarios demonstrate that STO enhances maneuver efficiency while ensuring safety. Moreover, computational performance confirms its practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

However, traditional IL methods are limited by their reliance on high-quality, often scarce, expert data, and suffer from covariate shift. To address these challenges, recent advances in offline IL have incorporated suboptimal, unlabeled datasets into the training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance policy learning from mixed-quality offline datasets by leveraging task-relevant trajectory fragments and rich environmental dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a state-based search framework that stitches state-action pairs from imperfect demonstrations, generating more diverse and informative training trajectories. Experimental results on standard IL benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks showcase that our proposed method significantly improves both generalization and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can the Waymo Open Motion Dataset Support Realistic Behavioral Modeling? A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03515v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations. Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably, WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving. Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without proper validation against independently collected data.</p></details> |  |

For control purposes, the model is structured as a cascade system, where a rotational subsystem drives a translational one. The rotational subsystem is linear, while the translational subsystem follows a linear-plus-perturbation form, thereby reducing the complexity of control design. A control strategy requiring only simple operations, no memory, and no iterative search loops is presented to illustrate the main features of the GA model. By employing GA to model both translations and rotations, a singularity-free and geometrically intuitive representation can be achieved through the use of the geometric product. Closed-loop stability is rigorously established using input-to-state stability methods. Numerical simulations of a quad tilt-rotorcraft performing trajectory tracking in a windy environment validate the controller's stability and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE TAES for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[KEPT: Knowledge-Enhanced Prediction of Trajectories from Consecutive Driving Frames with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02966v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars. Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion, and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset, KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising, data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

Still, existing data-driven models are constrained mainly to single-vessel forecasting, overlooking vessel interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to strengthen maritime safety and decision support.</p></details> |  |

Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB) objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an illustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods achieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was previously reported.</p></details> |  |

The main obstacle is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for city level, large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial difficulties for road level, small-scale aggregation. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales for static and interactive maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedResearcher-R1: Expert-Level Medical Deep Researcher via A Knowledge-Informed Trajectory Synthesis Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14880v3)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown impressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research systems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking and synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored for medical contexts. We present a medical deep research agent that addresses these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool interactions. Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Metamorphic Testing of Multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01294v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Predicting human trajectories is crucial for the safety and reliability of autonomous systems, such as automated vehicles and mobile robots. However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g., trajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs (multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary difficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future trajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This research presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic methodology for testing multimodal HTP systems. We address the oracle problem through metamorphic relations (MRs) adapted for the complexities and stochastic nature of HTP. Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both historical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an environmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric transformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and map inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2) Map-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing obstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions. We propose probabilistic violation criteria based on distance metrics between probability distributions, such as the Wasserstein or Hellinger distance. Conclusion: This study introduces tool, a MT framework for the oracle-less testing of multimodal, stochastic HTP systems. It allows for assessment of model robustness against input transformations and contextual changes without reliance on ground-truth trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Infor...</summary><p>Information and Software Technology</p></details> |

An innovative geometric indicator, based on the analysis of safety zones using adaptive ellipses, is used to accurately quantify collision risks. Our method applies the Shoelace formula to compute the intersection area in the case of misaligned and time-varying configurations. Comfort is modeled using indicators centered on longitudinal and lateral jerk, while efficiency is assessed by overall travel time. These criteria are aggregated into a comprehensive objective function solved using a PSO based algorithm. The approach was successfully validated under real traffic conditions via experiments conducted in an urban intersection involving an autonomous vehicle interacting with a human-operated vehicle, and in simulation using data recorded from human driving in real traffic.</p></details> |  |
| **[MVTrajecter: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking with Trajectory Motion Cost and Trajectory Appearance Cost](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01157v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association. MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition, MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

While existing trajectory planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i) a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives, providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.</p></details> |  |

Although data acquisition using drones is efficient, existing datasets still have limitations in scene representativeness, information richness, and data fidelity. This study introduces FLUID, comprising a fine-grained trajectory dataset that captures dense conflicts at typical urban signalized intersections, and a lightweight, full-pipeline framework for drone-based trajectory processing. FLUID covers three distinct intersection types, with approximately 5 hours of recording time and featuring over 20,000 TPs across 8 categories. Notably, the dataset averages two vehicle conflicts per minute, involving roughly 25% of all motor vehicles. FLUID provides comprehensive data, including trajectories, traffic signals, maps, and raw videos. Comparison with the DataFromSky platform and ground-truth measurements validates its high spatio-temporal accuracy. Through a detailed classification of motor vehicle conflicts and violations, FLUID reveals a diversity of interactive behaviors, demonstrating its value for human preference mining, traffic behavior modeling, and autonomous driving research.</p></details> | 26 pages, 14 figures |

Using the two-scale Lorenz '96 system as a case study, we develop and train both additive and multiplicative stochastic parametrizations to generate ensemble predictions. Results indicate that CRPS-based trajectory learning produces parametrizations that are both accurate and sharp. The resulting parametrizations are straightforward to calibrate and outperform derivative-fitting-based parametrizations in short-term forecasts.

| **[Temporal Flow Matching for Learning Spatio-Temporal Trajectories in 4D Longitudinal Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21580v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions. While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e. predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports $3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.</p></details> |  |

Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory. This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate superior visual quality compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8page...</summary><p>8pages; 7figures; 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Dynamics-Compliant Trajectory Diffusion for Super-Nominal Payload Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21375v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nominal payload ratings for articulated robots are typically derived from worst-case configurations, resulting in uniform payload constraints across the entire workspace. This conservative approach severely underutilizes the robot's inherent capabilities -- our analysis demonstrates that manipulators can safely handle payloads well above nominal capacity across broad regions of their workspace while staying within joint angle, velocity, acceleration, and torque limits. To address this gap between assumed and actual capability, we propose a novel trajectory generation approach using denoising diffusion models that explicitly incorporates payload constraints into the planning process. Unlike traditional sampling-based methods that rely on inefficient trial-and-error, optimization-based methods that are prohibitively slow, or kinodynamic planners that struggle with problem dimensionality, our approach generates dynamically feasible joint-space trajectories in constant time that can be directly executed on physical hardware without post-processing. Experimental validation on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that up to 67.6% of the workspace remains accessible even with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal capacity. This expanded operational envelope highlights the importance of a more nuanced consideration of payload dynamics in motion planning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 Conference on Robot Learning [CoRL]</p></details> |
| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manifold Trajectories in Next-Token Prediction: From Replicator Dynamics to Softmax Equilibrium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21186v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comparative Study of Spline-Based Trajectory Reconstruction Methods Across Varying Automatic Vehicle Location Data Densities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00119v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic vehicle location (AVL) data offers insights into transit dynamics, but its effectiveness is often hampered by inconsistent update frequencies, necessitating trajectory reconstruction. This research evaluates 13 trajectory reconstruction methods, including several novel approaches, using high-resolution AVL data from Austin, Texas. We examine the interplay of four critical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on reconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of these methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the trade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework combines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity with practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning velocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed variability). In addition, we provide insight into the relative value of each method in calculating realistic metrics for infrastructure evaluations. Our findings indicate that velocity-aware methods consistently outperform position-only approaches. Interestingly, we discovered that smoothing-based methods can degrade overall performance in complex, congested urban environments, although enforcing monotonicity remains critical. The velocity constrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME) yields optimal results, offering a balance between high accuracy and computational efficiency. Its minimal overhead makes it suitable for both historical analysis and real-time applications, providing significant predictive power when combined with dense datasets. These findings offer practical guidance for researchers and practitioners implementing trajectory reconstruction systems and emphasize the importance of investing in higher-frequency AVL data collection for improved analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeMat-Traj: A Scalable and Unified Dataset of Materials Trajectories for Atomistic Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20875v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs. LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued evolution of large-scale materials datasets.

However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher.

The investigation of these dynamics can provide a better understanding of diffusing objects and their surrounding media, but a quantitative characterization from individual trajectories is often challenging. Efforts devoted to improving anomalous diffusion detection using classical statistics and machine learning have produced several new methods. Recently, the anomalous diffusion challenge (AnDi, www.andi-challenge.org) was launched to objectively assess these approaches on a common dataset, focusing on three aspects of anomalous diffusion: the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent; the classification of the diffusion model; and the segmentation of trajectories. In this article, I describe a simple approach to tackle the tasks of the AnDi challenge by combining extreme learning machine and feature engineering (AnDi-ELM). The method reaches satisfactory performance while offering a straightforward implementation and fast training time with limited computing resources, making it a suitable tool for fast preliminary screening of anomalous diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Ego-centric Predictive Model Conditioned on Hand Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19852v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In egocentric scenarios, anticipating both the next action and its visual outcome is essential for understanding human-object interactions and for enabling robotic planning. However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly modeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action prediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual scene, while video prediction models generate future frames without conditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or contextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified two-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in egocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we perform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual observations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce causal cross-attention to fuse multi-modal cues, leveraging inferred action signals to guide an image-based Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for frame-by-frame future video generation. Our approach is the first unified model designed to handle both egocentric human activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit predictions of both upcoming actions and their visual consequences.

To provide an optimized solution, we propose a cooperative trajectory optimization and task allocation framework leveraging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). This study integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for efficient task allocation among multiple UAVs and UGVs, and employs an informed-RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) algorithm for collision-free trajectory generation. Further optimization of task sequencing and path efficiency is conducted using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Simulation experiments conducted in a realistic post-disaster environment demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves the overall efficiency of medical rescue operations compared to traditional strategies. Specifically, our method reduces the total mission completion time to 26.7 minutes for a 15-task scenario, outperforming K-Means clustering and random allocation by over 73%. Furthermore, the framework achieves a substantial 15.1% reduction in total traveled distance after CMA-ES optimization. The cooperative utilization of UAVs and UGVs effectively balances their complementary advantages, highlighting the system's scalability and practicality for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Trust Region Sequential Convex Optimization for Multi-Drone Thermal Screening Trajectory Planning in Urban Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06012v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is essential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas.

| **[Coresets from Trajectories: Selecting Data via Correlation of Loss Differences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20230v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k, CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with <1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints, incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled, efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.</p></details> |  |

Belief-space planners address this by propagating pose-belief covariance through analytic models and switching sensors heuristically--a brittle, runtime-expensive approach. Data-driven approaches--including diffusion models--learn multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, but presuppose an accurate, always-on state estimate. We address the largely open problem: for a given task in a mapped environment, which \textit{minimal sensor subset} must be active at each location to maintain state uncertainty \textit{just low enough} to complete the task? Our key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error. Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion (B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for localisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this single proxy suffices for a soft-actor-critic to choose sensors online, optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth. We deploy B-COD in real-time marine trials on an unmanned surface vehicle and show that it reduces sensing energy consumption while matching the goal-reach performance of an always-on baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025 (Conference on Robot Learning)</p></details> |

The task of predicting pedestrian crossing intention involves determining whether pedestrians in the scene are likely to cross the road or not. In this work, we propose TrajFusionNet, a novel transformer-based model that combines future pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed predictions as priors for predicting crossing intention. TrajFusionNet comprises two branches: a Sequence Attention Module (SAM) and a Visual Attention Module (VAM). The SAM branch learns from a sequential representation of the observed and predicted pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed. Complementarily, the VAM branch enables learning from a visual representation of the predicted pedestrian trajectory by overlaying predicted pedestrian bounding boxes onto scene images.

| **[GTPO: Trajectory-Based Policy Optimization in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03772v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline (TAP), a scalable and automated method for extracting SDL labels from large trajectory datasets. TAP applies a rules-based cross-entropy optimization approach to learn parameters directly from data, enhancing generalization across diverse driving contexts. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), TAP achieves 30% greater precision than Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 24% over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in identifying behaviorally similar trajectories. Additionally, TAP enables automated detection of unique driving behaviors, streamlining safety evaluation processes for AV testing. This work provides a foundation for scalable scenario-based AV behavior analysis, with potential extensions for integrating multi-agent contexts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **["Where does it hurt?" -- Dataset and Study on Physician Intent Trajectories in Doctor Patient Dialogues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19077v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a doctor-patient dialogue, the primary objective of physicians is to diagnose patients and propose a treatment plan. Medical doctors guide these conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including annotation guidelines, publicly available at https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Preliminary Study on Space Utilization and Emergent Behaviors of Group vs. Single Pedestrians in Real-World Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18939v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process. To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change, motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single, single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200 frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space design validation in crowd dynamics research.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as 3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics, STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Dynamic Trajectory Optimization and Power Control for Hierarchical UAV Swarms in 6G Aerial Access Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18702v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can serve as aerial base stations (BSs) to extend the ubiquitous connectivity for ground users (GUs) in the sixth-generation (6G) era. However, it is challenging to cooperatively deploy multiple UAV swarms in large-scale remote areas. Hence, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical UAV swarms structure for 6G aerial access networks, where the head UAVs serve as aerial BSs, and tail UAVs (T-UAVs) are responsible for relay. In detail, we jointly optimize the dynamic deployment and trajectory of UAV swarms, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) to concurrently minimize the energy consumption of UAV swarms and GUs, as well as the delay of GUs. However, the proposed MOP is a mixed integer nonlinear programming and NP-hard to solve. Therefore, we develop a K-means and Voronoi diagram based area division method, and construct Fermat points to establish connections between GUs and T-UAVs. Then, an improved non-dominated sorting whale optimization algorithm is proposed to seek Pareto optimal solutions for the transformed MOP. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the performance of proposed algorithms by comparing with baseline mechanisms, resulting in a 50% complexity reduction.</p></details> |  |

Our framework features a unified trajectory representation that encapsulates the kinematic models of both $SO(3)\times\mathbb{R}^3$ and $SE(3)$ pose representations. This encapsulation strategy allows users to use the same implementation of measurement-based factors for either choice of pose representation, which facilitates experimentation and comparison to achieve the best model for the ME task. In addition, unique to our framework, we derive the kinematic models with the closed-form temporal derivatives of the local variable of $SO(3)$ and $SE(3)$, which so far has only been approximated based on the Taylor expansion in the literature. Our experiments show that these kinematic models can improve the estimation accuracy in high-speed scenarios. All analytical Jacobians of the interpolated states with respect to the support states of the trajectory representation, as well as the motion prior factors, are also provided for accelerated Gauss-Newton (GN) optimization. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the framework in various motion estimation tasks such as localization, calibration, and odometry, facilitating fast prototyping for ME researchers. We release the source code for the benefit of the community.

Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by 32.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website is at: https://denghaoyuan123.github.io/SafeBimanip/</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Output Steps: FlexiSteps Network for Dynamic Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17797v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is vital for autonomous driving, robotics, and intelligent decision-making systems, yet traditional models typically rely on fixed-length output predictions, limiting their adaptability to dynamic real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the FlexiSteps Network (FSN), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts prediction output time steps based on varying contextual conditions. Inspired by recent advancements addressing observation length discrepancies and dynamic feature extraction, FSN incorporates an pre-trained Adaptive Prediction Module (APM) to evaluate and adjust the output steps dynamically, ensuring optimal prediction accuracy and efficiency. To guarantee the plug-and-play of our FSN, we also design a Dynamic Decoder(DD). Additionally, to balance the prediction time steps and prediction accuracy, we design a scoring mechanism, which not only introduces the Fr\'echet distance to evaluate the geometric similarity between the predicted trajectories and the ground truth trajectories but the length of predicted steps is also considered. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including Argoverse and INTERACTION demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed FSN framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traj-MLLM: Can Multimodal Large Language Models Reform Trajectory Data Mining?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00053v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building a general model capable of analyzing human trajectories across different geographic regions and different tasks becomes an emergent yet important problem for various applications. However, existing works suffer from the generalization problem, \ie, they are either restricted to train for specific regions or only suitable for a few tasks. Given the recent advances of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we raise the question: can MLLMs reform current trajectory data mining and solve the problem? Nevertheless, due to the modality gap of trajectory, how to generate task-independent multimodal trajectory representations and how to adapt flexibly to different tasks remain the foundational challenges. In this paper, we propose \texttt{Traj-MLLM}}, which is the first general framework using MLLMs for trajectory data mining. By integrating multiview contexts, \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} transforms raw trajectories into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving key spatial-temporal characteristics, and directly utilizes the reasoning ability of MLLMs for trajectory analysis. Additionally, a prompt optimization method is proposed to finalize data-invariant prompts for task adaptation. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets show that \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $48.05\%$, $15.52\%$, $51.52\%$, $1.83\%$ on travel time estimation, mobility prediction, anomaly detection and transportation mode identification, respectively. \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} achieves these superior performances without requiring any training data or fine-tuning the MLLM backbones.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |
| **[OmniCache: A Trajectory-Oriented Global Perspective on Training-Free Cache Reuse for Diffusion Transformer Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16212v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure. In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Preference Trajectory Modeling via Flow Matching for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17618v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation predicts each user's next item based on their historical interaction sequence. Recently, diffusion models have attracted significant attention in this area due to their strong ability to model user interest distributions. They typically generate target items by denoising Gaussian noise conditioned on historical interactions. However, these models face two critical limitations. First, they exhibit high sensitivity to the condition, making it difficult to recover target items from pure Gaussian noise. Second, the inference process is computationally expensive, limiting practical deployment. To address these issues, we propose FlowRec, a simple yet effective sequential recommendation framework which leverages flow matching to explicitly model user preference trajectories from current states to future interests. Flow matching is an emerging generative paradigm, which offers greater flexibility in initial distributions and enables more efficient sampling. Based on this, we construct a personalized behavior-based prior distribution to replace Gaussian noise and learn a vector field to model user preference trajectories. To better align flow matching with the recommendation objective, we further design a single-step alignment loss incorporating both positive and negative samples, improving sampling efficiency and generation quality. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the superiority of FlowRec over the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v5)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/JARVIS-Xs/SE-Agent.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional heuristics for branching often fail to generalize across heterogeneous problem instances, while existing learning-based methods such as imitation learning (IL) suffers from dependence on expert demonstration quality, and reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with limitations in sparse rewards and dynamic state representation challenges. To address these issues, we propose ReviBranch, a novel deep RL framework that constructs revived trajectories by reviving explicit historical correspondences between branching decisions and their corresponding graph states along search-tree paths. During training, ReviBranch enables agents to learn from complete structural evolution and temporal dependencies within the branching process. Additionally, we introduce an importance-weighted reward redistribution mechanism that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense stepwise feedback, addressing the sparse reward challenge. Extensive experiments on different MILP benchmarks demonstrate that ReviBranch outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, reducing B&B nodes by 4.0% and LP iterations by 2.2% on large-scale instances. The results highlight the robustness and generalizability of ReviBranch across heterogeneous MILP problem classes.</p></details> | conference |

Natural language enables users to express these adjustments in an interactive manner. We introduce OVITA, an interpretable, open-vocabulary, language-driven framework designed for adapting robot trajectories in dynamic and novel situations based on human instructions. OVITA leverages multiple pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate user commands into trajectories generated by motion planners or those learned through demonstrations. OVITA employs code as an adaptation policy generated by an LLM, enabling users to adjust individual waypoints, thus providing flexible control. Another LLM, which acts as a code explainer, removes the need for expert users, enabling intuitive interactions. The efficacy and significance of the proposed OVITA framework is demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-world environments with diverse tasks involving spatiotemporal variations on heterogeneous robotic platforms such as a KUKA IIWA robot manipulator, Clearpath Jackal ground robot, and CrazyFlie drone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics and Automation Letters 2025.

Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG) representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF) design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups, and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving high fidelity along the original trajectory.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Rapid Iterative Trajectory Planning Method for Automated Parking through Differential Flatness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17038v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous driving continues to advance, automated parking is becoming increasingly essential. However, significant challenges arise when implementing path velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking. The primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory planning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves maintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory, particularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based rapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above challenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time efficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance framework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned trajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal smoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the proposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path adheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to maintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility of the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time efficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other iteration-based trajectory planning methods. In the real-world experiment, the proposed method was implemented and validated on a ROS-based vehicle, demonstrating the applicability of the RITP method for real vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the journal Robotics and Autonomous Systems</p></details> |

Through the Agentic RAG, the LLM autonomously interprets high-level task requirements and identifies the key components necessary for trajectory optimization, including model inputs and outputs, network architecture, reward functions, and task constraints. To support efficient modeling across different system scales, we introduce the Mamba-Attention Integrated Transformer (MAIT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines the long-range dependency modeling capability of attention mechanisms with the efficient temporal dynamic representation of Mamba. Furthermore, a Trajectory-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) method is proposed to achieve unified policy gradient optimization in both discrete and continuous trajectory spaces for MAIT training.

| **[Integrated Take-off Management and Trajectory Optimization for Merging Control in Urban Air Mobility Corridors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15395v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has the potential to revolutionize daily transportation, offering rapid and efficient aerial mobility services. Take-off and merging phases are critical for air corridor operations, requiring the coordination of take-off aircraft and corridor traffic while ensuring safety and seamless transition. This paper proposes an integrated take-off management and trajectory optimization for merging control in UAM corridors. We first introduce a novel take-off airspace design. To our knowledge, this paper is one of the first to propose a structured design for take-off airspace. Based on the take-off airspace design, we devise a hierarchical coordinated take-off and merging management (HCTMM) strategy. To be specific, the take-off airspace design can simplify aircraft dynamics and thus reduce the dimensionality of the trajectory optimization problem whilst mitigating obstacle avoidance complexities. The HCTMM strategy strictly ensures safety and improves the efficiency of take-off and merging operations. At the tactical level, a scheduling algorithm coordinates aircraft take-off times and selects dynamic merging points to reduce conflicts and ensure smooth take-off and merging processes. At the operational level, a trajectory optimization strategy ensures that each aircraft reaches the dynamic merging point efficiently while satisfying safety constraints. Simulation results show that, compared to representative strategies with fixed or dynamic merging points, the HCTMM strategy significantly improves operational efficiency and reduces computational burden, while ensuring safety under various corridor traffic conditions. Further results confirm the scalability of the HCTMM strategy and the computational efficiency enabled by the proposed take-off airspace design.</p></details> | 31 pages |

Most models predict chronological age, an imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here, we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns. Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance. In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical information to reduce replanning time. Simulation results show that TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Even though most traffic accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention, as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions -- and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.</p></details> |  |

Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and most existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by UAI 2025.

The objective is to assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future inland waterways navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Tracking and Stabilization of Quadrotors Using Deep Koopman Model Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13795v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a data-driven control framework for quadrotor systems that integrates a deep Koopman operator with model predictive control (DK-MPC). The deep Koopman operator is trained on sampled flight data to construct a high-dimensional latent representation in which the nonlinear quadrotor dynamics are approximated by linear models. This linearization enables the application of MPC to efficiently optimize control actions over a finite prediction horizon, ensuring accurate trajectory tracking and stabilization. The proposed DK-MPC approach is validated through a series of trajectory-following and point-stabilization numerical experiments, where it demonstrates superior tracking accuracy and significantly lower computation time compared to conventional nonlinear MPC. These results highlight the potential of Koopman-based learning methods to handle complex quadrotor dynamics while meeting the real-time requirements of embedded flight control. Future work will focus on extending the framework to more agile flight scenarios and improving robustness against external disturbances.</p></details> |  |

We introduce BiND (Bimanual Neural Discriminator-Decoder), a two-stage model that first classifies motion type (unimanual left, unimanual right, or bimanual) and then uses specialized GRU-based decoders, augmented with a trial-relative time index, to predict continuous 2D hand velocities. We benchmark BiND against six state-of-the-art models (SVR, XGBoost, FNN, CNN, Transformer, GRU) on a publicly available 13-session intracortical dataset from a tetraplegic patient. BiND achieves a mean $R^2$ of 0.76 ($\pm$0.01) for unimanual and 0.69 ($\pm$0.03) for bimanual trajectory prediction, surpassing the next-best model (GRU) by 2% in both tasks. It also demonstrates greater robustness to session variability than all other benchmarked models, with accuracy improvements of up to 4% compared to GRU in cross-session analyses. This highlights the effectiveness of task-aware discrimination and temporal modeling in enhancing bimanual decoding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Neural Engineering (NER) Conference'25</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Machine Learning Model with a Constrained Action Space for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03666v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial to advance autonomous driving, improving safety, and efficiency. Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2025 IEEE.

| **[Rapid Urban Visibility Hotspots: Quantifying Building Vertex Visibility from Connected Vehicle Trajectories using Spatial Indexing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03365v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective placement of Out-of-Home advertising and street furniture requires accurate identification of locations offering maximum visual exposure to target audiences, particularly vehicular traffic. Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Tube Visualization of Particle Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13505v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel, computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.</p></details> |  |

If a planned trajectory violates traffic rules, it is common to replan a new trajectory from scratch. We instead propose a trajectory repair technique to save computation time. By coupling satisfiability modulo theories with set-based reachability analysis, we determine if and in what manner the initial trajectory can be repaired. Experiments in high-fidelity simulators and in the real world demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach in various scenarios. Even in complex environments with intricate rules, we efficiently and reliably repair rule-violating trajectories, enabling automated vehicles to swiftly resume legally safe operation in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE.

Existing methods often face high computational cost or rely on external safety critics. To address this, we propose an Interaction-Enriched Unified Potential Field (IUPF) framework that fuses style-dependent benefit and risk fields through a physics-inspired variational model, grounded in mean field game theory. The approach captures conservative, aggressive, and cooperative behaviors without additional safety modules, and employs stochastic differential equations to guarantee Nash equilibrium with exponential convergence. Simulations on lane changing and overtaking scenarios show that IUPF ensures safe distances, generates smooth and efficient trajectories, and outperforms traditional optimization and game-theoretic baselines in both adaptability and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

| **[Real-Time Gradient Waveform Design for Arbitrary $k$-Space Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21625v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>\textbf{Objective: }To develop a real-time method for designing gradient waveforms for arbitrary $k$-space trajectories that are time-optimal and hardware-compliant. \textbf{Methods: }The gradient waveform is solved recursively under both the slew-rate and the trajectory constraints. The gradient constraint is enforced by thresholding the $\ell_2$-norm of the next gradient vector. The constraints form a quadratic equation. To ensure the existence of the solution, a novel Discrete-Time Forward and Backward Sweep (DTFBS) strategy is proposed. To ensure the existence of the trajectory derivatives, the trajectory function is reparameterized as a piecewise cubic polynomial function with $C^2$ continuity. To ensure trajectory fidelity, the output gradient waveform is reparameterized by the finite difference of the trajectory samples. Simulation experiments across seven commonly adopted non-Cartesian trajectories were conducted to validate generality, time-optimality, real-time capability, slew-rate accuracy, and improvements over prior work. Imaging feasibility of the designed time-optimal gradient waveform was validated in phantom and in vivo experiments. \textbf{Results: }The proposed method achieves a $>89\%$ reduction in computation time and simultaneously reduces slew-rate overshoot by $>98\%$ compared to the prior method across all involved trajectories. The computation time of the proposed method is shorter than the gradient duration for all tested cases, validating the real-time capability of the proposed method. \textbf{Conclusions: }The proposed method enables real-time and hardware-compliant gradient waveform design, achieving significant reductions in computation time and slew-rate overshoot compared to the previous method. \textbf{Significance: }This is the first method achieving real-time gradient waveform design for arbitrary $k$-space trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Resource Estimation and Trajectory Optimization for eVTOL-involved CR network: A Monte Carlo Tree Search-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18031v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, pivotal to Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), are emerging as a transformative transportation paradigm with the potential to redefine urban and regional mobility. While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Generalized Hamiltonian Dynamics with Stability from Noisy Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07280v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative, and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics, appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction accuracy with bounded uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot 3D-Aware Trajectory-Guided image-to-video generation via Test-Time Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06723v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets. Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification, which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and zero-shot approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajAware: Graph Cross-Attention and Trajectory-Aware for Generalisable VANETs under Partial Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06665v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are a crucial component of intelligent transportation systems; however, routing remains challenging due to dynamic topologies, incomplete observations, and the limited resources of edge devices. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often assume fixed graph structures and require retraining when network conditions change, making them unsuitable for deployment on constrained hardware. We present TrajAware, an RL-based framework designed for edge AI deployment in VANETs. TrajAware integrates three components: (i) action space pruning, which reduces redundant neighbour options while preserving two-hop reachability, alleviating the curse of dimensionality; (ii) graph cross-attention, which maps pruned neighbours to the global graph context, producing features that generalise across diverse network sizes; and (iii) trajectory-aware prediction, which uses historical routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial observations. We evaluate TrajAware in the open-source SUMO simulator using real-world city maps with a leave-one-city-out setup. Results show that TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Resident fitness computation in linear time and other algorithmic aspects of interacting trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11561v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The notion of a system of interacting trajectories was recently introduced by Hermann, Gonz\'alez Casanova, Soares dos Santos, T\'obi\'as and Wakolbinger. Such a system of $[0,1]$-valued piecewise linear trajectories arises as a scaling limit of the system of logarithmic subpopulation sizes in a population-genetic model (more precisely, a Moran model) with mutation and selection. By definition, the resident fitness is initially 0 and afterwards it increases by the ultimate slope of each trajectory that reaches height 1. We show that although the interaction of $n$ trajectories may yield $\Omega(n^2)$ slope changes in total, the resident fitness function can be computed algorithmically in $O(n)$ time. Our algorithm uses the so-called continued lines representation of the system of interacting trajectories. In the special case of Poissonian interacting trajectories where the birth times of the trajectories form a Poisson process and the initial slopes are random and i.i.d., we provide a linear bound on the expected total number of slope changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v5)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

| **[Statistical description and dimension reduction of categorical trajectories with multivariate functional principal components](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09986v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many examples in which the statistical units of interest are samples of a continuous time categorical random process, that is to say a continuous time stochastic process taking values in a finite state space. Getting simple representations that allow comparisons of a set of trajectories is of major interest for statisticians. Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical description of the categorical trajectories into a multivariate functional principal components analysis. The (multivariate) covariance operator has nice interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities and the multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, it is simple to build consistent estimators of the covariance kernel and perform multivariate functional principal components analysis. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories are not supposed to be continuous and can be observed exhaustively. The approach is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments. We also show how it can be easily extended to analyze experiments, such as temporal check-all-that-apply, in which two states or more can be observed at the same time.</p></details> |  |

This growing deployment presents new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments. However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM) reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate, collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the low-altitude economy networking.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior learning-based methods, ZLATTE leverages Vision-Language Models to register objects as geometric primitives and employs a Large Language Model to translate natural language instructions into explicit geometric and kinematic constraints. These constraints are integrated into a potential field optimization to adapt initial trajectories while preserving feasibility and safety. A multi-agent strategy further enhances robustness under complex or conflicting commands. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that ZLATTE achieves smoother, safer, and more interpretable trajectory modifications compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Scaling of Diffusion Models via Noise Trajectory Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03164v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The iterative and stochastic nature of diffusion models enables test-time scaling, whereby spending additional compute during denoising generates higher-fidelity samples. Increasing the number of denoising steps is the primary scaling axis, but this yields quickly diminishing returns. Instead optimizing the noise trajectory--the sequence of injected noise vectors--is promising, as the specific noise realizations critically affect sample quality; but this is challenging due to a high-dimensional search space, complex noise-outcome interactions, and costly trajectory evaluations. We address this by first casting diffusion as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a terminal reward, showing tree-search methods such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to be meaningful but impractical. To balance performance and efficiency, we then resort to a relaxation of MDP, where we view denoising as a sequence of independent contextual bandits. This allows us to introduce an $\epsilon$-greedy search algorithm that globally explores at extreme timesteps and locally exploits during the intermediate steps where de-mixing occurs. Experiments on EDM and Stable Diffusion reveal state-of-the-art scores for class-conditioned/text-to-image generation, exceeding baselines by up to $164\%$ and matching/exceeding MCTS performance. To our knowledge, this is the first practical method for test-time noise trajectory optimization of arbitrary (non-differentiable) rewards.</p></details> |  |
| **[MENSA: A Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis with Trajectory-based Likelihood Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06525v4)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing time-to-event methods focus on either single-event or competing-risk settings, leaving multi-event scenarios relatively underexplored. In many real-world applications, the same patient may experience multiple events that are non-exclusive, and sometimes semi-competing. A common workaround is to train separate single-event models, but this approach fails to exploit dependencies and shared structure across events. To address these limitations, we propose MENSA (Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis), a deep learning model that jointly models flexible time-to-event distributions for multiple events, whether competing or co-occurring. In addition, we introduce a novel trajectory-based likelihood that captures the temporal ordering between events. Across five benchmark datasets, MENSA consistently improves prediction performance over many state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Efficient Virtuoso: A Latent Diffusion Transformer Model for Goal-Conditioned Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03658v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems. While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity, computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present the Efficient Virtuoso, a conditional latent diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, achieving a minimum Average Displacement Error (minADE) of 0.25. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.</p></details> |  |

We assume that we are given a path in the form of a set of line segments that the end-effector should follow. We also assume that we have a method to solve the inverse kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector. Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by reducing the problem to a shortest-path problem of the graph and applying Dijkstra's algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by experiments.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Learning to Coordinate: Distributed Meta-Trajectory Optimization Via Differentiable ADMM-DDP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01630v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Acceleration Preconditioners for Parametric Radiative Transfer Equations based on Trajectory-Aware Reduced Order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05001v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The parametric radiative transfer equation (RTE) arises in multi-query applications, such as design optimization, inverse problems, and uncertainty quantification, which require solving the RTE multiple times for various parameters. Classical synthetic acceleration (SA) preconditioners are designed based on low-order approximations of a kinetic correction equation, e.g., its diffusion limit in diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA). Despite their widespread success, these methods rely on empirical physical assumptions and do not leverage low-rank structures across parameters of the parametric problem. To address these limitations, our previous work introduced a reduced-order model (ROM) enhanced preconditioner called ROMSAD, which exploits low-rank structures across parameters and the original kinetic description of the correction equation. While ROMSAD improves overall efficiency compared with DSA, its efficiency reduces after the first iteration, because the construction of the underlying ROM ignores the preconditioner-dependence of the residual trajectory, leading to a mismatch between the offline and online residual trajectories. To overcome this issue, we introduce a trajectory-aware framework that iteratively constructs ROMs to eliminate the mismatch between offline and online residual trajectories. Numerical tests demonstrate superior efficiency over DSA, and substantial gains in both efficiency and robustness over ROMSAD. For a parametric lattice problem, trajectory-aware ROM preconditioners achieve rapid convergence within only $2$-$3$ iterations online.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |

While human-motion-centric approaches excel in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods. Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.</p></details> |  |

STO maintains the maneuver strategy of the high-level global planner while allowing curvature discontinuities at switching points to improve maneuver efficiency. To ensure safety, a convex corridor is constructed via GJK-accelerated ellipse shrinking and expansion, serving as safety constraints in each iteration. Numerical simulations in perpendicular and reverse-angled parking scenarios demonstrate that STO enhances maneuver efficiency while ensuring safety. Moreover, computational performance confirms its practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

However, traditional IL methods are limited by their reliance on high-quality, often scarce, expert data, and suffer from covariate shift. To address these challenges, recent advances in offline IL have incorporated suboptimal, unlabeled datasets into the training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance policy learning from mixed-quality offline datasets by leveraging task-relevant trajectory fragments and rich environmental dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a state-based search framework that stitches state-action pairs from imperfect demonstrations, generating more diverse and informative training trajectories. Experimental results on standard IL benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks showcase that our proposed method significantly improves both generalization and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can the Waymo Open Motion Dataset Support Realistic Behavioral Modeling? A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03515v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations. Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably, WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving. Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without proper validation against independently collected data.</p></details> |  |

For control purposes, the model is structured as a cascade system, where a rotational subsystem drives a translational one. The rotational subsystem is linear, while the translational subsystem follows a linear-plus-perturbation form, thereby reducing the complexity of control design. A control strategy requiring only simple operations, no memory, and no iterative search loops is presented to illustrate the main features of the GA model. By employing GA to model both translations and rotations, a singularity-free and geometrically intuitive representation can be achieved through the use of the geometric product. Closed-loop stability is rigorously established using input-to-state stability methods. Numerical simulations of a quad tilt-rotorcraft performing trajectory tracking in a windy environment validate the controller's stability and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE TAES for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[KEPT: Knowledge-Enhanced Prediction of Trajectories from Consecutive Driving Frames with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02966v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars. Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion, and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset, KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising, data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

How about solving such a problem at an incredibly fast computational time? On a small form-factor processor? Algorithmic details that make possible this trifecta of breakthroughs are presented in this paper. The computational mathematics that deliver these advancements are: (i) a Birkhoff-theoretic discretization of optimal control problems, (ii) matrix-free linear algebra leveraging Krylov-subspace methods, and (iii) a near-perfect Birkhoff preconditioner that helps achieve $\mathcal{O}(1)$ iteration speed with respect to the grid size,~$N$. A key enabler of this high performance is the computation of Birkhoff matrix-vector products at $\mathcal{O}(N\log(N))$ time using fast Fourier transform techniques that eliminate traditional computational bottlenecks. A numerical demonstration of this unprecedented scale and speed is illustrated for a practical astrodynamics problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, AAS Paper 25-689</p></details> |
| **[Multi-vessel Interaction-Aware Trajectory Prediction and Collision Risk Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01836v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is essential for enhancing situational awareness and preventing collisions. Still, existing data-driven models are constrained mainly to single-vessel forecasting, overlooking vessel interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to strengthen maritime safety and decision support.</p></details> |  |

An MPC strategy based on a 12-dimensional prediction model is proposed for the outer loop, explicitly accounting for time-varying coupled constraints, where multiple variables are interdependent and need to be handled together. The outer-loop controller generates an acceleration reference, which is then converted into attitude and angular velocity references, later tracked by a nonlinear inner-loop controller. Numerical simulations validate the approach, demonstrating enhanced performance in precise and fast tracking by imposing less conservative constraints than existing approaches, while still guaranteeing stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, submitted to 2025 IEEE 64th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)</p></details> |
| **[Relative Trajectory Balance is equivalent to Trust-PCL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01632v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in generative modeling has highlighted the importance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning, with KL-regularized methods in particular proving to be highly effective for both autoregressive and diffusion models. Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB) objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an illustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods achieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was previously reported.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using iterated local alignment to aggregate trajectory data into a traffic flow map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17500v6)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectories are a promising GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data source to compute multi-scale traffic flow maps ranging from the city/regional level to the road level. The main obstacle is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for city level, large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial difficulties for road level, small-scale aggregation. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales for static and interactive maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedResearcher-R1: Expert-Level Medical Deep Researcher via A Knowledge-Informed Trajectory Synthesis Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14880v3)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown impressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research systems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking and synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored for medical contexts. We present a medical deep research agent that addresses these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool interactions. Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Metamorphic Testing of Multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01294v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Predicting human trajectories is crucial for the safety and reliability of autonomous systems, such as automated vehicles and mobile robots. However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g., trajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs (multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary difficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future trajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This research presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic methodology for testing multimodal HTP systems. We address the oracle problem through metamorphic relations (MRs) adapted for the complexities and stochastic nature of HTP. Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both historical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an environmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric transformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and map inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2) Map-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing obstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions. We propose probabilistic violation criteria based on distance metrics between probability distributions, such as the Wasserstein or Hellinger distance. Conclusion: This study introduces tool, a MT framework for the oracle-less testing of multimodal, stochastic HTP systems. It allows for assessment of model robustness against input transformations and contextual changes without reliance on ground-truth trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Infor...</summary><p>Information and Software Technology</p></details> |

An innovative geometric indicator, based on the analysis of safety zones using adaptive ellipses, is used to accurately quantify collision risks. Our method applies the Shoelace formula to compute the intersection area in the case of misaligned and time-varying configurations. Comfort is modeled using indicators centered on longitudinal and lateral jerk, while efficiency is assessed by overall travel time. These criteria are aggregated into a comprehensive objective function solved using a PSO based algorithm. The approach was successfully validated under real traffic conditions via experiments conducted in an urban intersection involving an autonomous vehicle interacting with a human-operated vehicle, and in simulation using data recorded from human driving in real traffic.</p></details> |  |

End-to-end methods that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association. MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition, MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

While existing trajectory planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i) a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives, providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.</p></details> |  |

Although data acquisition using drones is efficient, existing datasets still have limitations in scene representativeness, information richness, and data fidelity. This study introduces FLUID, comprising a fine-grained trajectory dataset that captures dense conflicts at typical urban signalized intersections, and a lightweight, full-pipeline framework for drone-based trajectory processing. FLUID covers three distinct intersection types, with approximately 5 hours of recording time and featuring over 20,000 TPs across 8 categories. Notably, the dataset averages two vehicle conflicts per minute, involving roughly 25% of all motor vehicles. FLUID provides comprehensive data, including trajectories, traffic signals, maps, and raw videos. Comparison with the DataFromSky platform and ground-truth measurements validates its high spatio-temporal accuracy. Through a detailed classification of motor vehicle conflicts and violations, FLUID reveals a diversity of interactive behaviors, demonstrating its value for human preference mining, traffic behavior modeling, and autonomous driving research.</p></details> | 26 pages, 14 figures |

However, most deep learning methods either consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions. While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e. predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports $3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.</p></details> |  |

Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory. This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate superior visual quality compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8page...</summary><p>8pages; 7figures; 4 tables</p></details> |

This conservative approach severely underutilizes the robot's inherent capabilities -- our analysis demonstrates that manipulators can safely handle payloads well above nominal capacity across broad regions of their workspace while staying within joint angle, velocity, acceleration, and torque limits. To address this gap between assumed and actual capability, we propose a novel trajectory generation approach using denoising diffusion models that explicitly incorporates payload constraints into the planning process. Unlike traditional sampling-based methods that rely on inefficient trial-and-error, optimization-based methods that are prohibitively slow, or kinodynamic planners that struggle with problem dimensionality, our approach generates dynamically feasible joint-space trajectories in constant time that can be directly executed on physical hardware without post-processing. Experimental validation on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that up to 67.6% of the workspace remains accessible even with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal capacity. This expanded operational envelope highlights the importance of a more nuanced consideration of payload dynamics in motion planning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 Conference on Robot Learning [CoRL]</p></details> |
| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manifold Trajectories in Next-Token Prediction: From Replicator Dynamics to Softmax Equilibrium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21186v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comparative Study of Spline-Based Trajectory Reconstruction Methods Across Varying Automatic Vehicle Location Data Densities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00119v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic vehicle location (AVL) data offers insights into transit dynamics, but its effectiveness is often hampered by inconsistent update frequencies, necessitating trajectory reconstruction. This research evaluates 13 trajectory reconstruction methods, including several novel approaches, using high-resolution AVL data from Austin, Texas. We examine the interplay of four critical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on reconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of these methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the trade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework combines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity with practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning velocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed variability). In addition, we provide insight into the relative value of each method in calculating realistic metrics for infrastructure evaluations. Our findings indicate that velocity-aware methods consistently outperform position-only approaches. Interestingly, we discovered that smoothing-based methods can degrade overall performance in complex, congested urban environments, although enforcing monotonicity remains critical. The velocity constrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME) yields optimal results, offering a balance between high accuracy and computational efficiency. Its minimal overhead makes it suitable for both historical analysis and real-time applications, providing significant predictive power when combined with dense datasets.

These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs. LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LeMaterial/LeMat-Traj and https://github.com/LeMaterial/lematerial-fetcher.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Trajectory Prediction via Rule-Regularized Heteroscedastic Deep Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13111v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher.

The investigation of these dynamics can provide a better understanding of diffusing objects and their surrounding media, but a quantitative characterization from individual trajectories is often challenging. Efforts devoted to improving anomalous diffusion detection using classical statistics and machine learning have produced several new methods. Recently, the anomalous diffusion challenge (AnDi, www.andi-challenge.org) was launched to objectively assess these approaches on a common dataset, focusing on three aspects of anomalous diffusion: the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent; the classification of the diffusion model; and the segmentation of trajectories. In this article, I describe a simple approach to tackle the tasks of the AnDi challenge by combining extreme learning machine and feature engineering (AnDi-ELM). The method reaches satisfactory performance while offering a straightforward implementation and fast training time with limited computing resources, making it a suitable tool for fast preliminary screening of anomalous diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Ego-centric Predictive Model Conditioned on Hand Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19852v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In egocentric scenarios, anticipating both the next action and its visual outcome is essential for understanding human-object interactions and for enabling robotic planning. However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly modeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action prediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual scene, while video prediction models generate future frames without conditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or contextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified two-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in egocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we perform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual observations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce causal cross-attention to fuse multi-modal cues, leveraging inferred action signals to guide an image-based Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for frame-by-frame future video generation. Our approach is the first unified model designed to handle both egocentric human activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit predictions of both upcoming actions and their visual consequences. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both action prediction and future video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: github.com/showlab/Ego-PM</p></details> |

To provide an optimized solution, we propose a cooperative trajectory optimization and task allocation framework leveraging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). This study integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for efficient task allocation among multiple UAVs and UGVs, and employs an informed-RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) algorithm for collision-free trajectory generation. Further optimization of task sequencing and path efficiency is conducted using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Simulation experiments conducted in a realistic post-disaster environment demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves the overall efficiency of medical rescue operations compared to traditional strategies. Specifically, our method reduces the total mission completion time to 26.7 minutes for a 15-task scenario, outperforming K-Means clustering and random allocation by over 73%. Furthermore, the framework achieves a substantial 15.1% reduction in total traveled distance after CMA-ES optimization. The cooperative utilization of UAVs and UGVs effectively balances their complementary advantages, highlighting the system's scalability and practicality for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Trust Region Sequential Convex Optimization for Multi-Drone Thermal Screening Trajectory Planning in Urban Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06012v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is essential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas.

To address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k, CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with <1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints, incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled, efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion: Real-Time Trajectory Planning with Just-Enough Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12166v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots equipped with rich sensor suites can localize reliably in partially-observable environments, but powering every sensor continuously is wasteful and often infeasible. Belief-space planners address this by propagating pose-belief covariance through analytic models and switching sensors heuristically--a brittle, runtime-expensive approach. Data-driven approaches--including diffusion models--learn multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, but presuppose an accurate, always-on state estimate. We address the largely open problem: for a given task in a mapped environment, which \textit{minimal sensor subset} must be active at each location to maintain state uncertainty \textit{just low enough} to complete the task? Our key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error. Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion (B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for localisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this single proxy suffices for a soft-actor-critic to choose sensors online, optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth. We deploy B-COD in real-time marine trials on an unmanned surface vehicle and show that it reduces sensing energy consumption while matching the goal-reach performance of an always-on baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025 (Conference on Robot Learning)</p></details> |

The task of predicting pedestrian crossing intention involves determining whether pedestrians in the scene are likely to cross the road or not. In this work, we propose TrajFusionNet, a novel transformer-based model that combines future pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed predictions as priors for predicting crossing intention. TrajFusionNet comprises two branches: a Sequence Attention Module (SAM) and a Visual Attention Module (VAM). The SAM branch learns from a sequential representation of the observed and predicted pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed. Complementarily, the VAM branch enables learning from a visual representation of the predicted pedestrian trajectory by overlaying predicted pedestrian bounding boxes onto scene images. By utilizing a small number of lightweight modalities, TrajFusionNet achieves the lowest total inference time (including model runtime and data preprocessing) among current state-of-the-art approaches. In terms of performance, it achieves state-of-the-art results across the three most commonly used datasets for pedestrian crossing intention prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[GTPO: Trajectory-Based Policy Optimization in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03772v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline (TAP), a scalable and automated method for extracting SDL labels from large trajectory datasets. TAP applies a rules-based cross-entropy optimization approach to learn parameters directly from data, enhancing generalization across diverse driving contexts. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), TAP achieves 30% greater precision than Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 24% over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in identifying behaviorally similar trajectories. Additionally, TAP enables automated detection of unique driving behaviors, streamlining safety evaluation processes for AV testing. This work provides a foundation for scalable scenario-based AV behavior analysis, with potential extensions for integrating multi-agent contexts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Medical doctors guide these conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including annotation guidelines, publicly available at https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |

By segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process. To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change, motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single, single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200 frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space design validation in crowd dynamics research.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as 3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics, STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

However, it is challenging to cooperatively deploy multiple UAV swarms in large-scale remote areas. Hence, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical UAV swarms structure for 6G aerial access networks, where the head UAVs serve as aerial BSs, and tail UAVs (T-UAVs) are responsible for relay. In detail, we jointly optimize the dynamic deployment and trajectory of UAV swarms, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) to concurrently minimize the energy consumption of UAV swarms and GUs, as well as the delay of GUs. However, the proposed MOP is a mixed integer nonlinear programming and NP-hard to solve. Therefore, we develop a K-means and Voronoi diagram based area division method, and construct Fermat points to establish connections between GUs and T-UAVs. Then, an improved non-dominated sorting whale optimization algorithm is proposed to seek Pareto optimal solutions for the transformed MOP. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the performance of proposed algorithms by comparing with baseline mechanisms, resulting in a 50% complexity reduction.</p></details> |  |

Our framework features a unified trajectory representation that encapsulates the kinematic models of both $SO(3)\times\mathbb{R}^3$ and $SE(3)$ pose representations. This encapsulation strategy allows users to use the same implementation of measurement-based factors for either choice of pose representation, which facilitates experimentation and comparison to achieve the best model for the ME task. In addition, unique to our framework, we derive the kinematic models with the closed-form temporal derivatives of the local variable of $SO(3)$ and $SE(3)$, which so far has only been approximated based on the Taylor expansion in the literature. Our experiments show that these kinematic models can improve the estimation accuracy in high-speed scenarios. All analytical Jacobians of the interpolated states with respect to the support states of the trajectory representation, as well as the motion prior factors, are also provided for accelerated Gauss-Newton (GN) optimization. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the framework in various motion estimation tasks such as localization, calibration, and odometry, facilitating fast prototyping for ME researchers.

Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by 32.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website is at: https://denghaoyuan123.github.io/SafeBimanip/</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce the FlexiSteps Network (FSN), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts prediction output time steps based on varying contextual conditions. Inspired by recent advancements addressing observation length discrepancies and dynamic feature extraction, FSN incorporates an pre-trained Adaptive Prediction Module (APM) to evaluate and adjust the output steps dynamically, ensuring optimal prediction accuracy and efficiency. To guarantee the plug-and-play of our FSN, we also design a Dynamic Decoder(DD). Additionally, to balance the prediction time steps and prediction accuracy, we design a scoring mechanism, which not only introduces the Fr\'echet distance to evaluate the geometric similarity between the predicted trajectories and the ground truth trajectories but the length of predicted steps is also considered. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including Argoverse and INTERACTION demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed FSN framework.</p></details> |  |

However, existing works suffer from the generalization problem, \ie, they are either restricted to train for specific regions or only suitable for a few tasks. Given the recent advances of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we raise the question: can MLLMs reform current trajectory data mining and solve the problem? Nevertheless, due to the modality gap of trajectory, how to generate task-independent multimodal trajectory representations and how to adapt flexibly to different tasks remain the foundational challenges. In this paper, we propose \texttt{Traj-MLLM}}, which is the first general framework using MLLMs for trajectory data mining. By integrating multiview contexts, \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} transforms raw trajectories into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving key spatial-temporal characteristics, and directly utilizes the reasoning ability of MLLMs for trajectory analysis. Additionally, a prompt optimization method is proposed to finalize data-invariant prompts for task adaptation. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets show that \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $48.05\%$, $15.52\%$, $51.52\%$, $1.83\%$ on travel time estimation, mobility prediction, anomaly detection and transportation mode identification, respectively. \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} achieves these superior performances without requiring any training data or fine-tuning the MLLM backbones.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |
| **[OmniCache: A Trajectory-Oriented Global Perspective on Training-Free Cache Reuse for Diffusion Transformer Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16212v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure. In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Preference Trajectory Modeling via Flow Matching for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17618v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation predicts each user's next item based on their historical interaction sequence. Recently, diffusion models have attracted significant attention in this area due to their strong ability to model user interest distributions. They typically generate target items by denoising Gaussian noise conditioned on historical interactions. However, these models face two critical limitations. First, they exhibit high sensitivity to the condition, making it difficult to recover target items from pure Gaussian noise. Second, the inference process is computationally expensive, limiting practical deployment. To address these issues, we propose FlowRec, a simple yet effective sequential recommendation framework which leverages flow matching to explicitly model user preference trajectories from current states to future interests. Flow matching is an emerging generative paradigm, which offers greater flexibility in initial distributions and enables more efficient sampling. Based on this, we construct a personalized behavior-based prior distribution to replace Gaussian noise and learn a vector field to model user preference trajectories. To better align flow matching with the recommendation objective, we further design a single-step alignment loss incorporating both positive and negative samples, improving sampling efficiency and generation quality. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the superiority of FlowRec over the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v5)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified.

However, traditional heuristics for branching often fail to generalize across heterogeneous problem instances, while existing learning-based methods such as imitation learning (IL) suffers from dependence on expert demonstration quality, and reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with limitations in sparse rewards and dynamic state representation challenges. To address these issues, we propose ReviBranch, a novel deep RL framework that constructs revived trajectories by reviving explicit historical correspondences between branching decisions and their corresponding graph states along search-tree paths. During training, ReviBranch enables agents to learn from complete structural evolution and temporal dependencies within the branching process. Additionally, we introduce an importance-weighted reward redistribution mechanism that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense stepwise feedback, addressing the sparse reward challenge. Extensive experiments on different MILP benchmarks demonstrate that ReviBranch outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, reducing B&B nodes by 4.0% and LP iterations by 2.2% on large-scale instances. The results highlight the robustness and generalizability of ReviBranch across heterogeneous MILP problem classes.</p></details> | conference |

Natural language enables users to express these adjustments in an interactive manner. We introduce OVITA, an interpretable, open-vocabulary, language-driven framework designed for adapting robot trajectories in dynamic and novel situations based on human instructions. OVITA leverages multiple pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate user commands into trajectories generated by motion planners or those learned through demonstrations. OVITA employs code as an adaptation policy generated by an LLM, enabling users to adjust individual waypoints, thus providing flexible control. Another LLM, which acts as a code explainer, removes the need for expert users, enabling intuitive interactions. The efficacy and significance of the proposed OVITA framework is demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-world environments with diverse tasks involving spatiotemporal variations on heterogeneous robotic platforms such as a KUKA IIWA robot manipulator, Clearpath Jackal ground robot, and CrazyFlie drone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics and Automation Letters 2025.

| **[ExtraGS: Geometric-Aware Trajectory Extrapolation with Uncertainty-Guided Generative Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15529v2)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG) representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF) design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups, and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving high fidelity along the original trajectory.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Rapid Iterative Trajectory Planning Method for Automated Parking through Differential Flatness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17038v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous driving continues to advance, automated parking is becoming increasingly essential. However, significant challenges arise when implementing path velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking. The primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory planning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves maintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory, particularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based rapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above challenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time efficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance framework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned trajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal smoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the proposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path adheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to maintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility of the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time efficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other iteration-based trajectory planning methods. In the real-world experiment, the proposed method was implemented and validated on a ROS-based vehicle, demonstrating the applicability of the RITP method for real vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the journal Robotics and Autonomous Systems</p></details> |
| **[Agentic AI Empowered Multi-UAV Trajectory Optimization in Low-Altitude Economy Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16379v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel Agentic Retrieval-augmented generation with Mamba-Attention Integrated Transformer (ARMAIT) framework for multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) trajectory optimization. The framework is built upon Large Language Models (LLMs), incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowered by Agentic AI and integrated with a UAV-specific knowledge base. Through the Agentic RAG, the LLM autonomously interprets high-level task requirements and identifies the key components necessary for trajectory optimization, including model inputs and outputs, network architecture, reward functions, and task constraints. To support efficient modeling across different system scales, we introduce the Mamba-Attention Integrated Transformer (MAIT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines the long-range dependency modeling capability of attention mechanisms with the efficient temporal dynamic representation of Mamba. Furthermore, a Trajectory-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) method is proposed to achieve unified policy gradient optimization in both discrete and continuous trajectory spaces for MAIT training. Extensive experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ARMAIT framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrated Take-off Management and Trajectory Optimization for Merging Control in Urban Air Mobility Corridors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15395v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has the potential to revolutionize daily transportation, offering rapid and efficient aerial mobility services. Take-off and merging phases are critical for air corridor operations, requiring the coordination of take-off aircraft and corridor traffic while ensuring safety and seamless transition. This paper proposes an integrated take-off management and trajectory optimization for merging control in UAM corridors. We first introduce a novel take-off airspace design. To our knowledge, this paper is one of the first to propose a structured design for take-off airspace. Based on the take-off airspace design, we devise a hierarchical coordinated take-off and merging management (HCTMM) strategy. To be specific, the take-off airspace design can simplify aircraft dynamics and thus reduce the dimensionality of the trajectory optimization problem whilst mitigating obstacle avoidance complexities. The HCTMM strategy strictly ensures safety and improves the efficiency of take-off and merging operations. At the tactical level, a scheduling algorithm coordinates aircraft take-off times and selects dynamic merging points to reduce conflicts and ensure smooth take-off and merging processes. At the operational level, a trajectory optimization strategy ensures that each aircraft reaches the dynamic merging point efficiently while satisfying safety constraints. Simulation results show that, compared to representative strategies with fixed or dynamic merging points, the HCTMM strategy significantly improves operational efficiency and reduces computational burden, while ensuring safety under various corridor traffic conditions. Further results confirm the scalability of the HCTMM strategy and the computational efficiency enabled by the proposed take-off airspace design.</p></details> | 31 pages |
| **[BrainPath: Generating Subject-Specific Brain Aging Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16667v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying and forecasting individual brain aging trajectories is critical for understanding neurodegenerative disease and the heterogeneity of aging, yet current approaches remain limited. Most models predict chronological age, an imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here, we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns. Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Disturbance Rejection Control for Trajectory Tracking of a Seagoing USV: Design, Simulation, and Field Experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21265v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) face significant control challenges due to uncertain environmental disturbances like waves and currents. This paper proposes a trajectory tracking controller based on Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) implemented on the DUS V2500. A custom simulation incorporating realistic waves and current disturbances is developed to validate the controller's performance, supported by further validation through field tests in the harbour of Scheveningen, the Netherlands, and at sea. Simulation results demonstrate that ADRC significantly reduces cross-track error across all tested conditions compared to a baseline PID controller but increases control effort and energy consumption. Field trials confirm these findings while revealing a further increase in energy consumption during sea trials compared to the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at IROS 2025.

| **[TRUST-Planner: Topology-guided Robust Trajectory Planner for AAVs with Uncertain Obstacle Spatial-temporal Avoidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14610v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite extensive developments in motion planning of autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs), existing frameworks faces the challenges of local minima and deadlock in complex dynamic environments, leading to increased collision risks. To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance. In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical information to reduce replanning time. Simulation results show that TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Great GATsBi: Hybrid, Multimodal, Trajectory Forecasting for Bicycles using Anticipation Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14523v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of road user movement is increasingly required by many applications ranging from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous driving, and especially crucial for road safety. Even though most traffic accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention, as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions -- and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlightPatchNet: Multi-Scale Patch Network with Differential Coding for Flight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16200v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multi-step flight trajectory prediction plays an important role in Air Traffic Control, which can ensure the safety of air transportation. Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and most existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by UAI 2025.

| **[Reliability comparison of vessel trajectory prediction models via Probability of Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14198v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This contribution addresses vessel trajectory prediction (VTP), focusing on the evaluation of different deep learning-based approaches. The objective is to assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future inland waterways navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Tracking and Stabilization of Quadrotors Using Deep Koopman Model Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13795v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a data-driven control framework for quadrotor systems that integrates a deep Koopman operator with model predictive control (DK-MPC). The deep Koopman operator is trained on sampled flight data to construct a high-dimensional latent representation in which the nonlinear quadrotor dynamics are approximated by linear models. This linearization enables the application of MPC to efficiently optimize control actions over a finite prediction horizon, ensuring accurate trajectory tracking and stabilization. The proposed DK-MPC approach is validated through a series of trajectory-following and point-stabilization numerical experiments, where it demonstrates superior tracking accuracy and significantly lower computation time compared to conventional nonlinear MPC. These results highlight the potential of Koopman-based learning methods to handle complex quadrotor dynamics while meeting the real-time requirements of embedded flight control. Future work will focus on extending the framework to more agile flight scenarios and improving robustness against external disturbances.</p></details> |  |

We introduce BiND (Bimanual Neural Discriminator-Decoder), a two-stage model that first classifies motion type (unimanual left, unimanual right, or bimanual) and then uses specialized GRU-based decoders, augmented with a trial-relative time index, to predict continuous 2D hand velocities. We benchmark BiND against six state-of-the-art models (SVR, XGBoost, FNN, CNN, Transformer, GRU) on a publicly available 13-session intracortical dataset from a tetraplegic patient. BiND achieves a mean $R^2$ of 0.76 ($\pm$0.01) for unimanual and 0.69 ($\pm$0.03) for bimanual trajectory prediction, surpassing the next-best model (GRU) by 2% in both tasks. It also demonstrates greater robustness to session variability than all other benchmarked models, with accuracy improvements of up to 4% compared to GRU in cross-session analyses. This highlights the effectiveness of task-aware discrimination and temporal modeling in enhancing bimanual decoding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Neural Engineering (NER) Conference'25</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Machine Learning Model with a Constrained Action Space for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03666v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial to advance autonomous driving, improving safety, and efficiency. Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2025 IEEE.

| **[Rapid Urban Visibility Hotspots: Quantifying Building Vertex Visibility from Connected Vehicle Trajectories using Spatial Indexing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03365v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective placement of Out-of-Home advertising and street furniture requires accurate identification of locations offering maximum visual exposure to target audiences, particularly vehicular traffic. Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Tube Visualization of Particle Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13505v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel, computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Survey of Reinforcement Learning for Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08827v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for broader reasoning models. Github: https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/Awesome-RL-for-LRMs</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Hacking: Quantifying the Hidden Risks of Using LLMs for Text Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08825v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting strategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking. We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks from 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models. Analyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure how plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find incorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three hypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small language models. While our findings show that higher task performance and better general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate models do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of findings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking mitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in reducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly, common regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in reducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors. Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is unacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases, anything can be presented as statistically significant.</p></details> |  |
| **[FinZero: Launching Multi-modal Financial Time Series Forecast with Large Reasoning Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08742v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial time series forecasting is both highly significant and challenging. Previous approaches typically standardized time series data before feeding it into forecasting models, but this encoding process inherently leads to a loss of important information. Moreover, past time series models generally require fixed numbers of variables or lookback window lengths, which further limits the scalability of time series forecasting. Besides, the interpretability and the uncertainty in forecasting remain areas requiring further research, as these factors directly impact the reliability and practical value of predictions. To address these issues, we first construct a diverse financial image-text dataset (FVLDB) and develop the Uncertainty-adjusted Group Relative Policy Optimization (UARPO) method to enable the model not only output predictions but also analyze the uncertainty of those predictions. We then proposed FinZero, a multimodal pre-trained model finetuned by UARPO to perform reasoning, prediction, and analytical understanding on the FVLDB financial time series. Extensive experiments validate that FinZero exhibits strong adaptability and scalability. After fine-tuning with UARPO, FinZero achieves an approximate 13.48\% improvement in prediction accuracy over GPT-4o in the high-confidence group, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning fine-tuning in multimodal large model, including in financial time series forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |

Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing is a quality assurance method that has frequently been used for mobile apps. Some GUIs require these text inputs to be able to move from one page to the next. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent text-generation capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, there has not yet been any empirical study to evaluate different pre-trained LLMs' effectiveness at generating text inputs for mobile GUI testing. This paper reports on a large-scale empirical study that extensively investigates the effectiveness of eight state-of-the-art LLMs in Android text-input generation for UI pages. We collected 115 Android apps from Google Play and extracted contextual information from the UI pages to construct prompts for LLMs. The experimental results show that some LLMs can generate more effective and higher-quality text inputs. We conducted an experiment to assess the bug-detection capabilities of LLMs by directly generating invalid text inputs. We also invited professional testers to manually evaluate, modify, and re-create the LLM-generated text inputs. We integrated the text-input generation process into DroidBot to augment its UI-exploration capabilities. Finally, we present several valuable insights regarding the application of LLMs to Android testing, particularly for the generation of text inputs: These insights will benefit the Android testing community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Have Large Vision-Language Models Mastered Art History?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03521v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has established new baselines in image classification across multiple domains. We examine whether their multimodal reasoning can also address a challenge mastered by human experts. Specifically, we test whether VLMs can classify the style, author and creation date of paintings, a domain traditionally mastered by art historians. Artworks pose a unique challenge compared to natural images due to their inherently complex and diverse structures, characterized by variable compositions and styles. This requires a contextual and stylistic interpretation rather than straightforward object recognition. Art historians have long studied the unique aspects of artworks, with style prediction being a crucial component of their discipline. This paper investigates whether large VLMs, which integrate visual and textual data, can effectively reason about the historical and stylistic attributes of paintings. We present the first study of its kind, conducting an in-depth analysis of three VLMs, namely CLIP, LLaVA, and GPT-4o, evaluating their zero-shot classification of art style, author and time period. Using two image benchmarks of artworks, we assess the models' ability to interpret style, evaluate their sensitivity to prompts, and examine failure cases. Additionally, we focus on how these models compare to human art historical expertise by analyzing misclassifications, providing insights into their reasoning and classification patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memorization in Large Language Models in Medicine: Prevalence, Characteristics, and Implications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08604v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis. However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios: (1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain. Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g., regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy, minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.</p></details> |  |
| **[CM-Align: Consistency-based Multilingual Alignment for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08541v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current large language models (LLMs) generally show a significant performance gap in alignment between English and other languages. To bridge this gap, existing research typically leverages the model's responses in English as a reference to select the best/worst responses in other languages, which are then used for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. However, we argue that there are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy multilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not all English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low quality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods usually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference pairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data selection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for improving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes two parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual consistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of constructing high-quality preference data.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |
| **[MESH -- Understanding Videos Like Human: Measuring Hallucinations in Large Video Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08538v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions. Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects in longer videos.</p></details> |  |

Unlike other multimodal models, TerraMind is pretrained on dual-scale representations combining both token-level and pixel-level data across modalities. On a token level, TerraMind encodes high-level contextual information to learn cross-modal relationships, while on a pixel level, TerraMind leverages fine-grained representations to capture critical spatial nuances. We pretrained TerraMind on nine geospatial modalities of a global, large-scale dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that (i) TerraMind's dual-scale early fusion approach unlocks a range of zero-shot and few-shot applications for Earth observation, (ii) TerraMind introduces "Thinking-in-Modalities" (TiM) -- the capability of generating additional artificial data during finetuning and inference to improve the model output -- and (iii) TerraMind achieves beyond state-of-the-art performance in community-standard benchmarks for EO like PANGAEA. The pretraining dataset, the model weights, and our code are open-sourced under a permissive license.</p></details> | Accepted at ICCV'25 |
| **[A Structured Review of Underwater Object Detection Challenges and Solutions: From Traditional to Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08490v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater object detection (UOD) is vital to diverse marine applications, including oceanographic research, underwater robotics, and marine conservation. However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges, computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD, but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further research on optimization techniques.</p></details> | 72 Pages, 11 Figures |

Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be very influenceable by relatively small changes in input and are trained on human-generated data, it is reasonable to assume that they could show a similar tendency. We present a study investigating the presence of acquiescence bias in LLMs across different models, tasks, and languages (English, German, and Polish). Our results indicate that, contrary to humans, LLMs display a bias towards answering no, regardless of whether it indicates agreement or disagreement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

This bias disproportionately preserves high-magnitude values while discarding smaller ones, causing training instability and low model performance. This work introduces Metis, a training framework that combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to efficiently disentangle dominant from long-tail components, compressing broad distributions into quantization-friendly narrow ranges; (ii) adaptive learning rates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and better capture diverse features critical for performance; and (iii) a dual-range regularizer that jointly constrains numerical precision and parameter range distribution, ensuring stable, unbiased low-bit training. With Metis, FP8 training surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy comparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under advanced low-bit quantization. The code implementation for Metis is available at: https://github.com/sii-research/Metis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Convergence using Pre-trained Large Language Models as Tutors With Advice Reusing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08329v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often require long training to become useful, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards. While techniques like reward shaping and curriculum learning exist to accelerate training, these are often extremely specific and require the developer's professionalism and dedicated expertise in the problem's domain. Tackling this challenge, in this study, we explore the effectiveness of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) as tutors in a student-teacher architecture with RL algorithms, hypothesizing that LLM-generated guidance allows for faster convergence. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of reusing the LLM's advice on the RL's convergence dynamics. Through an extensive empirical examination, which included 54 configurations, varying the RL algorithm (DQN, PPO, A2C), LLM tutor (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek), and environment (Blackjack, Snake, Connect Four), our results demonstrate that LLM tutoring significantly accelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance. Furthermore, the advice reuse mechanism shows a further improvement in training duration but also results in less stable convergence dynamics. Our findings suggest that LLM tutoring generally improves convergence, and its effectiveness is sensitive to the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination.</p></details> |  |

Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability, efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online RL methods, e.g. <=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements, with 46.7% and 20.8% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 40 turns and output tokens exceeding 150k during training time. With a simple agent design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 42.1 on xBench and 52.8 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. We open-source our models, training data, and codes in https://github.com/inclusionAI/ASearcher.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Training-free Alignment of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09016v4)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast, training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning, decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (findings), camera-ready version</p></details> |

It is therefore beneficial to develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training instances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks, with RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for RE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a multi-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively capture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second, although employing binary classification for each relation individually can mitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead, resulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training instances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the advantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping, Relation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled texts for RE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[A Systematic Survey on Large Language Models for Evolutionary Optimization: From Modeling to Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08269v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong understanding and reasoning capabilities, are increasingly being explored for tackling optimization problems, especially in synergy with evolutionary computation. Despite rapid progress, however, the field still lacks a unified synthesis and a systematic taxonomy. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of recent developments and organizing them within a structured framework. We classify existing research into two main stages: LLMs for optimization modeling and LLMs for optimization solving. The latter is further divided into three paradigms according to the role of LLMs in the optimization workflow: LLMs as stand-alone optimizers, low-level LLMs embedded within optimization algorithms, and high-level LLMs for algorithm selection and generation. For each category, we analyze representative methods, distill technical challenges, and examine their interplay with traditional approaches. We also review interdisciplinary applications spanning the natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning. By contrasting LLM-driven and conventional methods, we highlight key limitations and research gaps, and point toward future directions for developing self-evolving agentic ecosystems for optimization.

Subspace-based methods using the local approximation strategy are one of the most important methods. This paper discusses different and novel kinds of advanced subspaces for such methods and presents a new algorithm with such subspaces, called MD-LAMBO. Theoretical analysis including the subspaces' properties, sufficient function value decrease, and global convergence is given for the new algorithm. The related model construction on the subspaces is given under derivative-free settings. In numerical results, performance profiles, and truncated Newton step errors of MD-LAMBO using different model-driven subspaces are provided, which show subspace-dependent numerical differences and advantages of our methods and subspaces.</p></details> | 27 pages, 6 figures |

In this paper, we propose the Forgetting-Aware Pruning Metric (FAPM), a novel pruning-based approach to balance CF and downstream task performance. Our investigation reveals that the degree to which task vectors (i.e., the subtraction of pre-trained weights from the weights fine-tuned on downstream tasks) overlap with pre-trained model parameters is a critical factor for CF. Based on this finding, FAPM employs the ratio of the task vector to pre-trained model parameters as a metric to quantify CF, integrating this measure into the pruning criteria. Importantly, FAPM does not necessitate modifications to the training process or model architecture, nor does it require any auxiliary data. We conducted extensive experiments across eight datasets, covering natural language inference, General Q&A, Medical Q&A, Math Q&A, reading comprehension, and cloze tests. The results demonstrate that FAPM limits CF to just 0.25\% while maintaining 99.67\% accuracy on downstream tasks. We provide the code to reproduce our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by emnlp2025</p></details> |

CRITICAL's unique strength lies in capturing full-spectrum patient journeys, including pre-ICU, ICU, and post-ICU encounters across both inpatient and outpatient settings. This multi-institutional, longitudinal perspective creates transformative opportunities for developing generalizable predictive models and advancing health equity research. However, the richness of this multi-site resource introduces substantial complexity in data harmonization, with heterogeneous collection practices and diverse vocabulary usage patterns requiring sophisticated preprocessing approaches. We present CRISP to unlock the full potential of this valuable resource. CRISP systematically transforms raw Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model data into ML-ready datasets through: (1) transparent data quality management with comprehensive audit trails, (2) cross-vocabulary mapping of heterogeneous medical terminologies to unified SNOMED-CT standards, with deduplication and unit standardization, (3) modular architecture with parallel optimization enabling complete dataset processing in $<$1 day even on standard computing hardware, and (4) comprehensive baseline model benchmarks spanning multiple clinical prediction tasks to establish reproducible performance standards. By providing processing pipeline, baseline implementations, and detailed transformation documentation, CRISP saves researchers months of preprocessing effort and democratizes access to large-scale multi-institutional critical care data, enabling them to focus on advancing clinical AI.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[CITER: Collaborative Inference for Efficient Large Language Model Decoding with Token-Level Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01976v6)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have achieved remarkable success in various tasks but suffer from high computational costs during inference, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel Collaborative Inference with Token-lEvel Routing (CITER) framework that enables efficient collaboration between small and large language models (SLMs \& LLMs) through a token-level routing strategy. Specifically, CITER routes non-critical tokens to an SLM for efficiency and routes critical tokens to an LLM for generalization quality. We formulate router training as a policy optimization, where the router receives rewards based on both the quality of predictions and the inference costs of generation. This allows the router to learn to predict token-level routing scores and make routing decisions based on both the current token and the future impact of its decisions. To further accelerate the reward evaluation process, we introduce a shortcut which significantly reduces the costs of the reward estimation and improving the practicality of our approach. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that CITER reduces the inference costs while preserving high-quality generation, offering a promising solution for real-time and resource-constrained applications. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/CITER.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose CoT-RAG, a novel reasoning framework with three key designs: (i) Knowledge Graph-driven CoT Generation, featuring knowledge graphs to modulate reasoning chain generation of LLMs, thereby enhancing reasoning credibility; (ii) Learnable Knowledge Case-aware RAG, which incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into knowledge graphs to retrieve relevant sub-cases and sub-descriptions, providing LLMs with learnable information; (iii) Pseudo Program Prompting Execution, which promotes greater logical rigor by guiding LLMs to execute reasoning tasks as pseudo-programs. Evaluations on nine public datasets spanning three reasoning tasks reveal significant accuracy gains-ranging from 4.0% to 44.3%-over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, tests on four domain-specific datasets demonstrate exceptional accuracy and efficient execution, underscoring its practical applicability and scalability.

Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output control, and dynamic perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. A growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to \textit{10$\times$} acceleration in inference speed. These developments position discrete diffusion models as a promising alternative to intelligence based on the traditional autoregressive approach. In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains and \textit{etc.}. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment. Relative papers are collected in https://github.com/LiQiiiii/Awesome-Discrete-Diffusion-LLM_MLLM</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods, wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate, interpretable, and scalable vision-language applications in remote sensing.

GS typically requires accurate depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes. Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency, inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output, we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdrawn due to an error in the author list & incomplete experimental results</p></details> |

We test o1-mini, o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, and Grok 3 Mini Beta on graph coloring as a variable-complexity constraint-satisfaction logic problem, and find evidence from both error rate comparisons and CoT/explanation text analysis that RLLMs are prone to hallucinate graph edges not specified in the prompt. This phenomenon persists across multiple problem complexity levels and semantic frames, and it appears to account for a significant fraction of the incorrect answers from every tested model, and the vast majority of them for some models. We also validate the generalizability of this input-conflicting hallucination phenomenon with smaller-scale experiments on a type of stable matching problem. Our results indicate that RLLMs may possess broader issues with misrepresentation of problem specifics, and we offer suggestions for design choices to mitigate this weakness.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages (9 excluding references and appendices); 9 figures (6 excluding appendices)</p></details> |
| **[Bias after Prompting: Persistent Discrimination in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08146v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dangerous assumption that can be made from prior work on the bias transfer hypothesis (BTH) is that biases do not transfer from pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to adapted models. We invalidate this assumption by studying the BTH in causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an extremely popular and accessible adaptation strategy used in real-world applications. In contrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and that popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases from transferring. Specifically, the correlation between intrinsic biases and those after prompt adaptation remain moderate to strong across demographics and tasks -- for example, gender (rho >= 0.94) in co-reference resolution, and age (rho >= 0.98) and religion (rho >= 0.69) in question answering. Further, we find that biases remain strongly correlated when varying few-shot composition parameters, such as sample size, stereotypical content, occupational distribution and representational balance (rho >= 0.90). We evaluate several prompt-based debiasing strategies and find that different approaches have distinct strengths, but none consistently reduce bias transfer across models, tasks or demographics. These results demonstrate that correcting bias, and potentially improving reasoning ability, in intrinsic models may prevent propagation of biases to downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCA-LLM: Spectral-Attentive Channel Prediction with Large Language Models in MIMO-OFDM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08139v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the success of large language models (LLMs) has inspired growing interest in exploring their potential applications in wireless communications, especially for channel prediction tasks. However, directly applying LLMs to channel prediction faces a domain mismatch issue stemming from their text-based pre-training. To mitigate this, the ``adapter + LLM" paradigm has emerged, where an adapter is designed to bridge the domain gap between the channel state information (CSI) data and LLMs. While showing initial success, existing adapters may not fully exploit the potential of this paradigm. To address this limitation, this work provides a key insight that learning representations from the spectral components of CSI features can more effectively help bridge the domain gap. Accordingly, we propose a spectral-attentive framework, named SCA-LLM, for channel prediction in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. Specifically, its novel adapter can capture finer spectral details and better adapt the LLM for channel prediction than previous methods. Extensive simulations show that SCA-LLM achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance and strong generalization, yielding up to $-2.4~\text{dB}$ normalized mean squared error (NMSE) advantage over the previous LLM based method. Ablation studies further confirm the superiority of SCA-LLM in mitigating domain mismatch.</p></details> |  |

We present a comprehensive knowledge-enhanced system for PSCs that integrates three key components. First, we develop Perovskite-KG, a domain-specific knowledge graph constructed from 1,517 research papers, containing 23,789 entities and 22,272 relationships. Second, we create two complementary datasets: Perovskite-Chat, comprising 55,101 high-quality question-answer pairs generated through a novel multi-agent framework, and Perovskite-Reasoning, containing 2,217 carefully curated materials science problems. Third, we introduce two specialized large language models: Perovskite-Chat-LLM for domain-specific knowledge assistance and Perovskite-Reasoning-LLM for scientific reasoning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms existing models in both domain-specific knowledge retrieval and scientific reasoning tasks, providing researchers with effective tools for literature review, experimental design, and complex problem-solving in PSC research.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

In this work, inspired by the observation that the text-to-image generation process is the inverse of image-conditioned response generation in LVLMs, we explore the potential of leveraging text-to-image generative models to assist in mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. We discover that generative models can offer valuable self-feedback for mitigating hallucinations at both the response and token levels. Building on this insight, we introduce self-correcting Decoding with Generative Feedback (DeGF), a novel training-free algorithm that incorporates feedback from text-to-image generative models into the decoding process to effectively mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Specifically, DeGF generates an image from the initial response produced by LVLMs, which acts as an auxiliary visual reference and provides self-feedback to verify and correct the initial response through complementary or contrastive decoding. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating diverse types of hallucinations, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods across six benchmarks.

| **[Visual Representation Alignment for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07979v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning. We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/VIRAL/</p></details> |
| **[SAGe: A Lightweight Algorithm-Architecture Co-Design for Mitigating the Data Preparation Bottleneck in Large-Scale Genome Sequence Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03732v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genome sequence analysis, which analyzes the DNA sequences of organisms, drives advances in many critical medical and biotechnological fields. Given its importance and the exponentially growing volumes of genomic sequence data, there are extensive efforts to accelerate genome sequence analysis. In this work, we demonstrate a major bottleneck that greatly limits and diminishes the benefits of state-of-the-art genome sequence analysis accelerators: the data preparation bottleneck, where genomic sequence data is stored in compressed form and needs to be decompressed and formatted first before an accelerator can operate on it. To mitigate this bottleneck, we propose SAGe, an algorithm-architecture co-design for highly-compressed storage and high-performance access of large-scale genomic sequence data. The key challenge is to improve data preparation performance while maintaining high compression ratios (comparable to genomic-specific compression algorithms) at low hardware cost. We address this challenge by leveraging key properties of genomic datasets to co-design (i) a new (de)compression algorithm, (ii) hardware that decompresses data with lightweight operations and efficient streaming accesses, (iii) storage data layout, and (iv) interface commands to access data. SAGe is highly versatile as it supports datasets from different sequencing technologies and species. Thanks to its lightweight design, SAGe can be seamlessly integrated with a broad range of genome sequence analysis hardware accelerators to mitigate their data preparation bottlenecks. Our results demonstrate that SAGe improves the average end-to-end performance and energy efficiency of two state-of-the-art genome sequence analysis accelerators by 3.0x-32.1x and 13.0x-34.0x, respectively, compared to when the accelerators rely on state-of-the-art decompression tools.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often overlook semantic dependencies, relying on token-level probability measures that fail to capture structural relationships within the generated text. We propose GENUINE: Graph ENhanced mUlti-level uncertaINty Estimation for Large Language Models, a structure-aware framework that leverages dependency parse trees and hierarchical graph pooling to refine uncertainty quantification. By incorporating supervised learning, GENUINE effectively models semantic and structural relationships, improving confidence assessments. Extensive experiments across NLP tasks show that GENUINE achieves up to 29% higher AUROC than semantic entropy-based approaches and reduces calibration errors by over 15%, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-based uncertainty modeling.

Greater distributed control and intelligence will allow challenges such as voltage control to be handled effectively. The partitioning of power networks into smaller clusters provides a method to split the control problem into manageable sub-problems. This paper presents a community detection-based partitioning technique for distribution networks considering local DGs, allowing them to be grouped and controlled in a distributed manner by using local signals and measurements. This method also allows each community to control the voltage using only neighboring DGs, and for each community to self-organize to reflect varying DG conditions and to maintain stable control. Simulations demonstrate that the partitioning of the large distribution network is effective, and each community is able to self-organize and to regulate the voltage independently using only its local DGs.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE General Meeting, 5 pages</p></details> |

However, the contribution of the input prompt to the generated content still remains obscure to humans, underscoring the necessity of understanding the causality between input and output pairs. Existing works for providing prompt-specific explanation often confine model output to be classification or next-word prediction. Few initial attempts aiming to explain the entire language generation often treat input prompt texts independently, ignoring their combinatorial effects on the follow-up generation. In this study, we introduce a counterfactual explanation framework based on Joint Prompt Attribution, JoPA, which aims to explain how a few prompt texts collaboratively influences the LLM's complete generation. Particularly, we formulate the task of prompt attribution for generation interpretation as a combinatorial optimization problem, and introduce a probabilistic algorithm to search for the casual input combination in the discrete space. We define and utilize multiple metrics to evaluate the produced explanations, demonstrating both the faithfulness and efficiency of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |
| **[SciGPT: A Large Language Model for Scientific Literature Understanding and Knowledge Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08032v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific literature is growing exponentially, creating a critical bottleneck for researchers to efficiently synthesize knowledge. While general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in text processing, they often fail to capture scientific domain-specific nuances (e.g., technical jargon, methodological rigor) and struggle with complex scientific tasks, limiting their utility for interdisciplinary research. To address these gaps, this paper presents SciGPT, a domain-adapted foundation model for scientific literature understanding and ScienceBench, an open source benchmark tailored to evaluate scientific LLMs. Built on the Qwen3 architecture, SciGPT incorporates three key innovations: (1) low-cost domain distillation via a two-stage pipeline to balance performance and efficiency; (2) a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) attention mechanism that cuts memory consumption by 55\% for 32,000-token long-document reasoning; and (3) knowledge-aware adaptation integrating domain ontologies to bridge interdisciplinary knowledge gaps. Experimental results on ScienceBench show that SciGPT outperforms GPT-4o in core scientific tasks including sequence labeling, generation, and inference. It also exhibits strong robustness in unseen scientific tasks, validating its potential to facilitate AI-augmented scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Humans as Brittle as Large Language Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07869v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The output of large language models (LLM) is unstable, due to both non-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs. This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to instruction changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Adaptation of Large Multimodal Models for Retrieval Augmented Hateful Meme Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13061v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hateful memes have become a significant concern on the Internet, necessitating robust automated detection systems. While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in hateful meme detection, they face notable challenges like sub-optimal performance and limited out-of-domain generalization capabilities. Recent studies further reveal the limitations of both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and in-context learning when applied to LMMs in this setting. To address these issues, we propose a robust adaptation framework for hateful meme detection that enhances in-domain accuracy and cross-domain generalization while preserving the general vision-language capabilities of LMMs. Analysis reveals that our approach achieves improved robustness under adversarial attacks compared to SFT models. Experiments on six meme classification datasets show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger agentic systems. Moreover, our method generates higher-quality rationales for explaining hateful content compared to standard SFT, enhancing model interpretability.

Current frameworks suffer from three critical issues: slow processing that bottlenecks large-scale studies, inconsistent prompting that hurts reproducibility, and narrow task coverage that misses important audio reasoning capabilities. We introduce LALM-Eval, an efficient and comprehensive evaluation framework for LALMs. Our system achieves a speedup of up to 127% over existing toolkits through optimized batch processing and parallel execution, enabling large-scale evaluations previously impractical. We provide standardized prompting protocols and flexible configurations for fair model comparison across diverse scenarios. Additionally, we introduce two new evaluation categories: LLM-Adaptive Diarization for temporal audio understanding and Spoken Language Reasoning for complex audio-based cognitive tasks. Through evaluation across 380+ tasks, we reveal significant gaps in current LALMs, particularly in temporal understanding and complex spoken language reasoning tasks. Our findings also highlight a lack of standardization in instruction modality existent across audio benchmarks, which can lead up performance differences up to 9.5 absolute points on the challenging complex instruction following downstream tasks. LALM-Eval provides both practical evaluation tools and insights into model limitations, advancing systematic LALM development.</p></details> |  |

Although parameter-efficient methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) significantly reduce resource requirements, ensuring the security and verifiability of fine-tuning under zero-knowledge constraints remains an unresolved challenge. To address this, we introduce zkLoRA, the first framework to integrate LoRA fine-tuning with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), achieving provable security and correctness. zkLoRA employs advanced cryptographic techniques -- such as lookup arguments, sumcheck protocols, and polynomial commitments -- to verify both arithmetic and non-arithmetic operations in Transformer-based architectures. The framework provides end-to-end verifiability for forward propagation, backward propagation, and parameter updates during LoRA fine-tuning, while safeguarding the privacy of model parameters and training data. Leveraging GPU-based implementations, zkLoRA demonstrates practicality and efficiency through experimental validation on open-source LLMs like LLaMA, scaling up to 13 billion parameters. By combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning with ZKPs, zkLoRA bridges a critical gap, enabling secure and trustworthy deployment of LLMs in sensitive or untrusted environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small Open Models Achieve Near Parity with Large Models in Low Resource Literary Translation at a Fraction of the Cost](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07829v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex task in machine translation research. However, the translation by small open models remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by introducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for dataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary translations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets (DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for rich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references from the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine tuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to capture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five dimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results show that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with top performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and significantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient translation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open models for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 8 figures, includes datasets and models released on Hugging Face</p></details> |

In this setting, the {\alpha} and z parameters are truly independent from each other. These results also yield an expression for the optimal rate of converting one flat state pair into another.

| **[Point Linguist Model: Segment Any Object via Bridged Large 3D-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07825v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or 3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective. This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and +6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Certainty-Guided Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Dynamic Thinking Budget Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07820v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR) improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive, trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.</p></details> |  |

Previous approaches either relied on fine-tuning LLMs on specific corpora or required manually crafted prompts to evoke specific personalities from LLMs. However, the former is inefficient and costly, while the latter cannot precisely manipulate personality traits at a fine-grained level. To address these challenges, we propose UPLex, a method that uses an Unsupervisedly-Built Personalized Lexicon (UPL) during the decoding phase to manipulate LLM's personality traits. UPL can be constructed from a newly built situational judgment test dataset in an unsupervised fashion, and used to modulate the personality expression of LLMs by dynamically altering their predicted probability of upcoming words in a pluggable fashion. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the remarkable effectiveness and pluggability of our method for fine-grained manipulation of LLMs' personalities.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

Query Expansion (QE) remains a key mechanism for mitigating vocabulary mismatch, but the design space has shifted markedly with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs). This survey synthesizes the field from three angles: (i) a four-dimensional framework of query expansion - from the point of injection (explicit vs. implicit QE), through grounding and interaction (knowledge bases, model-internal capabilities, multi-turn retrieval) and learning alignment, to knowledge graph-based argumentation; (ii) a model-centric taxonomy spanning encoder-only, encoder-decoder, decoder-only, instruction-tuned, and domain/multilingual variants, highlighting their characteristic affordances for QE (contextual disambiguation, controllable generation, zero-/few-shot reasoning); and (iii) practice-oriented guidance on where and how neural QE helps in first-stage retrieval, multi-query fusion, re-ranking, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We compare traditional query expansion with PLM/LLM-based methods across seven key aspects, and we map applications across web search, biomedicine, e-commerce, open-domain QA/RAG, conversational and code search, and cross-lingual settings. The review distills design grounding and interaction, alignment/distillation (SFT/PEFT/DPO), and KG constraints - as robust remedies to topic drift and hallucination. We conclude with an agenda on quality control, cost-aware invocation, domain/temporal adaptation, evaluation beyond end-task metrics, and fairness/privacy. Collectively, these insights provide a principled blueprint for selecting and combining QE techniques under real-world constraints.</p></details> | 38 pages,3 figures |

While existing methods excel at single-document comprehension, they often struggle with cross-document aggregation, particularly when resolving entity-dense questions like "What is the distribution of ACM Fellows among various fields of study?", which require integrating entity-centric insights from heterogeneous sources (e.g., Wikipedia pages). To address this gap, we introduce MEBench, a novel multi-document, multi-entity benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' capacity to retrieve, consolidate, and reason over fragmented information. Our benchmark comprises 4,780 questions which are systematically categorized into three primary categories, further divided into eight distinct types, ensuring broad coverage of real-world multi-entity reasoning scenarios. Our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Llama-3) and RAG pipelines reveal critical limitations: even advanced models achieve only 59% accuracy on MEBench. Our benchmark emphasizes the importance of completeness and factual precision of information extraction in MEQA tasks, using Entity-Attributed F1 (EA-F1) metric for granular evaluation of entity-level correctness and attribution validity. MEBench not only highlights systemic weaknesses in current LLM frameworks but also provides a foundation for advancing robust, entity-aware QA architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Normalization Distortion and the Thermodynamic Formalism of Decoding Strategies for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21929v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in hardware and language model architecture have spurred a revolution in natural language generation. However, autoregressive models compute probability distributions over next-token choices, and sampling from these distributions, known as decoding, has received significantly less attention than other design choices. Existing decoding strategies are largely based on heuristics, resulting in methods that are difficult to apply or improve in a principled manner. We develop the theory of decoding strategies for language models by expressing popular decoding algorithms as equilibrium states in the language of ergodic theory and stating the objective functions they optimize. Using this, we analyze the effect of the local normalization step required to make probabilities sum to one in top-k, nucleus, and temperature sampling. We argue that local normalization distortion is a fundamental defect of decoding strategies and quantify the size of this distortion and its effect on mathematical proxies for the quality and diversity of generated text. This yields conclusions for the design of decoding algorithms and the detection of machine-generated text.</p></details> |  |

An LLM-Driven Large-Scale Study of Refactoring Motivations in Open-Source Projects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07763v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context. Code refactoring improves software quality without changing external behavior. Despite its advantages, its benefits are hindered by the considerable cost of time, resources, and continuous effort it demands. Aim. Understanding why developers refactor, and which metrics capture these motivations, may support wider and more effective use of refactoring in practice. Method. We performed a large-scale empirical study to analyze developers refactoring activity, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify underlying motivations from version control data, comparing our findings with previous motivations reported in the literature. Results. LLMs matched human judgment in 80% of cases, but aligned with literature-based motivations in only 47%. They enriched 22% of motivations with more detailed rationale, often highlighting readability, clarity, and structural improvements. Most motivations were pragmatic, focused on simplification and maintainability. While metrics related to developer experience and code readability ranked highest, their correlation with motivation categories was weak. Conclusions. We conclude that LLMs effectively capture surface-level motivations but struggle with architectural reasoning. Their value lies in providing localized explanations, which, when combined with software metrics, can form hybrid approaches. Such integration offers a promising path toward prioritizing refactoring more systematically and balancing short-term improvements with long-term architectural goals.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the following contributions. First, we present a large-scale automatic annotation method that aggregates frame-level captions grounded with bounding boxes into temporally dense and consistent annotations. We apply this approach on the HowTo100M dataset to construct a large-scale pre-training dataset, named HowToGround1M. We also introduce a Grounded Video Caption Generation model, dubbed GROVE, and pre-train the model on HowToGround1M. Second, we introduce iGround--a dataset of 3513 videos with manually annotated captions and dense spatio-temporally grounded bounding boxes. This allows us to measure progress on this challenging problem, as well as to fine-tune our model on this small-scale but high-quality data. Third, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the proposed iGround dataset, as well as on the VidSTG, ActivityNet-Entities, GroundingYouTube, and YouCook-Interactions datasets. Our ablations demonstrate the importance of pre-training on our automatically annotated HowToGround1M dataset followed by fine-tuning on the manually annotated iGround dataset and validate the key technical contributions of our model.

However, they can generate off-topic, discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract) theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption.

Our comprehensive approach systematically integrates pre-ranking models (BM25, BERT, monoT5), embedding-based semantic representations (BGE-m3, LLM2Vec), and advanced Large Language Models (Qwen-2, QwQ-32B, DeepSeek-V3) for summarization, relevance scoring, and contextual re-ranking. Specifically, in Task 2, our two-stage retrieval system combined lexical-semantic filtering with contextualized LLM analysis, achieving first place with an F1 score of 0.3195. Additionally, in other tasks--including Legal Case Retrieval, Statute Law Retrieval, Legal Textual Entailment, and Legal Judgment Prediction--we demonstrated robust performance through carefully engineered ensembles and effective prompt-based reasoning strategies. Our findings highlight the potential of hybrid models integrating traditional IR techniques with contemporary generative models, providing a valuable reference for future advancements in legal information processing.</p></details> |  |

On the one hand, traditional CTR prediction models capture the collaborative signals in tabular data via feature interaction modeling, but they lose semantics in text. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in understanding the context and meaning behind text, but they face challenges in capturing collaborative signals and they have long inference latency. In this paper, we aim to leverage the benefits of both types of models and pursue collaboration, semantics and efficiency. We present ELEC, which is an Efficient LLM-Empowered CTR prediction framework. We first adapt an LLM for the CTR prediction task. In order to leverage the ability of the LLM but simultaneously keep efficiency, we utilize the pseudo-siamese network which contains a gain network and a vanilla network. We inject the high-level representation vector generated by the LLM into a collaborative CTR model to form the gain network such that it can take advantage of both tabular modeling and textual modeling. However, its reliance on the LLM limits its efficiency. We then distill the knowledge from the gain network to the vanilla network on both the score level and the representation level, such that the vanilla network takes only tabular data as input, but can still generate comparable performance as the gain network. Our approach is model-agnostic. It allows for the integration with various existing LLMs and collaborative CTR models. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ELEC for CTR prediction.</p></details> | SIGIR 2025 |

While most of the existing approaches focus solely on textual data, real-world social media content increasingly combines text with visual elements creating a need for advanced multimodal methods. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal stance detection framework that integrates textual and visual information through a hierarchical fusion approach. Our method first employs a Large Language Model to retrieve stance-relevant summaries from source text, while a domain-aware image caption generator interprets visual content in the context of the target topic. These modalities are then jointly modeled along with the reply text, through a specialized transformer module that captures interactions between the texts and images. The proposed modality fusion framework integrates diverse modalities to facilitate robust stance classification. We evaluate our approach on the MultiClimate dataset, a benchmark for climate change-related stance detection containing aligned video frames and transcripts. We achieve accuracy of 76.2%, precision of 76.3%, recall of 76.2% and F1-score of 76.2%, respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[PanoLAM: Large Avatar Model for Gaussian Full-Head Synthesis from One-shot Unposed Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07552v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass. This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data. For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework towards existing work.</p></details> |  |

| **[MVPBench: A Benchmark and Fine-Tuning Framework for Aligning Large Language Models with Diverse Human Values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08022v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical for their safe and effective deployment across diverse user populations. However, existing benchmarks often neglect cultural and demographic diversity, leading to limited understanding of how value alignment generalizes globally. In this work, we introduce MVPBench, a novel benchmark that systematically evaluates LLMs' alignment with multi-dimensional human value preferences across 75 countries. MVPBench contains 24,020 high-quality instances annotated with fine-grained value labels, personalized questions, and rich demographic metadata, making it the most comprehensive resource of its kind to date. Using MVPBench, we conduct an in-depth analysis of several state-of-the-art LLMs, revealing substantial disparities in alignment performance across geographic and demographic lines. We further demonstrate that lightweight fine-tuning methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), can significantly enhance value alignment in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Our findings underscore the necessity for population-aware alignment evaluation and provide actionable insights for building culturally adaptive and value-sensitive LLMs. MVPBench serves as a practical foundation for future research on global alignment, personalized value modeling, and equitable AI development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-view-guided Passage Reranking with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07485v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in passage reranking tasks. Despite their success, LLM-based methods still face challenges in efficiency and sensitivity to external biases. (1) Existing models rely mostly on autoregressive generation and sliding window strategies to rank passages, which incur heavy computational overhead as the number of passages increases. (2) External biases, such as position or selection bias, hinder the model's ability to accurately represent passages and increase input-order sensitivity. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel passage reranking model, called Multi-View-guided Passage Reranking (MVP). MVP is a non-generative LLM-based reranking method that encodes query-passage information into diverse view embeddings without being influenced by external biases. For each view, it combines query-aware passage embeddings to produce a distinct anchor vector, which is then used to directly compute relevance scores in a single decoding step. In addition, it employs an orthogonal loss to make the views more distinctive. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP, with just 220M parameters, matches the performance of much larger 7B-scale fine-tuned models while achieving a 100x reduction in inference latency. Notably, the 3B-parameter variant of MVP achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

However, large-scale datasets used for policy training often introduce substantial variability in quality, which can negatively impact performance. As a result, automatically curating datasets by filtering low-quality samples to improve quality becomes essential. Existing robotic curation approaches rely on costly manual annotations and perform curation at a coarse granularity, such as the dataset or trajectory level, failing to account for the quality of individual state-action pairs. To address this, we introduce SCIZOR, a self-supervised data curation framework that filters out low-quality state-action pairs to improve the performance of imitation learning policies. SCIZOR targets two complementary sources of low-quality data: suboptimal data, which hinders learning with undesirable actions, and redundant data, which dilutes training with repetitive patterns. SCIZOR leverages a self-supervised task progress predictor for suboptimal data to remove samples lacking task progression, and a deduplication module operating on joint state-action representation for samples with redundant patterns. Empirically, we show that SCIZOR enables imitation learning policies to achieve higher performance with less data, yielding an average improvement of 15.4% across multiple benchmarks.

In contrast, autonomous vehicles lack these abilities, making it challenging to manage perception-related Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) risks, especially under complex or unpredictable driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on a customized dataset specifically designed to capture perception-related SOTIF scenarios. Benchmarking results show that fine-tuned MLLMs achieve an 11.8\% improvement in close-ended VQA accuracy and a 12.0\% increase in open-ended VQA scores compared to baseline models, while maintaining real-time performance with a 0.59-second average inference time per image. We validate our approach through real-world case studies in Canada and China, where fine-tuned models correctly identify safety risks that challenge even experienced human drivers. This work represents the first application of domain-specific MLLM fine-tuning for SOTIF domain in autonomous driving.

In this work, we present a novel approach by fine-tuning Meta's Llama3 Large Language Models (LLMs) to create SynLlama, which generates full synthetic pathways made of commonly accessible building blocks and robust organic reaction templates. SynLlama explores a large synthesizable space using significantly less data, and offers strong performance in both forward and bottom-up synthesis planning compared to other state-of-the-art methods. We find that SynLlama, even without training on external building blocks, can effectively generalize to unseen yet purchasable building blocks, meaning that its reconstruction capabilities extend to a broader synthesizable chemical space than the training data. We also demonstrate the use of SynLlama in a pharmaceutical context for synthesis planning of analog molecules and hit expansion leads for proposed inhibitors of target proteins, offering medicinal chemists a valuable tool for discovery.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks tend to overlook certain aspects of EI in long-context scenarios, especially under realistic, practical settings where interactions are lengthy, diverse, and often noisy. To move towards such realistic settings, we present LongEmotion, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context EI tasks. It covers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion Detection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion Expression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens, with long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance performance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them with standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG method leverages both the conversation context and the large language model itself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The CoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five stages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge injection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs toward more practical and real-world EI applications. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative case study experiment on the GPT series to demonstrate the differences among various models in terms of EI.

To address this, we propose \textbf{OBLIVIATE}, a robust unlearning framework that removes targeted data while preserving model utility. The framework follows a structured process: extracting target tokens, building retain sets, and fine-tuning with a tailored loss function comprising three components -- masking, distillation, and world fact. Using low-rank adapters (LoRA) ensures efficiency without compromising unlearning quality. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets, including Harry Potter series, WMDP, and TOFU, using a comprehensive suite of metrics: \emph{forget quality} (via a new document-level memorization score), \emph{model utility}, and \emph{fluency}. Results demonstrate its effectiveness in resisting membership inference attacks, minimizing the impact on retained data, and maintaining robustness across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at EMNLP 25 main conference</p></details> |

However, a fundamental question remains: Can LLMs effectively utilize causal knowledge for prediction and generation? Through empirical studies, we find that LLMs trained directly on large-scale data often capture spurious correlations rather than true causal relationships, leading to suboptimal performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), a novel approach that injects fine-grained causal knowledge into the attention mechanism. We propose an automated pipeline that leverages human priors to automatically generate token-level causal signals and introduce the Re-Attention mechanism to guide training, helping the model focus on causal structures while mitigating noise and biases in attention scores. Experimental results on our proposed Spurious Token Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our approach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains robust in OOD scenarios. The CAT achieves an average improvement of 5.76% on the STG dataset and 1.56% on downstream tasks. Notably, the OOD performance of the Llama-3.1-8B model on STG_M increased from 64.5% to 90.5%, and Qwen's OOD performance on the STG_H dataset improved from 25.4% to 55.9%.

Effective methods for addressing this problem, including PCGrad, CAGrad, and GradNorm, in their original implementations are computationally demanding, which significantly limits their application in modern large models and transformers. We propose Gradient Conductor (GCond), a method that builds upon PCGrad principles by combining them with gradient accumulation and an adaptive arbitration mechanism. We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K dataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed method against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient conflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated superior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM losses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high scalability, being successfully applied to both compact models (MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base). It also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and Lion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the problem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Topic modeling is essential for organizing and retrieving scholarly content in digital library systems, helping users navigate complex and evolving knowledge domains. However, widely used automated metrics, such as coherence and diversity, often capture only narrow statistical patterns and fail to explain semantic failures in practice. We introduce a purpose-oriented evaluation framework that employs nine LLM-based metrics spanning four key dimensions of topic quality: lexical validity, intra-topic semantic soundness, inter-topic structural soundness, and document-topic alignment soundness. The framework is validated through adversarial and sampling-based protocols, and is applied across datasets spanning news articles, scholarly publications, and social media posts, as well as multiple topic modeling methods and open-source LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLM-based metrics provide interpretable, robust, and task-relevant assessments, uncovering critical weaknesses in topic models such as redundancy and semantic drift, which are often missed by traditional metrics. These results support the development of scalable, fine-grained evaluation tools for maintaining topic relevance in dynamic datasets.

World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a $90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

We present a Bayesian framework to disentangle and quantify three such biases: (i) a topic bias toward prior opinions in the training data; (ii) an agreement bias favoring agreement irrespective of the question; and (iii) an anchoring bias toward the initiating agent's stance. Applying this framework to multi-step dialogues reveals that opinion trajectories tend to quickly converge to a shared attractor, with the influence of the interaction fading over time, and the impact of biases differing between LLMs. In addition, we fine-tune an LLM on different sets of strongly opinionated statements (incl. misinformation) and demonstrate that the opinion attractor shifts correspondingly. Exposing stark differences between LLMs and providing quantitative tools to compare them to human subjects in the future, our approach highlights both chances and pitfalls in using LLMs as proxies for human behavior.</p></details> |  |

However, ensuring their trustworthiness remains a critical challenge, as reliability is essential not only for accurate performance but also for upholding ethical, cultural, and social values. Careful alignment of training data and culturally grounded evaluation criteria are vital for developing responsible AI systems. In this study, we introduce the EPT (Evaluation of Persian Trustworthiness) metric, a culturally informed benchmark specifically designed to assess the trustworthiness of LLMs across six key aspects: truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and ethical alignment. We curated a labeled dataset and evaluated the performance of several leading models - including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen - using both automated LLM-based and human assessments. Our results reveal significant deficiencies in the safety dimension, underscoring the urgent need for focused attention on this critical aspect of model behavior. Furthermore, our findings offer valuable insights into the alignment of these models with Persian ethical-cultural values and highlight critical gaps and opportunities for advancing trustworthy and culturally responsible AI.

Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965 resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias, generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting accountability and fairness in AI development.</p></details> |  |

To promote transparency and encourage further research, this framework has been made publicly available as an open-source tool. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs, providing a foundational assessment of their trade-offs in reliability, operational efficiency, and model calibration. Our results quantify a clear performance hierarchy, identifying top models that exhibit high alignment with a benchmark standard and trustworthy, well-calibrated confidence scores. We also demonstrate that classification performance is highly dependent on the task's semantic ambiguity, with all models showing higher consensus on objective component identification than on interpretive maintenance actions. Given that no model achieves perfect accuracy and that calibration varies dramatically, we conclude that the most effective and responsible near-term application is a Human-in-the-Loop system, where LLMs act as a powerful assistant to accelerate and standardise data labelling for human experts, thereby enhancing O&M data quality and downstream reliability analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Assoc...</summary><p>Associated GitHub repository: https://github.com/mvmalyi/wind-farm-maintenance-logs-labelling-with-llms</p></details> |
| **[Error Classification of Large Language Models on Math Word Problems: A Dynamically Adaptive Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15581v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains. Math Word Problems (MWPs) serve as a crucial benchmark for evaluating LLMs' reasoning abilities. While most research primarily focuses on improving accuracy, it often neglects understanding and addressing the underlying patterns of errors. Current error classification methods rely on static and predefined categories, which limit their ability to capture the full spectrum of error patterns in mathematical reasoning. To enable systematic error analysis, we collect error samples from 15 different LLMs of varying sizes across four distinct MWP datasets using multiple sampling strategies. Based on this extensive collection, we introduce MWPES-300K, a comprehensive dataset containing 304,865 error samples that cover diverse error patterns and reasoning paths. To reduce human bias and enable fine-grained analysis of error patterns, we propose a novel framework for automated dynamic error classification in mathematical reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that dataset characteristics significantly shape error patterns, which evolve from basic to complex manifestations as model capabilities increase. With deeper insights into error patterns, we propose Error-Aware Prompting (EAP) that incorporates common error patterns as explicit guidance, leading to significant improvements in mathematical reasoning performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 10 figures, accepted by Findings of EMNLP2025</p></details> |

While most research focuses on short-term scenarios with minimal appearance changes, real-world applications demand robust systems that handle long-term variations caused by clothing and physical changes. We present CHIRLA, Comprehensive High-resolution Identification and Re-identification for Large-scale Analysis, a novel dataset designed for video-based long-term person Re-ID. CHIRLA was recorded over seven months in four connected indoor environments using seven strategically placed cameras, capturing realistic movements with substantial clothing and appearance variability. The dataset includes 22 individuals, more than five hours of video, and about 1M bounding boxes with identity annotations obtained through semi-automatic labeling. We also define benchmark protocols for person tracking and Re-ID, covering diverse and challenging scenarios such as occlusion, reappearance, and multi-camera conditions. By introducing this comprehensive benchmark, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of Re-ID algorithms that can reliably perform in challenging, long-term real-world scenarios. The benchmark code is publicly available at: https://github.com/bdager/CHIRLA.</p></details> |  |

While large-scale pretraining has driven substantial progress, fine-tuning these models for aligning with human values or engaging in specific tasks or behaviors remains a critical challenge. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offer promising frameworks for this aligning process. While DRL enables models to optimize actions using reward signals instead of relying solely on supervised preference data, DPO directly aligns the policy with preferences, eliminating the need for an explicit reward model. This overview explores paradigms for fine-tuning LVLMs, highlighting how DRL and DPO techniques can be used to align models with human preferences and values, improve task performance, and enable adaptive multimodal interaction. We categorize key approaches, examine sources of preference data, reward signals, and discuss open challenges such as scalability, sample efficiency, continual learning, generalization, and safety. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of how DRL and DPO contribute to the evolution of robust and human-aligned LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Algorithms, Computing and Artificial Intelligence (ACAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[ALPS: Improved Optimization for Highly Sparse One-Shot Pruning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07831v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impressive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various natural language processing tasks comes at the cost of vast computational resources and storage requirements. One-shot pruning techniques offer a way to alleviate these burdens by removing redundant weights without the need for retraining. Yet, the massive scale of LLMs often forces current pruning approaches to rely on heuristics instead of optimization-based techniques, potentially resulting in suboptimal compression. In this paper, we introduce ALPS, an optimization-based framework that tackles the pruning problem using the operator splitting technique and a preconditioned conjugate gradient-based post-processing step. Our approach incorporates novel techniques to accelerate and theoretically guarantee convergence while leveraging vectorization and GPU parallelism for efficiency. ALPS substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of the pruning objective and perplexity reduction, particularly for highly sparse models. On the OPT-30B model with 70% sparsity, ALPS achieves a 13% reduction in test perplexity on the WikiText dataset and a 19% improvement in zero-shot benchmark performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[SUDER: Self-Improving Unified Large Multimodal Models for Understanding and Generation with Dual Self-Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07963v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building upon large language models (LLMs), recent large multimodal models (LMMs) unify cross-model understanding and generation into a single framework. However, LMMs still struggle to achieve accurate vision-language alignment, prone to generating text responses contradicting the visual input or failing to follow the text-to-image prompts. Current solutions require external supervision (e.g., human feedback or reward models) and only address unidirectional tasks-either understanding or generation. In this work, based on the observation that understanding and generation are naturally inverse dual tasks, we propose \textbf{SUDER} (\textbf{S}elf-improving \textbf{U}nified LMMs with \textbf{D}ual s\textbf{E}lf-\textbf{R}ewards), a framework reinforcing the understanding and generation capabilities of LMMs with a self-supervised dual reward mechanism. SUDER leverages the inherent duality between understanding and generation tasks to provide self-supervised optimization signals for each other. Specifically, we sample multiple outputs for a given input in one task domain, then reverse the input-output pairs to compute the dual likelihood within the model as self-rewards for optimization. Extensive experimental results on visual understanding and generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance the performance of the model without any external supervision, especially achieving remarkable improvements in text-to-image tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models for Accurate Sign Language Translation in Low-Resource Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18183v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating natural languages into sign languages is a highly complex and underexplored task. Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity, the development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited availability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign language data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these data-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically domain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic richness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use of LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample selection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities in processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore, they are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this limitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural language and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both English and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the field, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset. We demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AulSign, with the potential to enhance accessibility and inclusivity in communication technologies for underrepresented linguistic communities.</p></details> |  |

This work addresses the critical bottleneck hindering AI's progression toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)--the disconnect between language models and "world models"--as well as the fundamental limitations of Transformer-based architectures rooted in the conventional representation learning paradigm. BriLLM incorporates two pivotal neurocognitive principles: (1) static semantic mapping, where tokens are mapped to specialized nodes analogous to cortical areas, and (2) dynamic signal propagation, which simulates electrophysiological information dynamics observed in brain activity. This architecture enables multiple transformative breakthroughs: natural multi-modal compatibility, full model interpretability at the node level, context-length independent scaling, and the first global-scale simulation of brain-like information processing for language tasks. Our initial 1-2B parameter models successfully replicate GPT-1-level generative capabilities while demonstrating stable perplexity reduction. Scalability analyses confirm the feasibility of 100-200B parameter variants capable of processing 40,000-token vocabularies. The paradigm is reinforced by both Occam's Razor--evidenced in the simplicity of direct semantic mapping--and natural evolution--given the brain's empirically validated AGI architecture. BriLLM establishes a novel, biologically grounded framework for AGI advancement that addresses fundamental limitations of current approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, little is known about how the vast number of music listeners across the globe have listened to and perceived K-pop. This study addresses this question by analyzing a large-scale listening dataset from Last.fm. An analysis of the distribution of play counts reveals that K-pop experienced a significant increase in plays between 2005 and 2019, largely supported by a small group of heavy listeners. The Gini coefficient in play counts is notably greater than that of existing mainstream genres and other growing niche genres. Furthermore, an analysis based on user-assigned genre tags quantitatively demonstrates that between 2005 and 2010, K-pop shed its status as a local Asian genre and established itself as a distinct music genre in its own right.</p></details> |  |

However, reliable interaction typically requires a 3D scene representation that is metric-scaled and aligned with the robot reference frame. This depends on accurate camera-to-robot calibration and dense 3D reconstruction, tasks usually treated separately, despite both relying on geometric correspondences from RGB data. Traditional calibration needs patterns, while RGB-based reconstruction yields geometry with an unknown scale in an arbitrary frame. Multi-camera setups add further complexity, as data must be expressed in a shared reference frame. We present Calib3R, a patternless method that jointly performs camera-to-robot calibration and metric-scaled 3D reconstruction via unified optimization. Calib3R handles single- and multi-camera setups on robot arms or mobile robots. It builds on the 3D foundation model MASt3R to extract pointmaps from RGB images, which are combined with robot poses to reconstruct a scaled 3D scene aligned with the robot. Experiments on diverse datasets show that Calib3R achieves accurate calibration with less than 10 images, outperforming target-less and marker-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRAM-R$^2$: Self-Training Generative Foundation Reward Models for Reward Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02492v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant progress in reward modeling over recent years has been driven by a paradigm shift from task-specific designs towards generalist reward models. Despite this trend, developing effective reward models remains a fundamental challenge: the heavy reliance on large-scale labeled preference data. Pre-training on abundant unlabeled data offers a promising direction, but existing approaches fall short of instilling explicit reasoning into reward models. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-training approach that leverages unlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning in reward models. Based on this approach, we develop GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model trained to produce not only preference labels but also accompanying reward rationales. GRAM-R$^2$ can serve as a foundation model for reward reasoning and can be applied to a wide range of tasks with minimal or no additional fine-tuning. It can support downstream applications such as response ranking and task-specific reward tuning. Experiments on response ranking, task adaptation, and reinforcement learning from human feedback demonstrate that GRAM-R$^2$ consistently delivers strong performance, outperforming several strong discriminative and generative baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Compositional Reasoning in Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06037v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance across a wide range of domains. However, a question remains: Do TSFMs succeed by memorizing patterns in training data, or do they possess the ability to reason about such patterns? While reasoning is a topic of great interest in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is undefined and largely unexplored in the context of TSFMs. In this work, inspired by language modeling literature, we formally define compositional reasoning in forecasting and distinguish it from in-distribution generalization. We evaluate the reasoning and generalization capabilities of 16 popular deep learning forecasting models on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, through controlled studies, we systematically examine which design choices in 7 popular open-source TSFMs contribute to improved reasoning capabilities. Our study yields key insights into the impact of TSFM architecture design on compositional reasoning and generalization. We find that patch-based Transformers have the best reasoning performance, closely followed by residualized MLP-based architectures, which are 97\% less computationally complex in terms of FLOPs and 86\% smaller in terms of the number of trainable parameters. Interestingly, in some zero-shot out-of-distribution scenarios, these models can outperform moving average and exponential smoothing statistical baselines trained on in-distribution data. Only a few design choices, such as the tokenization method, had a significant (negative) impact on Transformer model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two Sides of the Same Optimization Coin: Model Degradation and Representation Collapse in Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08401v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models, inspired by the success of LLMs, are designed to learn the optimal embedding from multi-domain TAGs for the downstream cross-task generalization capability. During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs; Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) - (1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale. Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Recently, research has focused on Federated Source-Free Domain Adaptation (FFREEDA), a more realistic scenario wherein client-held target domain data remains unlabeled, and the server can access source domain data only during pre-training. We extend this framework to a more complex and realistic setting: Class Imbalanced FFREEDA (CI-FFREEDA), which takes into account class imbalances in both the source and target domains, as well as label shifts between source and target and among target clients. The replication of existing methods in our experimental setup lead us to rethink the focus from enhancing aggregation and domain adaptation methods to improving the feature extractors within the network itself. We propose replacing the FFREEDA backbone with a frozen vision foundation model (VFM), thereby improving overall accuracy without extensive parameter tuning and reducing computational and communication costs in federated learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that VFMs effectively mitigate the effects of domain gaps, class imbalances, and even non-IID-ness among target clients, suggesting that strong feature extractors, not complex adaptation or FL methods, are key to success in the real-world FL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the IEEE ICIP 2025 Satellite Workshop 1: Edge Intelligence: Smart, Efficient, and Scalable Solutions for IoT, Wearables, and Embedded Devices (SEEDS)</p></details> |

To better track and address this challenge, detailed and reliable mapping is needed to support sustainability efforts and emerging regulatory frameworks. We present an open-access geospatial dataset of oil palm plantations and related land cover types in Indonesia, produced through expert labeling of high-resolution satellite imagery from 2020 to 2024. The dataset provides polygon-based, wall-to-wall annotations across a range of agro-ecological zones and includes a hierarchical typology that distinguishes oil palm planting stages as well as similar perennial crops. Quality was ensured through multi-interpreter consensus and field validation. The dataset was created using wall-to-wall digitization over large grids, making it suitable for training and benchmarking both conventional convolutional neural networks and newer geospatial foundation models. Released under a CC-BY license, it fills a key gap in training data for remote sensing and aims to improve the accuracy of land cover types mapping. By supporting transparent monitoring of oil palm expansion, the resource contributes to global deforestation reduction goals and follows FAIR data principles.</p></details> |  |

This survey examines how these models address critical challenges in autonomous perception, including limitations in generalization, scalability, and robustness to distributional shifts. The survey introduces a novel taxonomy structured around four essential capabilities for robust performance in dynamic driving environments: generalized knowledge, spatial understanding, multi-sensor robustness, and temporal reasoning. For each capability, the survey elucidates its significance and comprehensively reviews cutting-edge approaches. Diverging from traditional method-centric surveys, our unique framework prioritizes conceptual design principles, providing a capability-driven guide for model development and clearer insights into foundational aspects. We conclude by discussing key challenges, particularly those associated with the integration of these capabilities into real-time, scalable systems, and broader deployment challenges related to computational demands and ensuring model reliability against issues like hallucinations and out-of-distribution failures. The survey also outlines crucial future research directions to enable the safe and effective deployment of foundation models in autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 14 figures, accepted at IEEE Open Journal of Vehicular Technology (OJVT)</p></details> |

This drives the need for robust fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based, representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment in real-world educational settings is hindered by privacy regulations, data silos, and limited domain-specific data availability. We introduce M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) for education: a paradigm that integrates federated learning (FL) with M3T FMs to enable collaborative, privacy-preserving training across decentralized institutions while accommodating diverse modalities and tasks. Subsequently, this position paper aims to unveil M3T FedFMs as a promising yet underexplored approach to the education community, explore its potentials, and reveal its related future research directions. We outline how M3T FedFMs can advance three critical pillars of next-generation intelligent education systems: (i) privacy preservation, by keeping sensitive multi-modal student and institutional data local; (ii) personalization, through modular architectures enabling tailored models for students, instructors, and institutions; and (iii) equity and inclusivity, by facilitating participation from underrepresented and resource-constrained entities. We finally identify various open research challenges, including studying of (i) inter-institution heterogeneous privacy regulations, (ii) the non-uniformity of data modalities' characteristics, (iii) the unlearning approaches for M3T FedFMs, (iv) the continual learning frameworks for M3T FedFMs, and (v) M3T FedFM model interpretability, which must be collectively addressed for practical deployment.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

| **[General Demographic Foundation Models for Enhancing Predictive Performance Across Diseases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07330v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often relegated to auxiliary roles in model design, with limited attention has been given to learning their representations. This study proposes a General Demographic Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational representation framework tailored to age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with diverse diseases and population compositions from different geographic regions. The GDP architecture explores combinations of ordering strategies and encoding methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into latent embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that sequential ordering substantially improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification. Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundational models for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and populations, offering a promising direction for improving predictive performance in healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |

Here we introduce AlphaEarth Foundations, an embedding field model yielding a highly general, geospatial representation that assimilates spatial, temporal, and measurement contexts across multiple sources, enabling accurate and efficient production of maps and monitoring systems from local to global scales. The embeddings generated by AlphaEarth Foundations are the only to consistently outperform a suite of other well-known/widely accepted featurization approaches tested on a diverse set of mapping evaluations without re-training.

| **[Of Graphs and Tables: Zero-Shot Node Classification with Tabular Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07143v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast, tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns, enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders, applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for scalable and generalizable graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Trained on a diverse set of datasets of initial and boundary conditions paired with corresponding solutions to ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs), ICON learns to map example condition-solution pairs of a given differential equation to an approximation of its solution operator. Here, we present a probabilistic framework that reveals ICON as implicitly performing Bayesian inference, where it computes the mean of the posterior predictive distribution over solution operators conditioned on the provided context, i.e., example condition-solution pairs. The formalism of random differential equations provides the probabilistic framework for describing the tasks ICON accomplishes while also providing a basis for understanding other multi-operator learning methods. This probabilistic perspective provides a basis for extending ICON to \emph{generative} settings, where one can sample from the posterior predictive distribution of solution operators. The generative formulation of ICON (GenICON) captures the underlying uncertainty in the solution operator, which enables principled uncertainty quantification in the solution predictions in operator learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5 million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites, spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with cross-species and cross-task capabilities.

| **[Leveraging Generic Foundation Models for Multimodal Surgical Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06831v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal setup. In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition. As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings. Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures; accepted at ML-CDS @ MICCAI 2025, Daejeon, Republic of Korea</p></details> |

This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models (FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing 150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging. Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Foundations for Deep Research Systems: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06733v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator, and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback. Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent, off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration, recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence on such human priors and rater biases. This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations of deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii) agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA, VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, first version</p></details> |
| **[MM-DINOv2: Adapting Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06617v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models like DINOv2 demonstrate remarkable potential in medical imaging despite their origin in natural image domains. However, their design inherently works best for uni-modal image analysis, limiting their effectiveness for multi-modal imaging tasks that are common in many medical fields, such as neurology and oncology. While supervised models perform well in this setting, they fail to leverage unlabeled datasets and struggle with missing modalities, a frequent challenge in clinical settings. To bridge these gaps, we introduce MM-DINOv2, a novel and efficient framework that adapts the pre-trained vision foundation model DINOv2 for multi-modal medical imaging. Our approach incorporates multi-modal patch embeddings, enabling vision foundation models to effectively process multi-modal imaging data. To address missing modalities, we employ full-modality masking, which encourages the model to learn robust cross-modality relationships. Furthermore, we leverage semi-supervised learning to harness large unlabeled datasets, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of medical predictions. Applied to glioma subtype classification from multi-sequence brain MRI, our method achieves a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.6 on an external test set, surpassing state-of-the-art supervised approaches by +11.1%. Our work establishes a scalable and robust solution for multi-modal medical imaging tasks, leveraging powerful vision foundation models pre-trained on natural images while addressing real-world clinical challenges such as missing data and limited annotations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Generalization of Graph Anomaly Detection: From Transfer Learning to Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06609v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted increasing attention in recent years for identifying malicious samples in a wide range of graph-based applications, such as social media and e-commerce. However, most GAD methods assume identical training and testing distributions and are tailored to specific tasks, resulting in limited adaptability to real-world scenarios such as shifting data distributions and scarce training samples in new applications. To address the limitations, recent work has focused on improving the generalization capability of GAD models through transfer learning that leverages knowledge from related domains to enhance detection performance, or developing "one-for-all" GAD foundation models that generalize across multiple applications. Since a systematic understanding of generalization in GAD is still lacking, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of generalization in GAD. We first trace the evolution of generalization in GAD and formalize the problem settings, which further leads to our systematic taxonomy. Rooted in this fine-grained taxonomy, an up-to-date and comprehensive review is conducted for the existing generalized GAD methods. Finally, we identify current open challenges and suggest future directions to inspire future research in this emerging field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICKG 2025. 8 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[QualityFM: a Multimodal Physiological Signal Foundation Model with Self-Distillation for Signal Quality Challenges in Critically Ill Patients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06516v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) are commonly recorded in intesive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR). However, the high incidence of poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms or diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited generalizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task transferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel multimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to acquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is pre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second waveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track architecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality, leveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality signals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To efficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local quasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism within our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function, which combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect reconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation of frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models with varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy and practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks: false alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial fibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and ECG signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[WindFM: An Open-Source Foundation Model for Zero-Shot Wind Power Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06311v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality wind power forecasting is crucial for the operation of modern power grids. However, prevailing data-driven paradigms either train a site-specific model which cannot generalize to other locations or rely on fine-tuning of general-purpose time series foundation models which are difficult to incorporate domain-specific data in the energy sector. This paper introduces WindFM, a lightweight and generative Foundation Model designed specifically for probabilistic wind power forecasting. WindFM employs a discretize-and-generate framework. A specialized time-series tokenizer first converts continuous multivariate observations into discrete, hierarchical tokens. Subsequently, a decoder-only Transformer learns a universal representation of wind generation dynamics by autoregressively pre-training on these token sequences. Using the comprehensive WIND Toolkit dataset comprising approximately 150 billion time steps from more than 126,000 sites, WindFM develops a foundational understanding of the complex interplay between atmospheric conditions and power output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our compact 8.1M parameter model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on both deterministic and probabilistic tasks, outperforming specialized models and larger foundation models without any fine-tuning. In particular, WindFM exhibits strong adaptiveness under out-of-distribution data from a different continent, demonstrating the robustness and transferability of its learned representations. Our pre-trained model is publicly available at https://github.com/shiyu-coder/WindFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Software Engineering: Foundational Pillars and a Research Roadmap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06216v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Software Engineering (SE 3.0) represents a new era where intelligent agents are tasked not with simple code generation, but with achieving complex, goal-oriented SE objectives. To harness these new capabilities while ensuring trustworthiness, we must recognize a fundamental duality within the SE field in the Agentic SE era, comprising two symbiotic modalities: SE for Humans and SE for Agents. This duality demands a radical reimagining of the foundational pillars of SE (actors, processes, tools, and artifacts) which manifest differently across each modality. We propose two purpose-built workbenches to support this vision. The Agent Command Environment (ACE) serves as a command center where humans orchestrate and mentor agent teams, handling outputs such as Merge-Readiness Packs (MRPs) and Consultation Request Packs (CRPs). The Agent Execution Environment (AEE) is a digital workspace where agents perform tasks while invoking human expertise when facing ambiguity or complex trade-offs. This bi-directional partnership, which supports agent-initiated human callbacks and handovers, gives rise to new, structured engineering activities (i.e., processes) that redefine human-AI collaboration, elevating the practice from agentic coding to true agentic software engineering. This paper presents the Structured Agentic Software Engineering (SASE) vision, outlining several of the foundational pillars for the future of SE. The paper culminates in a research roadmap that identifies a few key challenges and opportunities while briefly discussing the resulting impact of this future on SE education. Our goal is not to offer a definitive solution, but to provide a conceptual scaffold with structured vocabulary to catalyze a community-wide dialogue, pushing the SE community to think beyond its classic, human-centric tenets toward a disciplined, scalable, and trustworthy agentic future.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedSeqFT: Sequential Fine-tuning Foundation Models for 3D Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06096v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies, however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore, evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective, knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving clinical tasks. Code will be released.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Unified Interaction Foundational Model (UIFM) for Predicting Complex User and System Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06025v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central goal of artificial intelligence is to build systems that can understand and predict complex, evolving sequences of events. However, current foundation models, designed for natural language, fail to grasp the holistic nature of structured interactions found in domains like telecommunications, e-commerce and finance. By serializing events into text, they disassemble them into semantically fragmented parts, losing critical context. In this work, we introduce the Unified Interaction Foundation Model (UIFM), a foundation model engineered for genuine behavioral understanding. At its core is the principle of composite tokenization, where each multi-attribute event is treated as a single, semantically coherent unit. This allows UIFM to learn the underlying "grammar" of user behavior, perceiving entire interactions rather than a disconnected stream of data points. We demonstrate that this architecture is not just more accurate, but represents a fundamental step towards creating more adaptable and intelligent predictive systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compression Beyond Pixels: Semantic Compression with Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05925v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks. These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets, achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at IEEE 35th Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)</p></details> |

And can their internal representations be leveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To investigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments of one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period) during the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts: injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm semantics suppresses crashes and restores stability. Beyond binary control, we find that models encode a graded notion of event severity, with the latent vector norm directly correlating with the magnitude of systemic shocks. Validated across two architecturally distinct TSFMs, Toto (decoder only) and Chronos (encoder-decoder), our results demonstrate that steerable, semantically grounded representations are a robust property of large time series transformers. Our findings provide evidence for a latent concept space that governs model predictions, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution to direct causal intervention, and enabling semantic "what-if" analysis for strategic stress-testing.</p></details> |  |

This paper aims to bridge this gap by presenting a step-by-step guideline proposing a workflow for dynamic analysis of structures with pile foundations. The proposed workflow encompasses instructions on how to use Domain Reduction Method for loading, Perfectly Matched Layer elements for wave absorption, soil-structure interaction modeling using Embedded interface elements, and domain decomposition for efficient use of processing units. Through a series of numerical simulations, we showcase the practical application of this workflow. Our results reveal the efficacy of the Domain Reduction Method in reducing simulation size without compromising model fidelity, show the precision of Perfectly Matched Layer elements in modeling infinite domains, highlight the efficiency of Embedded Interface elements in establishing connections between structures and the soil domain, and demonstrate the overall effectiveness of the proposed workflow in conducting high-fidelity simulations. While our study focuses on simplified geometries and loading scenarios, it serves as a foundational framework for future research endeavors aimed at exploring more intricate structural configurations and dynamic loading conditions</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 20 figures, conference paper, Proceedings of the XVII PCSMGE</p></details> |

Most approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach, effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge, enabling practical and general relighting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yoterel.github.io/PractiLight-project-page/</p></details> |

These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning models capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model generalization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable candidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: multi-modal multi-task foundation models (M3T-FMs) provide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas federated learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed, privacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization. However, when used in isolation, each of these approaches falls short of meeting the complex and diverse capability requirements of real-world embodied AI environments. In this vision paper, we introduce multi-modal multi-task federated foundation models (M3T-FFMs) for embodied AI, a new paradigm that unifies the strengths of M3T-FMs with the privacy-preserving distributed training nature of FL, enabling intelligent systems at the wireless edge. We collect critical deployment dimensions of M3T-FFMs in embodied AI ecosystems under a unified framework, which we name "EMBODY": Embodiment heterogeneity, Modality richness and imbalance, Bandwidth and compute constraints, On-device continual learning, Distributed control and autonomy, and Yielding safety, privacy, and personalization. For each, we identify concrete challenges and envision actionable research directions. We also present an evaluation framework for deploying M3T-FFMs in embodied AI systems, along with the associated trade-offs. Finally, we present a prototype implementation of M3T-FFMs and evaluate their energy and latency performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in IEEE Internet of Things Magazine, 2025</p></details> |

As more complex foundational models gain widespread use, the need to expand training resources and integrate privately owned data grows as well. In this article, we explore the intersection of federated learning and foundational models, aiming to identify, categorize, and characterize technical methods that integrate the two paradigms. As a unified survey is currently unavailable, we present a literature survey structured around a novel taxonomy that follows the development life-cycle stages, along with a technical comparison of available methods. Additionally, we provide practical insights and guidelines for implementing and evolving these methods, with a specific focus on the healthcare domain as a case study, where the potential impact of federated learning and foundational models is considered significant. Our survey covers multiple intersecting topics, including but not limited to federated learning, self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, distillation, and transfer learning. Initially, we retrieved and reviewed a set of over 4,200 articles. This collection was narrowed to more than 250 thoroughly reviewed articles through inclusion criteria, featuring 42 unique methods. The methods were used to construct the taxonomy and enabled their comparison based on complexity, efficiency, and scalability. We present these results as a self-contained overview that not only summarizes the state of the field but also provides insights into the practical aspects of adopting, evolving, and integrating foundational models with federated learning.</p></details> |  |

However, most artificial intelligence (AI) models for EHRs are designed for narrow, single-purpose tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world settings. Here, we present CEHR-XGPT, a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that unifies three essential capabilities - feature representation, zero-shot prediction, and synthetic data generation - within a single architecture. To support temporal reasoning over clinical sequences, CEHR-XGPT incorporates a novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients' dynamic timelines into the model structure. CEHR-XGPT demonstrates strong performance across all three tasks and generalizes effectively to external datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning. Its versatility enables rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting without the need for task-specific retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Video-to-Audio Generation via Multiple Foundation Models Mapper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04957v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming, requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[FloodVision: Urban Flood Depth Estimation Using Foundation Vision-Language Models and Domain Knowledge Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04772v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart city flood resilience.</p></details> |  |

Theoretical Foundations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23081v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper establishes the theoretical foundations of the online scaled gradient methods (OSGM), a framework that utilizes online learning to adapt stepsizes and provably accelerate first-order methods. OSGM quantifies the effectiveness of a stepsize by a feedback function motivated from a convergence measure and uses the feedback to adjust the stepsize through an online learning algorithm. Consequently, instantiations of OSGM achieve convergence rates that are asymptotically no worse than the optimal stepsize. OSGM yields desirable convergence guarantees on smooth convex problems, including 1) trajectory-dependent global convergence on smooth convex objectives; 2) an improved complexity result on smooth strongly convex problems, and 3) local superlinear convergence. Notably, OSGM constitutes a new family of first-order methods with non-asymptotic superlinear convergence, joining the celebrated quasi-Newton methods. Finally, OSGM explains the empirical success of the popular hypergradient-descent heuristic in optimization for machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extension of arXiv:2411.01803 and arXiv:2502.11229</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Foundation Model-Driven User Interest Modeling and Behavior Analysis on Short Video Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04751v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid expansion of user bases on short video platforms, personalized recommendation systems are playing an increasingly critical role in enhancing user experience and optimizing content distribution. Traditional interest modeling methods often rely on unimodal data, such as click logs or text labels, which limits their ability to fully capture user preferences in a complex multimodal content environment. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a multimodal foundation model-based framework for user interest modeling and behavior analysis. By integrating video frames, textual descriptions, and background music into a unified semantic space using cross-modal alignment strategies, the framework constructs fine-grained user interest vectors. Additionally, we introduce a behavior-driven feature embedding mechanism that incorporates viewing, liking, and commenting sequences to model dynamic interest evolution, thereby improving both the timeliness and accuracy of recommendations. In the experimental phase, we conduct extensive evaluations using both public and proprietary short video datasets, comparing our approach against multiple mainstream recommendation algorithms and modeling techniques. Results demonstrate significant improvements in behavior prediction accuracy, interest modeling for cold-start users, and recommendation click-through rates. Moreover, we incorporate interpretability mechanisms using attention weights and feature visualization to reveal the model's decision basis under multimodal inputs and trace interest shifts, thereby enhancing the transparency and controllability of the recommendation system.</p></details> |  |

Through contrastive learning and multi-task optimization, ALF creates unified advertiser representations that capture both content and behavioral patterns. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on critical tasks including fraud detection, policy violation identification, and advertiser similarity matching. In production deployment, ALF demonstrates significant real-world impact by delivering simultaneous gains in both precision and recall, for instance boosting recall by over 40 percentage points on one critical policy and increasing precision to 99.8% on another. The architecture's effectiveness stems from its novel combination of multi-modal transformations, inter-sample attention mechanism, spectrally normalized projections, and calibrated probabilistic outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reasoning for PDE Foundation Models: A Reward-Model-Driven Inference-Time-Scaling Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02846v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking" strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational workflows in physics and engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sailing Towards Zero-Shot State Estimation using Foundation Models Combined with a UKF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04213v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation in control and systems engineering traditionally requires extensive manual system identification or data-collection effort. However, transformer-based foundation models in other domains have reduced data requirements by leveraging pre-trained generalist models. Ultimately, developing zero-shot foundation models of system dynamics could drastically reduce manual deployment effort. While recent work shows that transformer-based end-to-end approaches can achieve zero-shot performance on unseen systems, they are limited to sensor models seen during training. We introduce the foundation model unscented Kalman filter (FM-UKF), which combines a transformer-based model of system dynamics with analytically known sensor models via an UKF, enabling generalization across varying dynamics without retraining for new sensor configurations. We evaluate FM-UKF on a new benchmark of container ship models with complex dynamics, demonstrating a competitive accuracy, effort, and robustness trade-off compared to classical methods with approximate system knowledge and to an end-to-end approach. The benchmark and dataset are open sourced to further support future research in zero-shot state estimation via foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at CDC2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches either focus on general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation, and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extreme and general weather forecasting, showcasing superior adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 80 figures, submitted to ACM KDD 2026 conference</p></details> |
| **[Beyond holography: the entropic quantum gravity foundations of image processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14048v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is increasing scientific attention in establishing the connections between theoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has formulated the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) approach to quantum gravity in which gravity is derived from the geometric quantum relative entropy (GQRE) between two metrics associated with the Lorentzian spacetime. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow of the GfE action in its simple warm-up scenario. Specifically, this algorithm is the outcome of the minimization of the GQRE between two Euclidean metrics: the one of the support of the image and the one induced by the image. As the Perona-Malik algorithm is known to preserve sharp contours, this implies that the GfE action, does not in general lead to uniform images upon iteration of the gradient flow dynamics as it would be intuitively expected from entropic actions maximising classical entropies. Rather, the outcome of the minimization of the GQRE is compatible with the preservation of complex structures. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and might contribute to establish deeper connections between GfE, machine learning and brain research.</p></details> | (7 pages, 1 figure) |

The analysis begins with foundational architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks. Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new paradigm by applying the Transformer architecture to sequences of image patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale image recognition. Building on these visual representation backbones, we investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher, yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective method for pre-training large-scale vision models.</p></details> |  |

In ophthalmology, RETFound, a retina-specific FM pre-trained sequentially on 1.4 million natural images and 1.6 million retinal images, has demonstrated high adaptability across clinical applications. Conversely, DINOv2, a general-purpose vision FM pre-trained on 142 million natural images, has shown promise in non-medical domains. However, its applicability to clinical tasks remains underexplored. To address this, we conducted head-to-head evaluations by fine-tuning RETFound and three DINOv2 models (large, base, small) for ocular disease detection and systemic disease prediction tasks, across eight standardized open-source ocular datasets, as well as the Moorfields AlzEye and the UK Biobank datasets. DINOv2-large model outperformed RETFound in detecting diabetic retinopathy (AUROC=0.850-0.952 vs 0.823-0.944, across three datasets, all P<=0.007) and multi-class eye diseases (AUROC=0.892 vs. 0.846, P<0.001). In glaucoma, DINOv2-base model outperformed RETFound (AUROC=0.958 vs 0.940, P<0.001). Conversely, RETFound achieved superior performance over all DINOv2 models in predicting heart failure, myocardial infarction, and ischaemic stroke (AUROC=0.732-0.796 vs 0.663-0.771, all P<0.001). These trends persisted even with 10% of the fine-tuning data. These findings showcase the distinct scenarios where general-purpose and domain-specific FMs excel, highlighting the importance of aligning FM selection with task-specific requirements to optimise clinical performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Ophthalmology Science and is currently in press</p></details> |
| **[A Foundation Model for Chest X-ray Interpretation with Grounded Reasoning via Online Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03906v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical foundation models (FMs) have shown tremendous promise amid the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, current medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities, then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent) tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR interpretation.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[A Generative Foundation Model for Chest Radiography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03903v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finetuning AI Foundation Models to Develop Subgrid-Scale Parameterizations: A Case Study on Atmospheric Gravity Waves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03816v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global climate models parameterize a range of atmospheric-oceanic processes like gravity waves, clouds, moist convection, and turbulence that cannot be sufficiently resolved. These subgrid-scale closures for unresolved processes are a leading source of model uncertainty. Here, we present a new approach to developing machine learning parameterizations of small-scale climate processes by fine-tuning a pre-trained AI foundation model (FM). FMs are largely unexplored in climate research. A pre-trained encoder-decoder from a 2.3 billion parameter FM (NASA and IBM Research's Prithvi WxC) -- which contains a latent probabilistic representation of atmospheric evolution -- is fine-tuned (or reused) to create a deep learning parameterization for atmospheric gravity waves (GWs). The parameterization captures GW effects for a coarse-resolution climate model by learning the fluxes from an atmospheric reanalysis with 10 times finer resolution. A comparison of monthly averages and instantaneous evolution with a machine learning model baseline (an Attention U-Net) reveals superior predictive performance of the FM parameterization throughout the atmosphere, even in regions excluded from pre-training. This performance boost is quantified using the Hellinger distance, which is 0.11 for the baseline and 0.06 for the fine-tuned model. Our findings emphasize the versatility and reusability of FMs, which could be used to accomplish a range of atmosphere- and climate-related applications, leading the way for the creation of observations-driven and physically accurate parameterizations for more earth-system processes.</p></details> |  |

Accurate differentiation is therefore essential for patient prognostication and resource allocation, yet remains challenging even for expert pathologists. Here, we leveraged Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs) pre-trained on large histopathology datasets and applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning via low-rank adaptation. In addition, we incorporated ConvNeXt V2, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture, to complement PFMs. During training, we employed a fisheye transform to emphasize mitoses and Fourier Domain Adaptation using ImageNet target images. Finally, we ensembled multiple PFMs to integrate complementary morphological insights, achieving competitive balanced accuracy on the Preliminary Evaluation Phase dataset.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate embeddings from seven general and medical-specific foundation models (e.g., DenseNet121, BiomedCLIP, MedImageInsight, Rad-DINO, CXR-Foundation) for training lightweight adapters in multi-class radiography classification. Using a dataset of 8,842 radiographs across seven classes, we trained adapters with algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors, logistic regression, SVM, random forest, and MLP. The combination of MedImageInsight embeddings with an SVM or MLP adapter achieved the highest mean area under the curve (mAUC) of 93.1%. This performance was statistically superior to other models, including MedSigLIP with an MLP (91.0%), Rad-DINO with an SVM (90.7%), and CXR-Foundation with logistic regression (88.6%). In contrast, models like BiomedCLIP (82.8%) and Med-Flamingo (78.5%) showed lower performance. Crucially, these lightweight adapters are computationally efficient, training in minutes and performing inference in seconds on a CPU, making them practical for clinical use. A fairness analysis of the top-performing MedImageInsight adapter revealed minimal performance disparities across patient gender (within 1.8%) and age groups (std. dev < 1.4%), with no significant statistical differences. These findings confirm that embeddings from specialized foundation models, particularly MedImageInsight, can power accurate, efficient, and equitable diagnostic tools using simple, lightweight adapters.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

As these models continued to grow, leveraging geo-distributed data from wireless devices has become increasingly critical, giving rise to federated foundation models (FFMs). More recently, FMs have evolved into multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs (e.g., GPT-4) capable of processing diverse modalities across multiple tasks, which motivates a new underexplored paradigm: M3T FFMs. In this paper, we unveil an unexplored variation of M3T FFMs by proposing hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), which in turn expose two overlooked heterogeneity dimensions to fog/edge networks that have a direct impact on these emerging models: (i) heterogeneity in collected modalities and (ii) heterogeneity in executed tasks across fog/edge nodes. HF-FMs strategically align the modular structure of M3T FMs, comprising modality encoders, prompts, mixture-of-experts (MoEs), adapters, and task heads, with the hierarchical nature of fog/edge infrastructures. Moreover, HF-FMs enable the optional usage of device-to-device (D2D) communications, enabling horizontal module relaying and localized cooperative training among nodes when feasible. Through delving into the architectural design of HF-FMs, we highlight their unique capabilities along with a series of tailored future research directions. Finally, to demonstrate their potential, we prototype HF-FMs in a wireless network setting and release the open-source code for the development of HF-FMs with the goal of fostering exploration in this untapped field (GitHub: https://github.com/payamsiabd/M3T-FFM).</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

The advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/jigang-fan/SafeProtein.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Foundations of Tuning without Forgetting in Neural ODEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03474v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In our earlier work, we introduced the principle of Tuning without Forgetting (TwF) for sequential training of neural ODEs, where training samples are added iteratively and parameters are updated within the subspace of control functions that preserves the end-point mapping at previously learned samples on the manifold of output labels in the first-order approximation sense. In this letter, we prove that this parameter subspace forms a Banach submanifold of finite codimension under nonsingular controls, and we characterize its tangent space. This reveals that TwF corresponds to a continuation/deformation of the control function along the tangent space of this Banach submanifold, providing a theoretical foundation for its mapping-preserving (not forgetting) during the sequential training exactly, beyond first-order approximation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalist versus Specialist Vision Foundation Models for Ocular Disease and Oculomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03421v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical foundation models, pre-trained with large-scale clinical data, demonstrate strong performance in diverse clinically relevant applications. RETFound, trained on nearly one million retinal images, exemplifies this approach in applications with retinal images. However, the emergence of increasingly powerful and multifold larger generalist foundation models such as DINOv2 and DINOv3 raises the question of whether domain-specific pre-training remains essential, and if so, what gap persists. To investigate this, we systematically evaluated the adaptability of DINOv2 and DINOv3 in retinal image applications, compared to two specialist RETFound models, RETFound-MAE and RETFound-DINOv2. We assessed performance on ocular disease detection and systemic disease prediction using two adaptation strategies: fine-tuning and linear probing. Data efficiency and adaptation efficiency were further analysed to characterise trade-offs between predictive performance and computational cost. Our results show that although scaling generalist models yields strong adaptability across diverse tasks, RETFound-DINOv2 consistently outperforms these generalist foundation models in ocular-disease detection and oculomics tasks, demonstrating stronger generalisability and data efficiency. These findings suggest that specialist retinal foundation models remain the most effective choice for clinical applications, while the narrowing gap with generalist foundation models suggests that continued data and model scaling can deliver domain-relevant gains and position them as strong foundations for future medical foundation models.</p></details> | 39 pages, 8 Figures |

The framework is underpinned by following six key components: (1) a comprehensive and accurate dataset, constructed via the scalable GUI Data Pipeline, which aggregates the largest and most diverse GUI-centric multimodal data to date from open-source repositories, automated crawling, and targeted manual annotation; (2) enhanced perception and grounding capabilities, facilitating fine-grained multimodal alignment for UI element referencing, grounding, and screen comprehension; (3) a comprehensive and unified action space, encompassing both fundamental UI operations and complex interactive intents to support human-agent interactions; (4) planning-oriented reasoning mechanisms that enable the model to decompose complex user instructions into sequential actions with explicit intermediate meta-paln reasoning; (5) an iterative two-stage training procedure, combining large-scale continue pre-training on 7.8M samples with reinforcement fine-tuning utilizing a spatially enhanced composite reward and dual filtering strategy; and (6) competitive performance on both the proprietary Magic-RICH benchmark and over a dozen public benchmarks, achieving superior performance across GUI perception and agent tasks, while demonstrating robust generalization and real-world deployment potential in practical mobile GUI scenarios, as detailed in Figure 1.</p></details> |  |
| **[FoMEMO: Towards Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03244v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expensive multi-objective optimization is a prevalent and crucial concern in many real-world scenarios, where sample-efficiency is vital due to the limited evaluations to recover the true Pareto front for decision making. Existing works either involve rebuilding Gaussian process surrogates from scratch for each objective in each new problem encountered, or rely on extensive past domain experiments for pre-training deep learning models, making them hard to generalize and impractical to cope with various emerging applications in the real world. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm named FoMEMO (Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization), which enables the establishment of a foundation model conditioned on any domain trajectory and user preference, and facilitates fast in-context optimization based on the predicted preference-wise aggregation posteriors. Rather than accessing extensive domain experiments in the real world, we demonstrate that pre-training the foundation model with a diverse set of hundreds of millions of synthetic data can lead to superior adaptability to unknown problems, without necessitating any subsequent model training or updates in the optimization process. We evaluate our method across a variety of synthetic benchmarks and real-word applications, and demonstrate its superior generality and competitive performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Two tasks are addressed: (1) predicting the spatial variation of undrained shear strength (su) across borehole depth profiles, and (2) imputing missing mechanical parameters in a dense-site dataset. We apply TabPFN in a zero-training, few-shot, in-context learning setting - without hyper-parameter tuning - and provide it with additional context from the big indirect database (BID). The study demonstrates that TabPFN, as a general-purpose foundation model, achieved superior accuracy and well-calibrated predictive distributions compared to a conventional hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) baseline, while also offering significant gains in inference efficiency. In Benchmark Problem #1 (spatial su prediction), TabPFN outperformed the HBM in prediction accuracy and delivered an order-of-magnitude faster runtime. In Benchmark Problem #2 (missing mechanical parameter imputation), TabPFN likewise achieved lower RMSE for all target parameters with well-quantified uncertainties, though its cumulative computation cost was higher than HBM's due to its one-variable-at-a-time inference. These results mark the first successful use of a tabular foundation model in geotechnical modeling, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in probabilistic site characterization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Cardiac MRI Foundation Models: Comprehensive Visual-Tabular Representations for Whole-Heart Assessment and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13037v4)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive cardiac assessment, offering rich spatio-temporal views of the cardiac anatomy and physiology. Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic, and lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and disease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand cardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an individual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly exploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have begun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data and focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a comprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a comprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of individual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants, ViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling a complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with detailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This multi-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including cardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and classification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified framework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging features and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific models toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health, highlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in cardiac analysis.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods, relying on language-level knowledge, fail to capture dynamic, item-level user interests across domains. To bridge this gap, we propose RecBase, a domain-agnostic foundational model pretrained with a recommendation-oriented objective. RecBase leverages a large-scale, heterogeneous, cross-domain corpus with unified textual representations and feature mappings to enhance cross-domain generalization. To further align item semantics across domains, we introduce a unified item tokenizer that encodes items into hierarchical concept identifiers, enabling structured representation and efficient vocabulary sharing. The model is trained using an autoregressive objective to capture complex item-level sequential patterns. On eight real-world datasets, our 1.5B-parameter model matches or surpasses the performance of LLM baselines up to 7B parameters in zero-shot and cross-domain recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models (FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We introduce MedDINOv3, a simple and effective framework for adapting DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform domain-adaptive pretraining on CT-3M, a curated collection of 3.87M axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense features.

| **[Fidelity-preserving enhancement of ptychography with foundational text-to-image models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04513v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ptychographic phase retrieval enables high-resolution imaging of complex samples but often suffers from artifacts such as grid pathology and multislice crosstalk, which degrade reconstructed images. We propose a plug-and-play (PnP) framework that integrates physics model-based phase retrieval with text-guided image editing using foundational diffusion models. By employing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), our approach ensures consensus between data fidelity and artifact removal subproblems, maintaining physics consistency while enhancing image quality. Artifact removal is achieved using a text-guided diffusion image editing method (LEDITS++) with a pre-trained foundational diffusion model, allowing users to specify artifacts for removal in natural language. Demonstrations on simulated and experimental datasets show significant improvements in artifact suppression and structural fidelity, validated by metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and diffraction pattern consistency. This work highlights the combination of text-guided generative models and model-based phase retrieval algorithms as a transferable and fidelity-preserving method for high-quality diffraction imaging.</p></details> |  |

The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on Earth.</p></details> |  |

The advent of Large Foundation Models (LFMs) has greatly expanded its potential, offering unprecedented capabilities by leveraging vast amounts of data to understand and predict complex patterns. At the same time, realizing this potential responsibly requires addressing persistent challenges related to safety, fairness, and control. This paper reviews the crucial integration of LFMs with HAI, highlighting both opportunities and risks. We structure our analysis around four areas: human-guided model development, collaborative design principles, ethical and governance frameworks, and applications in high-stakes domains. Our review shows that successful HAI systems are not the automatic result of stronger models but the product of careful, human-centered design. By identifying key open challenges, this survey aims to give insight into current and future research that turns the raw power of LFMs into partnerships that are reliable, trustworthy, and beneficial to society.</p></details> | <details><summary>Topic...</summary><p>Topic and scope refinement</p></details> |

EEG, crucial for diagnosing conditions like epilepsy, presents significant challenges due to its noisy, high-dimensional, and nonlinear nature. Traditional machine learning methods have made advances in automating EEG analysis but often fail to capture its complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in sequence modeling, offer new avenues for creating more generalized and expressive models capable of handling such complexities. By training a Mamba-based model on a large dataset containing seizure and non-seizure EEG recordings through a self-supervised reconstruction task followed by a seizure detection task, we demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an AUROC of 0.72 on a held-out test set. This approach marks a significant step toward developing large-scale, clinically applicable foundation models for EEG data analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward a robust lesion detection model in breast DCE-MRI: adapting foundation models to high-risk women](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02710v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate breast MRI lesion detection is critical for early cancer diagnosis, especially in high-risk populations. We present a classification pipeline that adapts a pretrained foundation model, the Medical Slice Transformer (MST), for breast lesion classification using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). Leveraging DINOv2-based self-supervised pretraining, MST generates robust per-slice feature embeddings, which are then used to train a Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (KAN) classifier. The KAN provides a flexible and interpretable alternative to conventional convolutional networks by enabling localized nonlinear transformations via adaptive B-spline activations. This enhances the model's ability to differentiate benign from malignant lesions in imbalanced and heterogeneous clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the MST+KAN pipeline outperforms the baseline MST classifier, achieving AUC = 0.80 \pm 0.02 while preserving interpretability through attention-based heatmaps. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of combining foundation model embeddings with advanced classification strategies for building robust and generalizable breast MRI analysis tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous and algebraic domains in univalent foundations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06956v5)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop the theory of continuous and algebraic domains in constructive and predicative univalent foundations, building upon our earlier work on basic domain theory in this setting. That we work predicatively means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice. To deal with size issues and give a predicatively suitable definition of continuity of a dcpo, we follow Johnstone and Joyal's work on continuous categories. Adhering to the univalent perspective, we explicitly distinguish between data and property. To ensure that being continuous is a property of a dcpo, we turn to the propositional truncation, although we explain that some care is needed to avoid needing the axiom of choice. We also adapt the notion of a domain-theoretic basis to the predicative setting by imposing suitable smallness conditions, analogous to the categorical concept of an accessible category. All our running examples of continuous dcpos are then actually examples of dcpos with small bases which we show to be well behaved predicatively. In particular, such dcpos are exactly those presented by small ideals. As an application of the theory, we show that Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus is an example of an algebraic dcpo with a small basis. Our work is formalised in the Agda proof assistant and its ability to infer universe levels has been invaluable for our purposes.</p></details> | <details><summary>v4: A...</summary><p>v4: Accepted for publication in the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra.

While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) and leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the development of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced general-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in real-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion Arena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected directly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model comparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect practical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the Bradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches, a cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated models, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that prioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize information gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and simulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable rankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced datasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation. By fostering an open alliance between foundation models and real-world applications, Inclusion Arena aims to accelerate the development of LLMs and MLLMs truly optimized for practical, user-centric deployments.

Leveraging the powerful multi-task learning capability, FMs hold the promise of unifying multiple tasks of wireless communication with a single framework. with a single framework. Nevertheless, existing wireless FMs face limitations in the uniformity to address multiple tasks with diverse inputs/outputs across different communication scenarios.In this paper, we propose a MUlti-taSk Environment-aware FM (MUSE-FM) with a unified architecture to handle multiple tasks in wireless communications, while effectively incorporating scenario information.Specifically, to achieve task uniformity, we propose a unified prompt-guided data encoder-decoder pair to handle data with heterogeneous formats and distributions across different tasks. Besides, we integrate the environmental context as a multi-modal input, which serves as prior knowledge of environment and channel distributions and facilitates cross-scenario feature extraction. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed MUSE-FM outperforms existing methods for various tasks, and its prompt-guided encoder-decoder pair improves the scalability for new task configurations. Moreover, the incorporation of environment information improves the ability to adapt to different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment in harsh or austere environments -- characterized by intermittent connectivity, limited computation, noisy data, and dynamically changing network topologies -- remains an open challenge. Existing distributed learning methods such as federated learning (FL) struggle to adapt in such settings due to their reliance on stable infrastructure, synchronized updates, and resource-intensive training. In this work, we explore the potential of Federated Foundation Models (FFMs) as a promising paradigm to address these limitations. By integrating the scalability and generalization power of FMs with novel decentralized, communication-aware FL frameworks, we aim to enable robust, energy-efficient, and adaptive intelligence in extreme and adversarial conditions. We present a detailed breakdown of system-level constraints in harsh environments, and discuss the open research challenges in communication design, model robustness, and energy-efficient personalization for these unique settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review in IEEE Network Magazine Special Issue on Large AI Models for the Internet of Everything</p></details> |

However, existing AI methods struggle with generalization across variables and geographies and are constrained by the quadratic complexity of Vision Transformer (ViT) self-attention. We introduce ORBIT-2, a scalable foundation model for global, hyper-resolution climate downscaling. ORBIT-2 incorporates two key innovations: (1) Residual Slim ViT (Reslim), a lightweight architecture with residual learning and Bayesian regularization for efficient, robust prediction; and (2) TILES, a tile-wise sequence scaling algorithm that reduces self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear, enabling long-sequence processing and massive parallelism. ORBIT-2 scales to 10 billion parameters across 65,536 GPUs, achieving up to 4.1 exaFLOPS sustained throughput and 74--98% strong scaling efficiency. It supports downscaling to 0.9 km global resolution and processes sequences up to 4.2 billion tokens. On 7 km resolution benchmarks, ORBIT-2 achieves high accuracy with $R^2$ scores in the range of 0.98--0.99 against observational data.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces VSLLaVA, a comprehensive pipeline that utilizes expert knowledge-guided instruction tuning and evaluation to create an end-to-end LMM for signal analysis. To achieve this, we construct a novel Signal-Question-Answer (SQA) dataset using an expert rule-based signal generator. This dataset facilitates a two-stage learning procedure. The first step is efficient instruction fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which imparts specialized signal identification capabilities. Subsequently, we designed a tailored Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine the reasoning capabilities and enhance classification robustness. Then, a dual-mode evaluation framework is proposed, combining an LLM referee with expert rules for semantic assessment using quantitative metrics for numerical and textual accuracy, which reveals that VSLLaVA significantly improves performance in signal type identification and parameter analysis, and makes progress in the identification and parameter analysis of fault-related signals. This research demonstrates a viable approach for developing specialized foundational models for complex industrial applications and marks a transition from conventional task-specific systems to a cohesive, interactive foundational model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Decoding for Robotics Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01728v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. These models are pretrained on vast datasets of robot trajectories to process multi-modal inputs and directly output a sequence of action that the system then executes in the real world. Although this approach is attractive from the perspective of improved generalization across diverse tasks, these models are still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral correctness and safety constraints. We address these limitations by introducing a constrained decoding framework for robotics foundation models that enforces logical constraints on action trajectories in dynamical systems. Our method ensures that generated actions provably satisfy signal temporal logic (STL) specifications at runtime without retraining, while remaining agnostic of the underlying foundation model. We perform comprehensive evaluation of our approach across state-of-the-art navigation foundation models and we show that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe actions but also for conditional action-generation.

| **[Simplifying Traffic Anomaly Detection with Video Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09338v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training, allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs. Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) advanced pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM) provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be built with minimal architectural complexity.

Abnormal patterns of neural signaling often indicate the presence of underlying brain diseases. The variability among individuals, the diverse array of clinical symptoms from various brain disorders, and the limited availability of diagnostic classifications, have posed significant barriers to formulating reliable model of neural signals for diverse application contexts. Here, we present BrainWave, the first foundation model for both invasive and non-invasive neural recordings, pretrained on more than 40,000 hours of electrical brain recordings (13.79 TB of data) from approximately 16,000 individuals. Our analysis show that BrainWave outperforms all other competing models and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the diagnosis and identification of neurological disorders. We also demonstrate robust capabilities of BrainWave in enabling zero-shot transfer learning across varying recording conditions and brain diseases, as well as few-shot classification without fine-tuning, suggesting that BrainWave learns highly generalizable representations of neural signals. We hence believe that open-sourcing BrainWave will facilitate a wide range of clinical applications in medicine, paving the way for AI-driven approaches to investigate brain disorders and advance neuroscience research.</p></details> | 32 pages, 14 figures |
| **[A Unified Low-level Foundation Model for Enhancing Pathology Image Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01071v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable, stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5 staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements (p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual staining.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing agent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after deployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving environments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution techniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction data and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation for self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation models with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for self-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified conceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of self-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components: System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a foundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this framework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques that target different components of the agent system. We also investigate domain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as biomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are tightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated discussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for self-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their effectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents, laying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and lifelong agentic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github Repo: https://github.com/EvoAgentX/Awesome-Self-Evolving-Agents</p></details> |

A multi-view convolution-transformer masked autoencoder, named as CineMA, was trained on 15 million cine images from 74,916 subjects. The model was validated on multiple image analysis tasks and compared to existing models on >4,500 images from eight independent datasets with diverse population characteristics, representing the largest benchmark study for cine CMR so far. CineMA consistently outperformed conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in delineating ventricular boundaries and estimating ejection fraction, a key measure of cardiac function. The improved performance was preserved, even when the model only used half of fine-tuning data. CineMA also surpassed CNNs in disease detection and matched their performance in long-axis function measurement. Interestingly, we found that CineMA can also detect cardiac changes in systemic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer, and can also predict mortality. Finally, we assessed model fairness and demonstrated consistent model performance across demographic subgroups. These findings highlight CineMA's accuracy, learning efficiency, adaptability, and fairness, underscoring its potential as a foundation model for automated cardiac image analysis to support clinical workflow and cardiovascular research.

This prevents broad applicability to diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging. With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth" mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities.

However, due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.</p></details> |  |

The rapid advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However, building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents, featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development. It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning. In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps, and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.</p></details> | 24 pages |

To address these issues, we propose a low-cost real-time framework for industrial action recognition using foundation models, denoted as LRIAR, to enhance recognition accuracy and transferability while minimizing human annotation and computational overhead. The proposed framework constructs an automatically labeled dataset by coupling Grounding DINO with the pretrained BLIP-2 image encoder, enabling efficient and scalable action labeling. Leveraging the constructed dataset, we train YOLOv5 for real-time action detection, and a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier is deceloped via LoRA-based fine-tuning for action classification. Extensive experiments conducted in real-world industrial settings validate the effectiveness of LRIAR, demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods in recognition accuracy, scenario generalization, and deployment efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[BrainGPT: Unleashing the Potential of EEG Generalist Foundation Model by Autoregressive Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19779v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are pivotal in providing insights into spontaneous brain activity, highlighting their significant importance in neuroscience research. However, the exploration of versatile EEG models is constrained by diverse data formats, outdated pre-training paradigms, and limited transfer learning methods, only leading to specialist models on single dataset. In this paper, we introduce EEGPT, the first generalist EEG foundation model designed to address these challenges. First, we propose an electrode-wise modeling strategy that treats each electrode as a fundamental unit, enabling the integration of diverse EEG datasets collected from up to 138 electrodes, amassing 37.5M pre-training samples. Second, we develop the first autoregressive EEG pre-trained model, moving away from traditional masked autoencoder approaches to a next signal prediction task that better captures the sequential and temporal dependencies of EEG data. We also explore scaling laws with model up to 1.1B parameters: the largest in EEG research to date. Third, we introduce a multi-task transfer learning paradigm using a learnable electrode graph network shared across tasks, which for the first time confirms multi-task compatibility and synergy. As the first generalist EEG foundation model, EEGPT shows broad compatibility with various signal acquisition devices, subjects, and tasks. It supports up to 138 electrodes and any combination thereof as input. Furthermore, we simultaneously evaluate it on 5 distinct tasks across 12 benchmarks. EEGPT consistently outperforms existing specialist models across all downstream tasks, with its effectiveness further validated through extensive ablation studies. This work sets a new direction for generalist EEG modeling, offering improved scalability, transferability, and adaptability for a wide range of EEG applications. The code and models will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Recabilities of Foundation Models: A Multi-Domain, Multi-Dataset Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21354v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Comprehensive evaluation of the recommendation capabilities of existing foundation models across diverse datasets and domains is essential for advancing the development of recommendation foundation models. In this study, we introduce RecBench-MD, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the recommendation abilities of foundation models from a zero-resource, multi-dataset, and multi-domain perspective. Through extensive evaluations of 19 foundation models across 15 datasets spanning 10 diverse domains -- including e-commerce, entertainment, and social media -- we identify key characteristics of these models in recommendation tasks. Our findings suggest that in-domain fine-tuning achieves optimal performance, while cross-dataset transfer learning provides effective practical support for new recommendation scenarios. Additionally, we observe that multi-domain training significantly enhances the adaptability of foundation models. All code and data have been publicly released to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Scientific Large Language Models: From Data Foundations to Agent Frontiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21148v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs, from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270 pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands -- heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dino U-Net: Exploiting High-Fidelity Dense Features from Foundation Models for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20909v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the 7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the accuracy of medical image segmentation.

| **[Turning Tabular Foundation Models into Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20906v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed. However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone. Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover, after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for graph machine learning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Foundation Model for Dental Caries Detection with Dual-View Co-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20813v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets, indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.</p></details> |  |
