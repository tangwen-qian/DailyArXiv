| **[Joint identification of spatially variable genes via a network-assisted Bayesian regularization approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05241v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying genes that display spatial patterns is critical to investigating expression interactions within a spatial context and further dissecting biological understanding of complex mechanistic functionality. Despite the increase in statistical methods designed to identify spatially variable genes, they are mostly based on marginal analysis and share the limitation that the dependence (network) structures among genes are not well accommodated, where a biological process usually involves changes in multiple genes that interact in a complex network. Moreover, the latent cellular composition within spots may introduce confounding variations, negatively affecting identification accuracy. In this study, we develop a novel Bayesian regularization approach for spatial transcriptomic data, with the confounding variations induced by varying cellular distributions effectively corrected. Significantly advancing from the existing studies, a thresholded graph Laplacian regularization is proposed to simultaneously identify spatially variable genes and accommodate the network structure among genes. The proposed method is based on a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution, effectively accommodating the count nature, zero inflation, and overdispersion of spatial transcriptomic data. Extensive simulations and the application to real data demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[ContextFlow: Context-Aware Flow Matching For Trajectory Inference From Spatial Omics Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02952v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring trajectories from longitudinal spatially-resolved omics data is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of structural and functional tissue changes in development, regeneration and repair, disease progression, and response to treatment. We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically, ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints, ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence. Our code is available at: \href{https://github.com/santanurathod/ContextFlow}{ContextFlow}</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 9 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[An Architecture for Spatial Networking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22687v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical spaces are increasingly dense with networked devices, promising seamless coordination and ambient intelligence. Yet today, cloud-first architectures force all communication through wide-area networks regardless of physical proximity. We lack an abstraction for spatial networking: using physical spaces to create boundaries for private, robust, and low-latency communication. We introduce $\textit{Bifr\"ost}$, a programming model that realizes spatial networking using bigraphs to express both containment and connectivity, enabling policies to be scoped by physical boundaries, devices to be named by location, the instantiation of spatial services, and the composition of spaces while maintaining local autonomy. Bifr\"ost enables a new class of spatially-aware applications, where co-located devices communicate directly, physical barriers require explicit gateways, and local control bridges to global coordination.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling Multiplex Spatial-Temporal Transition Graph Representation Learning for Socially Enhanced POI Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07649v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a research hotspot in business intelligence, where users' spatial-temporal transitions and social relationships play key roles. However, most existing works model spatial and temporal transitions separately, leading to misaligned representations of the same spatial-temporal key nodes. This misalignment introduces redundant information during fusion, increasing model uncertainty and reducing interpretability. To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced POI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over multiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs. The model employs a novel Disentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE), which first disentangles shared and private distributions using a multiplex spatial-temporal graph strategy. It then fuses the shared features via a Product of Experts (PoE) mechanism and denoises the private features through contrastive constraints. The model effectively captures the spatial-temporal transition representations of POIs while preserving the intrinsic correlation of their spatial-temporal relationships. Experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that our DiMuST significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>The o...</summary><p>The original paper has issues and has been restructured in the work; it is no longer suitable, so I am applying for withdrawal</p></details> |
| **[A Novel Unified Lightweight Temporal-Spatial Transformer Approach for Intrusion Detection in Drone Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02711v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing integration of drones across commercial, industrial, and civilian domains has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly due to the susceptibility of drone networks to a wide range of cyberattacks. Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability, efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource constrained environments in which drones operate. This paper proposes TSLT-Net, a novel lightweight and unified Temporal Spatial Transformer based intrusion detection system tailored specifically for drone networks. By leveraging self attention mechanisms, TSLT-Net effectively models both temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records, demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable parameters. These results establish TSLT-Net as an effective and scalable solution for real time drone cybersecurity, particularly suitable for deployment on edge devices in mission critical UAV systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 18 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[RichControl: Structure- and Appearance-Rich Training-Free Spatial Control for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02792v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., canny edge) for fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning-based approaches. However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly from natural RGB distributions. Through an empirical analysis of existing methods, we identify a key limitation: the sampling schedule of condition features, previously unexplored, fails to account for the evolving interplay between structure preservation and domain alignment throughout diffusion steps. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible training-free framework that decouples the sampling schedule of condition features from the denoising process, and systematically investigate the spectrum of feature injection schedules for a higher-quality structure guidance in the feature space. Specifically, we find that condition features sampled from a single timestep are sufficient, yielding a simple yet efficient schedule that balances structure alignment and appearance quality. We further enhance the sampling process by introducing a restart refinement schedule, and improve the visual quality with an appearance-rich prompting strategy. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse zero-shot conditioning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[WaveNet-SF: A Hybrid Network for Retinal Disease Detection Based on Wavelet Transform in Spatial-Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11854v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retinal diseases are a leading cause of vision impairment and blindness, with timely diagnosis being critical for effective treatment. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has become a standard imaging modality for retinal disease diagnosis, but OCT images often suffer from issues such as speckle noise, complex lesion shapes, and varying lesion sizes, making interpretation challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, WaveNet-SF, to enhance retinal disease detection by integrating the spatial-domain and frequency-domain learning. The framework utilizes wavelet transforms to decompose OCT images into low- and high-frequency components, enabling the model to extract both global structural features and fine-grained details. To improve lesion detection, we introduce a Multi-Scale Wavelet Spatial Attention (MSW-SA) module, which enhances the model's focus on regions of interest at multiple scales. Additionally, a High-Frequency Feature Compensation (HFFC) block is incorporated to recover edge information lost during wavelet decomposition, suppress noise, and preserve fine details crucial for lesion detection. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification accuracies of 97.82% and 99.58% on the OCT-C8 and OCT2017 datasets, respectively, surpassing existing methods. These results demonstrate the efficacy of WaveNet-SF in addressing the challenges of OCT image analysis and its potential as a powerful tool for retinal disease diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visualizing Spatial Point Clouds: A Task-Oriented Taxonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02651v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The visualization of 3D point cloud data is essential in fields such as autonomous navigation, environmental monitoring, and disaster response, where tasks like object recognition, structural analysis, and spatiotemporal exploration rely on clear and effective visual representation. Despite advancements in AI-driven processing, visualization remains a critical tool for interpreting complex spatial datasets. However, designing effective point cloud visualizations presents significant challenges due to the sparsity, density variations, and scale of the data. In this work, we analyze the design space of spatial point cloud visualization, highlighting a gap in systematically mapping visualization techniques to analytical objectives. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes four decades of visualization design choices, linking them to fundamental challenges in modern applications. By structuring visualization strategies based on data types, user objectives, and visualization techniques, our framework provides a foundation for advancing more effective, interpretable, and user-centered visualization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Function Vectors for Spatial Relations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02528v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads, termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational reasoning in LMMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[HRTFformer: A Spatially-Aware Transformer for Personalized HRTF Upsampling in Immersive Audio Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01891v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) are starting to be introduced in many commercial immersive audio applications and are crucial for realistic spatial audio rendering. However, one of the main hesitations regarding their introduction is that creating personalized HRTFs is impractical at scale due to the complexities of the HRTF measurement process. To mitigate this drawback, HRTF spatial upsampling has been proposed with the aim of reducing measurements required. While prior work has seen success with different machine learning (ML) approaches, these models often struggle with long-range spatial consistency and generalization at high upsampling factors. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture for HRTF upsampling, leveraging the attention mechanism to better capture spatial correlations across the HRTF sphere. Working in the spherical harmonic (SH) domain, our model learns to reconstruct high-resolution HRTFs from sparse input measurements with significantly improved accuracy. To enhance spatial coherence, we introduce a neighbor dissimilarity loss that promotes magnitude smoothness, yielding more realistic upsampling. We evaluate our method using both perceptual localization models and objective spectral distortion metrics. Experiments show that our model surpasses leading methods by a substantial margin in generating realistic, high-fidelity HRTFs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages and 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Like Playing a Video Game: Spatial-Temporal Optimization of Foot Trajectories for Controlled Football Kicking in Bipedal Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01843v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robot soccer presents several challenges, particularly in maintaining system stability during aggressive kicking motions while achieving precise ball trajectory control. Current solutions, whether traditional position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms, and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, conference paper</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Asynchronous Federated Modeling for Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01771v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial data are central to applications such as environmental monitoring and urban planning, but are often distributed across devices where privacy and communication constraints limit direct sharing. Federated modeling offers a practical solution that preserves data privacy while enabling global modeling across distributed data sources. For instance, environmental sensor networks are privacy- and bandwidth-constrained, motivating federated spatial modeling that shares only privacy-preserving summaries to produce timely, high-resolution pollution maps without centralizing raw data. However, existing federated modeling approaches either ignore spatial dependence or rely on synchronous updates that suffer from stragglers in heterogeneous environments. This work proposes an asynchronous federated modeling framework for spatial data based on low-rank Gaussian process approximations. The method employs block-wise optimization and introduces strategies for gradient correction, adaptive aggregation, and stabilized updates. We establish linear convergence with explicit dependence on staleness, a result of standalone theoretical significance. Moreover, numerical experiments demonstrate that the asynchronous algorithm achieves synchronous performance under balanced resource allocation and significantly outperforms it in heterogeneous settings, showcasing superior robustness and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Euclid's Gift: Enhancing Spatial Perception and Reasoning in Vision-Language Models via Geometric Surrogate Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24473v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family, inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench, VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them, RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenFLAME: A Federated Spatial Naming Infrastructure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04271v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial applications, i.e., applications that tie digital information with the physical world, have improved many of our daily activities, such as navigation and ride-sharing. This class of applications also holds significant promise of enabling new industries such as augmented reality and robotics. The development of these applications is enabled by a system that can resolve real-world locations to names, or a spatial naming system. Today, mapping platforms provided by organizations like Google and Apple serve as spatial naming systems. These maps are centralized and primarily cover outdoor spaces. We envision that future spatial applications, such as persistent world-scale augmented reality, would require detailed and precise spatial data across indoor and outdoor spaces. The scale of cartography efforts required to survey indoor spaces and their privacy needs inhibit existing centralized maps from incorporating such spaces into their platform. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of OpenFLAME stands for Open Federated Localization and Mapping Engine, a federated spatial naming system, or in other words, a federated mapping infrastructure. It enables independent parties to manage and serve their own maps of physical regions. This unlocks scalability of map management, isolation, and privacy of maps. The discovery system that identifies maps hosted at a given location is a primary component of our system. We implement OpenFLAME on top of the existing Domain Name System (DNS), which enables us to leverage its existing infrastructure. We implement map services such as address-to-location mapping, routing, and localization on top of our federated mapping infrastructure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparkle: Mastering Basic Spatial Capabilities in Vision Language Models Elicits Generalization to Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16162v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) perform well on many tasks but often fail at spatial reasoning, which is essential for navigation and interaction with physical environments. Many spatial reasoning tasks depend on fundamental two-dimensional (2D) skills, yet our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art VLMs give implausible or incorrect answers to composite spatial problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans solve effortlessly. To address this, we enhance 2D spatial reasoning in VLMs by training them only on basic spatial capabilities. We first disentangle 2D spatial reasoning into three core components: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. We hypothesize that mastering these skills substantially improves performance on complex spatial tasks that require advanced reasoning and combinatorial problem solving, while also generalizing to real-world scenarios. To test this, we introduce Sparkle, a framework that generates synthetic data to provide targeted supervision across these three capabilities and yields an instruction dataset for each. Experiments show that VLMs fine-tuned with \emph{Sparkle} improve not only on basic tasks but also on composite and out-of-distribution real-world spatial reasoning tasks. These results indicate that enhancing basic spatial skills through synthetic generalization effectively advances complex spatial reasoning and offers a systematic strategy for boosting the spatial understanding of VLMs. Source codes of Sparkle are available at https://github.com/YihongT/Sparkle.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounded GUI Understanding for Vision-Based Spatial Intelligent Agent: Exemplified by Extended Reality Apps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10811v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, spatial computing a.k.a. Extended Reality (XR) has emerged as a transformative technology, offering users immersive and interactive experiences across diversified virtual environments. Users can interact with XR apps through interactable GUI elements (IGEs) on the stereoscopic three-dimensional (3D) graphical user interface (GUI). The accurate recognition of these IGEs is instrumental, serving as the foundation of many software engineering tasks, including automated testing and effective GUI search. The most recent IGE detection approaches for 2D mobile apps typically train a supervised object detection model based on a large-scale manually-labeled GUI dataset, usually with a pre-defined set of clickable GUI element categories like buttons and spinners. Such approaches can hardly be applied to IGE detection in XR apps, due to a multitude of challenges including complexities posed by open-vocabulary and heterogeneous IGE categories, intricacies of context-sensitive interactability, and the necessities of precise spatial perception and visual-semantic alignment for accurate IGE detection results. Thus, it is necessary to embark on the IGE research tailored to XR apps. In this paper, we propose the first zero-shot cOntext-sensitive inteRactable GUI ElemeNT dEtection framework for virtual Reality apps, named Orienter. By imitating human behaviors, Orienter observes and understands the semantic contexts of XR app scenes first, before performing the detection. The detection process is iterated within a feedback-directed validation and reflection loop. Specifically, Orienter contains three components, including (1) Semantic context comprehension, (2) Reflection-directed IGE candidate detection, and (3) Context-sensitive interactability classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orienter is more effective than the state-of-the-art GUI element detection approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local aggregate multiscale processes: A scalable, machine-learning-compatible spatial model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00968v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study develops the Local Aggregate Multiscale Process (LAMP), a scalable and machine-learning-compatible alternative to conventional spatial Gaussian processes (GPs, or kriging). Unlike conventional covariance-based spatial models, LAMP represents spatial processes by a multiscale ensemble of local models, inspired by geographically weighted regression. To ensure stable model training, larger-scale patterns that are easier to learn are modeled first, followed by smaller-scale patterns, with training terminated once the validation score stops improving. The training procedure, which is based on holdout validation, is easily integrated with other machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forests and neural networks). LAMP training is computationally efficient as it avoids explicit matrix inversion, a major computational bottleneck in conventional GPs. Comparative Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that LAMP, as well as its integration with random forests, achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to an analysis of residential land prices in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Japan. The R code is available from available from https://github.com/dmuraka/spLAMP_dev_version/tree/main</p></details> |  |
| **[MoveGPT: Scaling Mobility Foundation Models with Spatially-Aware Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18670v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of foundation models in language has inspired a new wave of general-purpose models for human mobility. However, existing approaches struggle to scale effectively due to two fundamental limitations: a failure to use meaningful basic units to represent movement, and an inability to capture the vast diversity of patterns found in large-scale data. In this work, we develop MoveGPT, a large-scale foundation model specifically architected to overcome these barriers. MoveGPT is built upon two key innovations: (1) a unified location encoder that maps geographically disjoint locations into a shared semantic space, enabling pre-training on a global scale; and (2) a Spatially-Aware Mixture-of-Experts Transformer that develops specialized experts to efficiently capture diverse mobility patterns. Pre-trained on billion-scale datasets, MoveGPT establishes a new state-of-the-art across a wide range of downstream tasks, achieving performance gains of up to 35% on average. It also demonstrates strong generalization capabilities to unseen cities. Crucially, our work provides empirical evidence of scaling ability in human mobility, validating a clear path toward building increasingly capable foundation models in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Gaussian fields for complex areas with application to marine megafauna conservation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00611v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Gaussian fields (SGFs) are widely employed in modeling the distributions of marine megafauna, yet they traditionally rely on assumptions of isotropy and stationarity, conditions that often prove unrealistic in complex ecological environments featuring coastlines, islands, and depth gradients acting as partial movement barriers. Existing spatial models typically treat these barriers as either fully impermeable, completely blocking species movement and dispersal, or entirely absent, which inadequately represents most real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce the Transparent Barrier Model, an extension of spatial Gaussian fields that explicitly incorporates barriers with varying levels of permeability. The model assigns spatially varying range parameters to distinct barrier regions, allowing ecological and geographical knowledge about barrier permeability to directly inform model specifications. This approach maintains computational efficiency by utilizing the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) framework combined with stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), ensuring feasible application even in large, complex spatial domains.We demonstrate the practical utility and flexibility of the Transparent Barrier Model through its application to dugong (Dugong dugon) distribution data from the Red Sea.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Semantics: Rediscovering Spatial Awareness in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17349v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at identifying and describing objects but often fail at spatial reasoning. We study why VLMs, such as LLaVA, underutilize spatial cues despite having positional encodings and spatially rich vision encoder features. Our analysis reveals a key imbalance: vision token embeddings have much larger norms than text tokens, suppressing LLM's position embedding. To expose this mechanism, we developed three interpretability tools: (1) the Position Sensitivity Index, which quantifies reliance on token order, (2) the Cross Modality Balance, which reveals attention head allocation patterns, and (3) a RoPE Sensitivity probe, which measures dependence on rotary positional embeddings. These tools uncover that vision tokens and system prompts dominate attention. We validated our mechanistic understanding through targeted interventions that predictably restore positional sensitivity. These findings reveal previously unknown failure modes in multimodal attention and demonstrate how interpretability analysis can guide principled improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Diffusion Guidance for Spatial Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26489v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and guided-diffusion methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Spectral Binarized Neural Network for Panchromatic and Multi-spectral Images Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23321v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network (BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution (S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM) and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can attain a promising performance.</p></details> |  |

Yet, we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and generalizability of embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[OWL: Geometry-Aware Spatial Reasoning for Audio Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26140v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning is fundamental to auditory perception, yet current audio large language models (ALLMs) largely rely on unstructured binaural cues and single step inference. This limits both perceptual accuracy in direction and distance estimation and the capacity for interpretable reasoning. Recent work such as BAT demonstrates spatial QA with binaural audio, but its reliance on coarse categorical labels (left, right, up, down) and the absence of explicit geometric supervision constrain resolution and robustness. We introduce the $\textbf{Spatial-Acoustic Geometry Encoder (SAGE}$), a geometry-aware audio encoder that aligns binaural acoustic features with 3D spatial structure using panoramic depth images and room-impulse responses at training time, while requiring only audio at inference. Building on this representation, we present $\textbf{OWL}$, an ALLM that integrates $\textbf{SAGE}$ with a spatially grounded chain-of-thought to rationalize over direction-of-arrivals (DoA) and distance estimates. Through curriculum learning from perceptual QA to multi-step reasoning, $\textbf{OWL}$ supports o'clock-level azimuth and DoA estimation. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we construct and release $\textbf{BiDepth}$, a dataset of over one million QA pairs combining binaural audio with panoramic depth images and room impulse responses across both in-room and out-of-room scenarios. Across two benchmark datasets, our new $\textbf{BiDepth}$ and the public SpatialSoundQA, $\textbf{OWL}$ reduces mean DoA error by $\textbf{11$^{\circ}$}$ through $\textbf{SAGE}$ and improves spatial reasoning QA accuracy by up to $\textbf{25}$\% over BAT.</p></details> |  |

We prove that if the involved operators are domain-uniformly stabilizable and detectable, then these localized perturbations only have a local effect on the optimal solution. We characterize this domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability for the transport equation with constant transport velocity, showing that even for unitary semigroups, optimality implies exponential damping. We extend this result to the case of a space-dependent transport velocity. Finally we leverage the results for the transport equation to characterize domain-uniform stabilizability of the wave equation. Numerical examples in one space dimension complement the theoretical results.</p></details> | 53 pages, 5 figures |

To help overcome these limitations, we introduce iVISPAR, an interactive multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs acting as agents. \mbox{iVISPAR} is based on a variant of the sliding tile puzzle, a classic problem that demands logical planning, spatial awareness, and multi-step reasoning. The benchmark supports visual 3D, 2D, and text-based input modalities, enabling comprehensive assessments of VLMs' planning and reasoning skills. We evaluate a broad suite of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source VLMs, comparing their performance while also providing optimal path solutions and a human baseline to assess the task's complexity and feasibility for humans. Results indicate that while VLMs perform better on 2D tasks compared to 3D or text-based settings, they struggle with complex spatial configurations and consistently fall short of human performance, illustrating the persistent challenge of visual alignment. This underscores critical gaps in current VLM capabilities, highlighting their limitations in achieving human-level cognition. Project website: https://microcosm.ai/ivispar</p></details> |  |

We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zju-real.github.io/ViewSpatial-Page/</p></details> |
| **[S$^2$FS: Spatially-Aware Separability-Driven Feature Selection in Fuzzy Decision Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25841v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature selection is crucial for fuzzy decision systems (FDSs), as it identifies informative features and eliminates rule redundancy, thereby enhancing predictive performance and interpretability. Most existing methods either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability of the selected features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reasoning with Vision-Language Models in Ego-Centric Multi-View Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06266v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data. Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view environments.</p></details> |  |

Prior methods focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and model will be available at: https://github.com/chenshunpeng/SAGE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Spatial Heterogeneity in Exposure Buffers and Risk: A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25708v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Place-based epidemiology studies often rely on circular buffers to define "exposure" to spatially distributed risk factors, where the buffer radius represents a threshold beyond which exposure does not influence the outcome of interest. This approach is popular due to its simplicity and alignment with public health policies. However, buffer radii are often chosen relatively arbitrarily and assumed constant across the spatial domain. This may result in suboptimal statistical inference if these modeling choices are incorrect. To address this, we develop SVBR (Spatially-Varying Buffer Radii), a flexible hierarchical Bayesian spatial change points approach that treats buffer radii as unknown parameters and allows both radii and exposure effects to vary spatially. Through simulations, we find that SVBR improves estimation and inference for key model parameters compared to traditional methods. We also apply SVBR to study healthcare access in Madagascar, finding that proximity to healthcare facilities generally increases antenatal care usage, with clear spatial variation in this relationship. By relaxing rigid assumptions about buffer characteristics, our method offers a flexible, data-driven approach to accurately defining exposure and quantifying its impact. The newly developed methods are available in the R package EpiBuffer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series C</p></details> |

Introducing a spatially-varying delay into the model gives rise to a gain operator defined through integral equations which the operator's input -- the varying delay function -- enters in previously unencountered manners, including in the limits of integration and as the inverse of the `delayED time' function. This, in turn, introduces novel mathematical challenges in estimating the operator's Lipschitz constant. The backstepping kernel function having two branches endows the feedback law with a two-branch structure, where only one of the two feedback branches depends on both of the kernel branches. For this rich feedback structure, we propose a neural operator approximation of such a two-branch feedback law and prove the approximator to be semiglobally practically stabilizing. With numerical results we illustrate the training of the neural operator and its stabilizing capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This 14 page paper contains 1 table and 9 figures</p></details> |

However, many models often treat the brain as a network of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), neglecting finer spatial properties which can not only increase model complexity but also constrain observable neural dynamics. To address this limitation, we propose a spatially extended approach using partial differential equations (PDEs) for both the brain and body. As a case study, we revisit a previously developed model of a child swinging, now incorporating spatial dynamics. By considering the spatio-temporal properties of the brain and body, we analyze how input location and propagation along a PDE influence behavior. This approach offers new insights into the role of spatial organization in adaptive behavior, bridging the gap between abstract neural models and the physical constraints of embodied systems. Our results highlight the importance of spatial dynamics in understanding brain-body-environment interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, Artificial Life Conference 2025, selected for talk</p></details> |
| **[A General Theory of Emergent Linearity in Complex Dynamical Systems: The Role of Spatial Averaging and Vanishing Correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25589v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various natural and engineered systems, from urban traffic flow to the human brain, have been described by large-scale networked dynamical systems. Despite their vast differences, these systems are often similar in being comprised of numerous microscopic subsystems with complex nonlinear dynamics and interactions that give rise to diverse emergent macroscopic behaviors. As such, a long-standing question across various fields has been to understand why and how various forms of macroscopic behavior emerge from underlying microscopic dynamics. Motivated by a growing body of empirical observations, in this work we focus on linearity as one of the most fundamental aspects of system dynamics, and develop a general theoretical framework for the interplay between spatial averaging, decaying microscopic correlations, and emergent macroscopic linearity. Using and extending the theory of mixing sequences, we show that in a broad class of autonomous nonlinear networked systems, the dynamics of the average of all subsystems' states becomes asymptotically linear as the number of subsystems grows to infinity, provided that (in addition to technical assumptions) pairwise correlations between subsystems decay to 0 as their pairwise distance grows to infinity. We prove this result when the latter distance is between subsystems' linear indices or spatial locations, and provide extensions to linear time-invariant (LTI) limit dynamics, finite-sample analysis of rates of convergence, and networks of spatially-embedded subsystems with random locations. To our knowledge, this work is the first rigorous analysis of macroscopic linearity in large-scale heterogeneous networked systems, and provides a solid foundation for further theoretical and empirical analyses in various domains of science and engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25390v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking, the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation, rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37 state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding, and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs. We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space.

| **[Adapt or Regress: Rate-Memory-Compatible Spatially-Coupled Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21112v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that have excellent performance thanks to the degrees of freedom they offer. An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components, the number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In the same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed. For example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions and data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger codes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables switching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while reducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable SC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design probabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is achieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes memory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of short cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability distribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown distribution characterizing the additional components. We use the gradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of cycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to design any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other cases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC codes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts and remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a literature-based straightforward scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (double column), 4 figures, submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)</p></details> |
| **[VideoAnchor: Reinforcing Subspace-Structured Visual Cues for Coherent Visual-Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25151v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in vision-language alignment, yet they remain limited in visual-spatial reasoning. We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism: visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers. Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger visual grounding.

To address these issues, we propose SSR-ZSON, a spatial-semantic relative zero-shot object navigation method based on the TARE hierarchical exploration framework, integrating a viewpoint generation strategy balancing spatial coverage and semantic density with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism. The performance improvement of the proposed method is due to two key innovations. First, the viewpoint generation strategy prioritizes areas of high semantic density within traversable sub-regions to maximize spatial coverage and minimize invalid exploration. Second, coupled with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism, it assesses semantic associations to direct navigation toward high-value spaces, preventing local entrapment and ensuring efficient exploration. Deployed on hybrid Habitat-Gazebo simulations and physical platforms, SSR-ZSON achieves real-time operation and superior performance. On Matterport3D and Habitat-Matterport3D datasets, it improves the Success Rate(SR) by 18.5\% and 11.2\%, and the Success weighted by Path Length(SPL) by 0.181 and 0.140, respectively, over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional Awareness Transformer-based Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (SFTG) framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics. To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more generalizable and robust neural representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[InSpire: Vision-Language-Action Models with Intrinsic Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13888v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to map language instruction and visual observations to raw low-level actions, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold great promise for achieving general-purpose robotic systems. Despite their advancements, existing VLAs tend to spuriously correlate task-irrelevant visual features with actions, limiting their generalization capacity beyond the training data. To tackle this challenge, we propose Intrinsic Spatial Reasoning (InSpire), a simple yet effective approach that mitigates the adverse effects of spurious correlations by boosting the spatial reasoning ability of VLAs. Specifically, InSpire redirects the VLA's attention to task-relevant factors by prepending the question "In which direction is the [object] relative to the robot?" to the language instruction and aligning the answer "right/left/up/down/front/back/grasped" and predicted actions with ground-truth. Notably, InSpire can be used as a plugin to enhance existing autoregressive VLAs, requiring no extra training data or interaction with other large models. Extensive experimental results in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach.</p></details> |  |

While prior efforts often rely on explicit 3D inputs or specialized model architectures, we ask: can LMMs reason about 3D space using only structured 2D representations derived from perception? We introduce Struct2D, a perception-guided prompting framework that combines bird's-eye-view (BEV) images with object marks and object-centric metadata, optionally incorporating egocentric keyframes when needed. Using Struct2D, we conduct an in-depth zero-shot analysis of closed-source LMMs (e.g., GPT-o3) and find that they exhibit surprisingly strong spatial reasoning abilities when provided with structured 2D inputs, effectively handling tasks such as relative direction estimation and route planning. Building on these insights, we construct Struct2D-Set, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset with 200K fine-grained QA pairs across eight spatial reasoning categories, generated automatically from 3D indoor scenes. We fine-tune an open-source LMM (Qwen2.5VL) on Struct2D-Set, achieving competitive performance on multiple benchmarks, including 3D question answering, dense captioning, and object grounding. Our approach demonstrates that structured 2D inputs can effectively bridge perception and language reasoning in LMMs-without requiring explicit 3D representations as input. We will release both our code and dataset to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, code link: https://github.com/neu-vi/struct2d</p></details> |

This effect is even more pronounced when the coarse propagator uses a reduced spatial resolution. However, some combinations of spatial discretization and numerical time stepping nevertheless allow for Parareal to converge with monotonically decreasing errors. This raises the question how these configurations can be distinguished theoretically from those where the error initially increases, sometimes over many orders of magnitude. For linear problems, we prove a theorem that implies that the 2-norm of the Parareal iteration matrix is not a suitable tool to predict convergence for hyperbolic problems when spatial coarsening is used. We then show numerical results that suggest that the pseudo-spectral radius can reliably indicate if a given configuration of Parareal will show transient growth or monotonic convergence. For the studied examples, it also provides a good quantitative estimate of the convergence rate in the first few Parareal iterations.</p></details> |  |

Our framework employs spatial processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA, Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing</p></details> |

Learning to Manipulate Object States via Visual Spatial Progress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24129v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most robot manipulation focuses on changing the kinematic state of objects: picking, placing, opening, or rotating them. However, a wide range of real-world manipulation tasks involve a different class of object state change--such as mashing, spreading, or slicing--where the object's physical and visual state evolve progressively without necessarily changing its position. We present SPARTA, the first unified framework for the family of object state change manipulation tasks. Our key insight is that these tasks share a common structural pattern: they involve spatially-progressing, object-centric changes that can be represented as regions transitioning from an actionable to a transformed state. Building on this insight, SPARTA integrates spatially progressing object change segmentation maps, a visual skill to perceive actionable vs. transformed regions for specific object state change tasks, to generate a) structured policy observations that strip away appearance variability, and b) dense rewards that capture incremental progress over time. These are leveraged in two SPARTA policy variants: reinforcement learning for fine-grained control without demonstrations or simulation; and greedy control for fast, lightweight deployment. We validate SPARTA on a real robot for three challenging tasks across 10 diverse real-world objects, achieving significant improvements in training time and accuracy over sparse rewards and visual goal-conditioned baselines. Our results highlight progress-aware visual representations as a versatile foundation for the broader family of object state manipulation tasks.

In a large-scale evaluation of SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation: current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence (VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to 8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic simulation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing REC and REG datasets rely heavily on manual annotation, which is labor-intensive and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose ColLab, a collaborative spatial progressive data engine that enables fully automated REC and REG data generation without human supervision. Specifically, our method introduces a Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) strategy, which leverages the semantic understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to generate descriptions. Furthermore, we design a module termed Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to enhance spatial expressiveness among duplicate instances. Experiments demonstrate that ColLab significantly accelerates the annotation process of REC and REG while improving the quality and discriminability of the generated expressions. In addition to the core methodological contribution, our framework was partially adopted in the data generation pipeline of the ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge on Multimodal Reasoning, enriching the dataset with diverse and challenging samples that better reflect real-world reasoning demands.</p></details> |  |
| **[SIG-Chat: Spatial Intent-Guided Conversational Gesture Generation Involving How, When and Where](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23852v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accompanying actions and gestures in dialogue are often closely linked to interactions with the environment, such as looking toward the interlocutor or using gestures to point to the described target at appropriate moments. Speech and semantics guide the production of gestures by determining their timing (WHEN) and style (HOW), while the spatial locations of interactive objects dictate their directional execution (WHERE). Existing approaches either rely solely on descriptive language to generate motions or utilize audio to produce non-interactive gestures, thereby lacking the characterization of interactive timing and spatial intent. This significantly limits the applicability of conversational gesture generation, whether in robotics or in the fields of game and animation production. To address this gap, we present a full-stack solution. We first established a unique data collection method to simultaneously capture high-precision human motion and spatial intent. We then developed a generation model driven by audio, language, and spatial data, alongside dedicated metrics for evaluating interaction timing and spatial accuracy. Finally, we deployed the solution on a humanoid robot, enabling rich, context-aware physical interactions.</p></details> |  |

AI agents with the spatial planning ability can better adapt to various real-world applications, including robotic manipulation, automatic assembly, urban planning etc. Recent works have attempted to construct benchmarks for evaluating the spatial intelligence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Nevertheless, these benchmarks primarily focus on spatial reasoning based on typical Visual Question-Answering (VQA) forms, which suffers from the gap between abstract spatial understanding and concrete task execution. In this work, we take a step further to build a comprehensive benchmark called MineAnyBuild, aiming to evaluate the spatial planning ability of open-world AI agents in the Minecraft game. Specifically, MineAnyBuild requires an agent to generate executable architecture building plans based on the given multi-modal human instructions. It involves 4,000 curated spatial planning tasks and also provides a paradigm for infinitely expandable data collection by utilizing rich player-generated content. MineAnyBuild evaluates spatial planning through four core supporting dimensions: spatial understanding, spatial reasoning, creativity, and spatial commonsense. Based on MineAnyBuild, we perform a comprehensive evaluation for existing MLLM-based agents, revealing the severe limitations but enormous potential in their spatial planning abilities. We believe our MineAnyBuild will open new avenues for the evaluation of spatial intelligence and help promote further development for open-world AI agents capable of spatial planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> |

Although knowledge distillation and sparse attention mechanisms can improve efficiency, they often fall short of delivering the high segmentation accuracy necessary for complex tasks. Balancing model performance with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this work, we propose a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework, termed MSD-KMamba, which integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale self-distillation. The bidirectional spatial aware branch effectively captures long-range spatial context dependencies across brain regions, while also incorporating a powerful nonlinear feature extraction mechanism that further enhances the model's ability to learn complex and heterogeneous patterns. In addition, the proposed multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy strengthens hierarchical feature representations and improves the transfer of semantic information at different resolution levels. By jointly leveraging the bidirectional spatial perception branch and the multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy, our framework effectively mitigates the bottleneck of quadratic computational complexity in volumetric segmentation, while simultaneously addressing the limitation of insufficient global perception. Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy, robustness, and generalization, while maintaining high computational efficiency and favorable scalability. The source code of MSD-KMamba is publicly available at https://github.com/daimao-zhang/MSD-KMamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially Parallel All-optical Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23611v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All-optical neural networks (AONNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for ultrafast and energy-efficient computation. These networks typically consist of multiple serially connected layers between input and output layers--a configuration we term spatially series AONNs, with deep neural networks (DNNs) being the most prominent examples. However, such series architectures suffer from progressive signal degradation during information propagation and critically require additional nonlinearity designs to model complex relationships effectively. Here we propose a spatially parallel architecture for all-optical neural networks (SP-AONNs). Unlike series architecture that sequentially processes information through consecutively connected optical layers, SP-AONNs divide the input signal into identical copies fed simultaneously into separate optical layers. Through coherent interference between these parallel linear sub-networks, SP-AONNs inherently enable nonlinear computation without relying on active nonlinear components or iterative updates. We implemented a modular 4F optical system for SP-AONNs and evaluated its performance across multiple image classification benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that increasing the number of parallel sub-networks consistently enhances accuracy, improves noise robustness, and expands model expressivity. Our findings highlight spatial parallelism as a practical and scalable strategy for advancing the capabilities of optical neural computing.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

In this dataset, LLMs are provided with conditions such as 2D boundary, applied forces and supports, and must reason about the resulting optimal material distribution. The dataset includes a variety of tasks, ranging from filling in masked regions within partial structures to predicting complete material distributions. Solving these tasks requires understanding the flow of forces and the required material distribution under given constraints, without access to simulation tools or explicit physical models, challenging models to reason about structural stability and spatial organization. Our dataset targets the evaluation of spatial and physical reasoning abilities in 2D settings, offering a complementary perspective to traditional language and logic benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, fVDB can process datasets with much larger footprint and spatial resolution than prior works, while providing a competitive memory footprint on small inputs. To achieve this combination of versatility and performance, fVDB relies on a single novel VDB index grid acceleration structure paired with several key innovations including GPU accelerated sparse grid construction, convolution using tensorcores, fast ray tracing kernels using a Hierarchical Digital Differential Analyzer algorithm (HDDA), and jagged tensors. Our framework is fully integrated with PyTorch enabling interoperability with existing pipelines, and we demonstrate its effectiveness on a number of representative tasks such as large-scale point-cloud segmentation, high resolution 3D generative modeling, unbounded scale Neural Radiance Fields, and large-scale point cloud reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid progress in Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image (T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE), an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3% using only a single round of correction.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 Tables, 4 Figures, Under Reviewed</p></details> |

However, this focus on a single domain is inefficient at capturing global, holistic patterns and fails to explicitly model an image's frequency-domain characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Spectral Summarizer Fusion Network (S$^3$F-Net), a dual-branch framework that learns from both spatial and spectral representations simultaneously. The S$^3$F-Net performs a fusion of a deep spatial CNN with our proposed shallow spectral encoder, SpectraNet. SpectraNet features the proposed SpectralFilter layer, which leverages the Convolution Theorem by applying a bank of learnable filters directly to an image's full Fourier spectrum via a computation-efficient element-wise multiplication. This allows the SpectralFilter layer to attain a global receptive field instantaneously, with its output being distilled by a lightweight summarizer network. We evaluate S$^3$F-Net across four medical imaging datasets spanning different modalities to validate its efficacy and generalizability. Our framework consistently and significantly outperforms its strong spatial-only baseline in all cases, with accuracy improvements of up to 5.13%. With a powerful Bilinear Fusion, S$^3$F-Net achieves a SOTA competitive accuracy of 98.76% on the BRISC2025 dataset. Concatenation Fusion performs better on the texture-dominant Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset, achieving 93.11% accuracy, surpassing many top-performing, much deeper models. Our explainability analysis also reveals that the S$^3$F-Net learns to dynamically adjust its reliance on each branch based on the input pathology. These results verify that our dual-domain approach is a powerful and generalizable paradigm for medical image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (JBHI).

Moreover, as audio foundation models are typically trained on dry, single-channel audio clips, the inherent spatial nature of real-world sound scenes is overlooked and tasks involving sound localization ruled out. To address these limitations, we propose GRAM: a General-purpose Real-world Audio Model utilizing a multi-channel masked auto-encoder approach to efficiently learn spatial audio representations from high-quality simulated real-world scenes. To evaluate the performance of GRAM and other audio foundation models in real-world sound scenes, we release Nat-HEAR: A naturalistic version of the HEAR benchmark suite comprising a simulated real-world version, as well as two new sound localization tasks. We show that the performance of GRAM surpasses all state-of-the-art self-supervised audio foundation models and speech models on both HEAR and Nat-HEAR, while using only a fraction of the training data. GRAM also showcases state-of-the-art localization performance, surpassing even supervised sound localization approaches, and can be flexibly applied either to a two-channel, binaural sound format or a four-channel, Ambisonics format. Validating GRAM's performance on real-world sound recordings demonstrates robust transfer to real-world scenes. Taken together, GRAM presents a significant advancement towards robust, spatial audio foundation models for real-world applications.</p></details> | Still under review |

Current foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens. Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language, \textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+ 2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in zero-shot RIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 22 Figures, 11 Tables</p></details> |
| **[JanusVLN: Decoupling Semantics and Spatiality with Dual Implicit Memory for Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22548v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided, enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

Statistical surrogates or emulators can predict high-fidelity fields from cheap low-fidelity output. We propose a highly scalable Bayesian approach that can learn the joint non-Gaussian distribution and nonlinear dependence structure of nonstationary spatial fields at multiple fidelities from a small number of training samples. Our method is based on fidelity-aware autoregressive GPs with suitably chosen regularization-inducing priors. Exploiting conjugacy, the integrated likelihood is available in closed form, enabling efficient hyperparameter optimization via stochastic gradient descent. After training, the method also characterizes in closed form the distribution of higher-fidelity fields given lower-fidelity data. In our numerical comparisons, we show that our approach substantially outperforms existing methods and that it can be used to characterize and simulate high-fidelity fine-scale climate behavior based on output from coarse (low-fidelity) global circulation models.</p></details> | 30 pages, 8 figures |

However, traditional methods for creating these scenes rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference, spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes with realistic layouts.

While current practices attempt to address this by organizing these phases into hybrid batches, such solutions create an inefficient tradeoff that sacrifices either throughput or latency, leaving substantial GPU resources underutilized. We identify two key root causes: 1) the prefill phase suffers from suboptimal compute utilization due to wave quantization and attention bottlenecks. 2) hybrid batches disproportionately prioritize latency over throughput, resulting in wasted compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate the issues, we present Bullet, a novel spatial-temporal orchestration system that eliminates these inefficiencies through precise phase coordination. Bullet enables concurrent execution of prefill and decode phases, while dynamically provisioning GPU resources using real-time performance modeling. By integrating SLO-aware scheduling and adaptive resource allocation, Bullet maximizes utilization without compromising latency targets. Experimental evaluations on real-world workloads demonstrate that Bullet delivers 1.26x average throughput gains (up to 1.55x) over state-of-the-arts, while consistently meeting latency constraints.</p></details> |  |

To complete many common tasks, relevant objects are required to pass in and out of a robot's field of view. In these settings, spatial memory - the ability to remember the spatial composition of the scene - is an important competency. However, building such mechanisms into robot learning systems remains an open research problem. We introduce mindmap (Spatial Memory in Deep Feature Maps for 3D Action Policies), a 3D diffusion policy that generates robot trajectories based on a semantic 3D reconstruction of the environment. We show in simulation experiments that our approach is effective at solving tasks where state-of-the-art approaches without memory mechanisms struggle.

TAPTRv2 is a simple yet effective DETR-like point tracking framework that works fine in regular videos but tends to fail in long videos. TAPTRv3 improves TAPTRv2 by addressing its shortcomings in querying high-quality features from long videos, where the target tracking points normally undergo increasing variation over time. In TAPTRv3, we propose to utilize both spatial and temporal context to bring better feature querying along the spatial and temporal dimensions for more robust tracking in long videos. For better spatial feature querying, we identify that off-the-shelf attention mechanisms struggle with point-level tasks and present Context-aware Cross-Attention (CCA). CCA introduces spatial context into the attention mechanism to enhance the quality of attention scores when querying image features. For better temporal feature querying, we introduce Visibility-aware Long-Temporal Attention (VLTA), which conducts temporal attention over past frames while considering their corresponding visibilities. This effectively addresses the feature drifting problem in TAPTRv2 caused by its RNN-like long-term modeling. TAPTRv3 surpasses TAPTRv2 by a large margin on most of the challenging datasets and obtains state-of-the-art performance. Even when compared with methods trained on large-scale extra internal data, TAPTRv3 still demonstrates superiority.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Bias to Balance: Exploring and Mitigating Spatial Bias in LVLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21984v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE, introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more holistic visual understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reasoning in Foundation Models: Benchmarking Object-Centric Spatial Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21922v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models. While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs) have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models. Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL, LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, NeurIPS Workshop SpaVLE</p></details> |

In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE) network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames, a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5% for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[CubistMerge: Spatial-Preserving Token Merging For Diverse ViT Backbones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21764v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks. Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1 accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

While Transformer-based methods have become prevalent in online HD map construction, most existing approaches overlook the inherent spatial dependencies and semantic relationships among map elements, which constrains their accuracy and generalization capabilities. To address this, we propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that explicitly models both spatial relations and semantic priors to enhance online HD map construction. Specifically, we introduce a Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware relation encoder. Additionally, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. RelMap is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs 0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories. These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and reliability constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning GUI Grounding with Spatial Reasoning from Visual Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21552v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow 93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEIST: A Graph Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics and Proteomics Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11152v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics have become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and gene expression at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial-omics data, we have the promise of characterizing cells within their tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and intra-cellular transcriptional or protein counts. Proteomics offers a complementary view by directly measuring proteins, which are the primary effectors of cellular function and key therapeutic targets. However, existing models either ignore the spatial information or the complex genetic and proteomic programs within cells. Thus they cannot infer how cell internal regulation adapts to microenvironmental cues. Furthermore, these models often utilize fixed gene vocabularies, hindering their generalizability unseen genes. In this paper, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. HEIST models tissues as hierarchical graphs. The higher level graph is a spatial cell graph, and each cell in turn, is represented by its lower level gene co-expression network graph. HEIST achieves this by performing both intra-level and cross-level message passing to utilize the hierarchy in its embeddings and can thus generalize to novel datatypes including spatial proteomics without retraining. HEIST is pretrained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive and masked autoencoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST embeddings reveals spatially informed subpopulations missed by prior models. Downstream evaluations demonstrate generalizability to proteomics data and state-of-the-art performance in clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, and gene imputation across multiple technologies.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks, however, probe only single-image relations and thus fail to assess the multi-image spatial reasoning that real-world deployments demand. We introduce MMSI-Bench, a VQA benchmark dedicated to multi-image spatial intelligence. Six 3D-vision researchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging, unambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired with carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process. We conduct extensive experiments and thoroughly evaluate 34 open-source and proprietary MLLMs, observing a wide gap: the strongest open-source model attains roughly 30% accuracy and OpenAI's o3 reasoning model reaches 40%, while humans score 97%. These results underscore the challenging nature of MMSI-Bench and the substantial headroom for future research. Leveraging the annotated reasoning processes, we also provide an automated error analysis pipeline that diagnoses four dominant failure modes, including (1) grounding errors, (2) overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors, (3) situation-transformation reasoning errors, and (4) spatial-logic errors, offering valuable insights for advancing multi-image spatial intelligence.

However, conventional lightweighting methods often sacrifice critical capabilities, particularly spatial reasoning. This creates a trade-off between efficiency and performance. To address this challenge, our work reuses Register Tokens, which were introduced for artifact removal in Vision Transformers but subsequently discarded. We suppose that these tokens contain essential spatial information and propose RetoVLA, a novel architecture that reuses them directly by injecting them into the Action Expert. RetoVLA maintains a lightweight structure while leveraging this repurposed spatial context to enhance reasoning. We demonstrate RetoVLA's effectiveness through a series of comprehensive experiments. On our custom-built 7-DOF robot arm, the model achieves a 17.1%p absolute improvement in success rates for complex manipulation tasks. Our results confirm that reusing Register Tokens directly enhances spatial reasoning, demonstrating that what was previously discarded as an artifact is in fact a valuable, unexplored resource for robotic intelligence.

| **[Compositional-ARC: Assessing Systematic Generalization in Abstract Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01445v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Systematic generalization refers to the capacity to understand and generate novel combinations from known components. Despite recent progress by large language models (LLMs) across various domains, these models often fail to extend their knowledge to novel compositional scenarios, revealing notable limitations in systematic generalization. There has been an ongoing debate about whether neural networks possess the capacity for systematic generalization, with recent studies suggesting that meta-learning approaches designed for compositionality can significantly enhance this ability. However, these insights have largely been confined to linguistic problems, leaving their applicability to other tasks an open question. In this study, we extend meta-learning for compositionality to the domain of abstract spatial reasoning. To this end, we introduce $\textit{Compositional-ARC}-$a dataset designed to evaluate the capacity of models to systematically generalize from known geometric transformations (e.g., translation, rotation) of abstract two-dimensional objects to novel combinations of these transformations (e.g., translation+rotation). Our results show that a small transformer-based encoder-decoder model, trained via meta-learning for compositionality, can systematically generalize to previously unseen transformation compositions. Notably, despite having only 5.7M parameters, this model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs$-$including o3-mini, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, which fail to exhibit similar systematic behavior$-$and performs on par with the winning model of the ARC prize 2024, an 8B-parameter LLM trained via test-time training. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of meta-learning in promoting systematicity beyond linguistic tasks, suggesting a promising direction toward more robust and generalizable models.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |

Specifically, in terms of spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual fidelity and editability.

Accurate predictions are important for applications including motion planning, tracking, human-robot interaction, and safety monitoring. In this paper, we exploit Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), which encode spatial or spatio-temporal motion patterns as environment features, to achieve LHMP for horizons of up to 60 seconds. We propose an MoD-informed LHMP framework that supports various types of MoDs and includes a ranking method to output the most likely predicted trajectory, improving practical utility in robotics. Further, a time-conditioned MoD is introduced to capture motion patterns that vary across different times of day. We evaluate MoD-LHMP instantiated with three types of MoDs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that MoD-informed method outperforms learning-based ones, with up to 50\% improvement in average displacement error, and the time-conditioned variant achieves the highest accuracy overall.

The factor can be specified as spatially varying or spatially constant, and the scale parameter incorporates scientifically relevant covariates (e.g., longitude, latitude, altitude), enabling flexible representation of geographic heterogeneity. To avoid the computational burden of the full censored likelihood, we design a Gibbs sampler that embeds amortized neural posterior estimation within each parameter block, yielding scalable inference with full posterior uncertainty for parameters, predictive quantiles, and return levels. Simulation studies demonstrate that the approach improves MCMC mixing and estimation accuracy relative to baseline specifications, particularly when using moderately more complex network architectures, while preserving heavy-tail behavior. We illustrate the methodology with daily precipitation in Guanacaste, Costa Rica, evaluating a suite of nested models and selecting the best-performing factor combination via out-of-sample diagnostics. The chosen specification reveals coherent spatial patterns in multi-year return periods and provides actionable information for infrastructure planning and climate-risk management in a tropical dry region strongly influenced by climatic factors. The proposed Gibbs scheme generalizes to other settings where parameters can be partitioned into inferentially homogeneous blocks and conditionals learned via amortized, likelihood-free methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer for High-resolution Land Subsidence Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25393v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT), a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing for reviewing</p></details> |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from exogenous stochastic processes. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |
| **[UrbanGraph: Physics-Informed Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Heterogeneous Graphs for Urban Microclimate Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00457v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical, as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this, we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. It encodes key physical processes -- vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0% over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and 7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[STaR-Attack: A Spatio-Temporal and Narrative Reasoning Attack Framework for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26473v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically, our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability. STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates, forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety alignments in UMMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories under Spatio-Temporal Vector Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26005v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a formal active learning methodology for guiding the placement of Lagrangian observers to infer time-dependent vector fields -- a key task in oceanography, marine science, and ocean engineering -- using a physics-informed spatio-temporal Gaussian process surrogate model. The majority of existing placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Behavioural Classification in C. elegans: a Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00086v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 1mm roundworm C. elegans is a model organism used in many sub-areas of biology to investigate different types of biological processes. In order to complement the n-vivo analysis with computer-based investigations, several methods have been proposed to simulate the worm behaviour. These methods extract discrete behavioural units from the flow of the worm movements using different types of tracking techniques. Nevertheless, these techniques require a clear view of the entire worm body, which is not always achievable. For example, this happens in high density worm conditions, which are particularly informative to understand the influence of the social context on the single worm behaviour. In this paper, we illustrate and evaluate a method to extract behavioural units from recordings of C. elegans movements which do not necessarily require a clear view of the entire worm body. Moreover, the behavioural units are defined by an unsupervised automatic pipeline which frees the process from predefined assumptions that inevitably bias the behavioural analysis. The behavioural units resulting from the automatic method are interpreted by comparing them with hand-designed behavioural units. The effectiveness of the automatic method is evaluated by measuring the extent to which the movement of a simulated worm, with an agent-based model, matches the movement of a natural worm. Our results indicate that spatio-temporal locomotory patterns emerge even from single point worm tracking. Moreover, we show that such patterns represent a fundamental aspect of the behavioural classification process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23447v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS), the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However, a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network (HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1) spectral encoder module; 2) spatial encoder module; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter encoder module; 4) CR adapter decoder module; 5) spatial decoder module; and 6) spectral decoder module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on three HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models, surpassing the state of the art by up to 2.36 dB in terms of PSNR. Based on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal-Network Point Processes for Modeling Crime Events with Landmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10882v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-exciting point processes are widely used to model the contagious effects of crime events living within continuous geographic space, using their occurrence time and locations. However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |

Traditional spot trading suffers from negotiation delays and high energy costs, while conventional futures trading struggles to adapt to the dynamic, uncertain UAV-edge environment. To address these challenges, we propose PAST (pilot-and-adaptive stable trading), a novel framework for edge-assisted UAV networks with spatio-temporal dynamism. PAST integrates two complementary mechanisms: PilotAO (pilot trading agreements with overbooking), a risk-aware, overbooking-enabled early-stage decision-making module that establishes long-term, mutually beneficial agreements and boosts resource utilization; and AdaptAO (adaptive trading agreements with overbooking rate update), an intelligent adaptation module that dynamically updates agreements and overbooking rates based on UAV mobility, supply-demand variations, and agreement performance. Together, these mechanisms enable both stability and flexibility, guaranteeing individual rationality, strong stability, competitive equilibrium, and weak Pareto optimality. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that PAST consistently outperforms benchmark methods in decision-making overhead, task completion latency, resource utilization, and social welfare. By combining predictive planning with real-time adjustments, PAST offers a valuable reference on robust and adaptive practice for improving low-altitude mission performance.</p></details> |  |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

This sole focus on efficacy has steered development of large-scale models that require massive resources, and results in considerable carbon footprint across the model life-cycle. In this work, we explore how physics inductive biases can offer useful trade-offs between model efficacy and model efficiency (compute, energy, and carbon). We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for spatio-temporal forecasting. Our experiments show that incorporating physics inductive biases offer a principled way to improve the efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of machine learning models. We argue that model efficiency, along with model efficacy, should become a core consideration driving machine learning model development and deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code available at https://github.com/sophiawilson18/FlowMatching</p></details> |

| **[Spatio-temporal, multi-field deep learning of shock propagation in meso-structured media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16139v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to predict how shock waves traverse porous and architected materials is a key challenge in planetary defense and in the pursuit of inertial fusion energy. Yet capturing pore collapse, anomalous Hugoniot responses, and localized heating-phenomena that strongly influence asteroid deflection or fusion ignition has remained a major challenge despite recent advances in single-field and reduced representations. We introduce a multi-field spatio-temporal deep learning model (MSTM) that unifies seven coupled fields-pressure, density, temperature, energy, material distribution, and two velocity components into a single autoregressive surrogate. Trained on high-fidelity hydrocode data, MSTM captures nonlinear shock-driven dynamics across porous and architected configurations, achieving mean errors of 1.4% and 3.2% respectively, all while delivering over three orders of magnitude in speedup. This advance transforms problems once considered intractable into tractable design studies, establishing a practical framework for optimizing meso-structured materials in planetary impact mitigation and inertial fusion energy.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |
| **[ASTGI: Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interactions for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23313v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework. Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points. Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph for Robot Perception and Teleoperation Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23107v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teleoperation via natural-language reduces operator workload and enhances safety in high-risk or remote settings. However, in dynamic remote scenes, transmission latency during bidirectional communication creates gaps between remote perceived states and operator intent, leading to command misunderstanding and incorrect execution. To mitigate this, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph (ST-OVSG), a representation that enriches open-vocabulary perception with temporal dynamics and lightweight latency annotations. ST-OVSG leverages LVLMs to construct open-vocabulary 3D object representations, and extends them into the temporal domain via Hungarian assignment with our temporal matching cost, yielding a unified spatio-temporal scene graph. A latency tag is embedded to enable LVLM planners to retrospectively query past scene states, thereby resolving local-remote state mismatches caused by transmission delays. To further reduce redundancy and highlight task-relevant cues, we propose a task-oriented subgraph filtering strategy that produces compact inputs for the planner. ST-OVSG generalizes to novel categories and enhances planning robustness against transmission latency without requiring fine-tuning. Experiments show that our method achieves 74 percent node accuracy on the Replica benchmark, outperforming ConceptGraph. Notably, in the latency-robustness experiment, the LVLM planner assisted by ST-OVSG achieved a planning success rate of 70.5 percent.</p></details> |  |
| **[PSTTS: A Plug-and-Play Token Selector for Efficient Event-based Spatio-temporal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22481v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba, and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements. Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3% on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be available.</p></details> |  |

While earlier approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in this critical domain.</p></details> |  |

However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</p></details> |  |

In Ireland's highly variable maritime climate, where ground-based measurement stations are sparsely distributed, selecting an appropriate solar irradiance dataset presents a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling framework for predicting solar irradiance at hourly and sub-hourly (10-minute) resolutions across Ireland. Cross-validation demonstrates that our model is statistically robust across all temporal resolutions with hourly showing highest prediction precision whereas 10-minute resolution encounters higher errors but better uncertainty quantification. In separate evaluations, we compare our model against alternative data sources, including reanalysis datasets and nearest-station interpolation, and find that it consistently provides superior site-specific accuracy. At the hourly scale, our model outperforms ERA5 in agreement with ground-based observations. At the sub-hourly scale, 10-minute resolution estimates provide solar PV power outputs consistent with residential and industrial solar PV installations in Ireland. Beyond surpassing existing datasets, our model delivers full uncertainty quantification, scalability and the capacity for real-time implementation, offering a powerful tool for solar energy prediction and the estimation of losses due to overload clipping from inverter undersizing.</p></details> |  |

The physical layer maps the geographic movement of individuals, while the information layer tracks the spread of knowledge and health behavior via social interactions. We explore the interplay between physical mobility, information flow, and epidemic outcomes by simulating disease spread within this dual-structured network. Our model employs stochastic elements to mirror human behavior, mobility, and information dissemination uncertainties. Through simulations, we assess the impact of network structure, mobility patterns, and information spread speed on epidemic dynamics. The findings highlight the crucial role of effective communication in curbing disease transmission, even in highly mobile societies. Additionally, our agent-based simulation allows for real-time scenario analysis through a user interface, offering insights into leveraging physical and informational networks for epidemic control. This research sheds light on designing strategic interventions in complex social systems to manage disease outbreaks.</p></details> |  |

Production systems typically rely on tabular gradient-boosted decision trees (e.g., XGBoost) that score sessions independently, overlooking the relational and temporal structure of online activity that characterizes coordinated attacks and "fraud rings." We introduce ATLAS (Account Takeover Learning Across Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph), a framework that reformulates ATO detection as spatio-temporal node classification on a time-respecting directed session graph. ATLAS links entities via shared identifiers (account, device, IP) and regulates connectivity with time-window and recency constraints, enabling causal, time-respecting message passing and latency-aware label propagation that uses only labels available at scoring time, non-anticipative and leakage-free. We operationalize ATLAS with inductive GraphSAGE variants trained via neighbor sampling, at scale on a sessions graph with more than 100M nodes and around 1B edges. On a high-risk digital product at Capital One, ATLAS delivers 6.38 percent AUC improvement and more than 50 percent reduction in customer friction, improving fraud capture while reducing user friction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at NeurIPS 2025 workshop New Perspective in Graph Machine Learning (NPGML)</p></details> |

Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation to the 2025 IEEE Global Communications Conference (IEEE GLOBECOM)</p></details> |

Efficient compression and representation are crucial for analyzing complex motion dynamics. In this work, we introduce an adversarially-refined VQ-GAN framework with dense motion tokenization for compressing spatio-temporal heatmaps while preserving the fine-grained traces of human motion. Our approach combines dense motion tokenization with adversarial refinement, which eliminates reconstruction artifacts like motion smearing and temporal misalignment observed in non-adversarial baselines. Our experiments on the CMU Panoptic dataset provide conclusive evidence of our method's superiority, outperforming the dVAE baseline by 9.31% SSIM and reducing temporal instability by 37.1%. Furthermore, our dense tokenization strategy enables a novel analysis of motion complexity, revealing that 2D motion can be optimally represented with a compact 128-token vocabulary, while 3D motion's complexity demands a much larger 1024-token codebook for faithful reconstruction. These results establish practical deployment feasibility across diverse motion analysis applications.

| **[GSTM-HMU: Generative Spatio-Temporal Modeling for Human Mobility Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19135v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility traces, often recorded as sequences of check-ins, provide a unique window into both short-term visiting patterns and persistent lifestyle regularities. In this work we introduce GSTM-HMU, a generative spatio-temporal framework designed to advance mobility analysis by explicitly modeling the semantic and temporal complexity of human movement. The framework consists of four key innovations. First, a Spatio-Temporal Concept Encoder (STCE) integrates geographic location, POI category semantics, and periodic temporal rhythms into unified vector representations. Second, a Cognitive Trajectory Memory (CTM) adaptively filters historical visits, emphasizing recent and behaviorally salient events in order to capture user intent more effectively. Third, a Lifestyle Concept Bank (LCB) contributes structured human preference cues, such as activity types and lifestyle patterns, to enhance interpretability and personalization. Finally, task-oriented generative heads transform the learned representations into predictions for multiple downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely used real-world datasets, including Gowalla, WeePlace, Brightkite, and FourSquare, and evaluate performance on three benchmark tasks: next-location prediction, trajectory-user identification, and time estimation. The results demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements over strong baselines, confirming the effectiveness of GSTM-HMU in extracting semantic regularities from complex mobility data. Beyond raw performance gains, our findings also suggest that generative modeling provides a promising foundation for building more robust, interpretable, and generalizable systems for human mobility intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches, including spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs), often face high memory demands and struggle to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies, limiting their efficiency in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce DynSTG-Mamba (Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Mamba), a novel framework that combines DF-STGNN and STG-Mamba to enhance motion sequence modeling. The DF-STGNN incorporates a dynamic spatio-temporal filter that adaptively adjusts spatial connections between skeletal joints and temporal interactions across different movement phases. This approach ensures better feature propagation through dynamic graph structures by considering the hierarchical nature and dynamics of skeletal gait data. Meanwhile, STG-Mamba, an extension of Mamba adapted for skeletal motion data, ensures a continuous propagation of states, facilitating the capture of long-term dependencies while reducing computational complexity. To reduce the number of model parameters and computational costs while maintaining consistency, we propose Cross-Graph Relational Knowledge Distillation, a novel knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns relational information between teacher (large architecture) and student models (small architecture) while using shared memory. This ensures that the interactions and movement patterns of the joints are accurately preserved in the motion sequences. We validate our DynSTG-Mamba on KOA-NM, PD-WALK, and ATAXIA datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and Recall. Our results highlight the efficiency and robustness of our approach, offering a lightweight yet highly accurate solution for automated gait analysis and movement disorder assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>After...</summary><p>After receiving detailed feedback from journalreviewers, we identified limitations in the initial approach and substantially improved the methodology and contributions of the work.

| **[Deformable Dynamic Convolution for Accurate yet Efficient Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11550v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is a critical component of intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion mitigation and accident risk prediction. While recent research has explored both graph-based and grid-based approaches, key limitations remain. Graph-based methods effectively capture non-Euclidean spatial structures but often incur high computational overhead, limiting their practicality in large-scale systems. In contrast, grid-based methods, which primarily leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offer greater computational efficiency but struggle to model irregular spatial patterns due to the fixed shape of their filters. Moreover, both approaches often fail to account for inherent spatio-temporal heterogeneity, as they typically apply a shared set of parameters across diverse regions and time periods. To address these challenges, we propose the Deformable Dynamic Convolutional Network (DDCN), a novel CNN-based architecture that integrates both deformable and dynamic convolution operations. The deformable layer introduces learnable offsets to create flexible receptive fields that better align with spatial irregularities, while the dynamic layer generates region-specific filters, allowing the model to adapt to varying spatio-temporal traffic patterns. By combining these two components, DDCN effectively captures both non-Euclidean spatial structures and spatio-temporal heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that DDCN achieves competitive predictive performance while significantly reducing computational costs, underscoring its potential for large-scale and real-time deployment.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

It employs an online data quality monitoring (DQM) system to promptly spot and diagnose particle data acquisition problems to avoid data quality loss. In this study, we present a semi-supervised spatio-temporal anomaly detection (AD) monitoring system for the physics particle reading channels of the Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) of the CMS using three-dimensional digi-occupancy map data of the DQM. We propose the GraphSTAD system, which employs convolutional and graph neural networks to learn local spatial characteristics induced by particles traversing the detector and the global behavior owing to shared backend circuit connections and housing boxes of the channels, respectively. Recurrent neural networks capture the temporal evolution of the extracted spatial features. We validate the accuracy of the proposed AD system in capturing diverse channel fault types using the LHC collision data sets. The GraphSTAD system achieves production-level accuracy and is being integrated into the CMS core production system for real-time monitoring of the HCAL. We provide a quantitative performance comparison with alternative benchmark models to demonstrate the promising leverage of the presented system.

| **[Spatio-temporal Dynamical Indices for Complex Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10069v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex systems span multiple spatial and temporal scales, making their dynamics challenging to understand and predict. This challenge is especially daunting when one wants to study localized and/or rare events. Advances in dynamical systems theory, including the development of state-dependent dynamical indices, namely local dimension and persistence, have provided powerful tools for studying these phenomena. However, existing applications of such indices rely on a predefined and fixed spatial domain, that provides a single scalar quantity for the entire region of interest. This aspect prevents understanding the spatially localized dynamical behavior of the system. In this work, we introduce Spatio-temporal Dynamical Indices (SDIs), that leverage the existing framework of state-dependent local dimension and persistence. SDIs are obtained via a sliding window approach, enabling the exploration of space-dependent properties in spatio-temporal data. As an example, we show that, through this framework, we are able to reconcile previously different perspectives on European summertime heatwaves. This result showcases the importance of accounting for spatial scales when performing scale-dependent dynamical analyses.</p></details> |  |
| **[StFT: Spatio-temporal Fourier Transformer for Long-term Dynamics Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11899v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating the long-term dynamics of multi-scale and multi-physics systems poses a significant challenge in understanding complex phenomena across science and engineering. The complexity arises from the intricate interactions between scales and the interplay of diverse physical processes, which manifest in PDEs through coupled, nonlinear terms that govern the evolution of multiple physical fields across scales. Neural operators have shown potential in short-term prediction of such complex spatio-temporal dynamics; however, achieving stable high-fidelity predictions and providing robust uncertainty quantification over extended time horizons remains an open and unsolved area of research. These limitations often lead to stability degradation with rapid error accumulation, particularly in long-term forecasting of systems characterized by multi-scale behaviors involving dynamics of different orders. To address these challenges, we propose an autoregressive Spatio-temporal Fourier Transformer (StFT), in which each transformer block is designed to learn the system dynamics at a distinct scale through a dual-path architecture that integrates frequency-domain and spatio-temporal representations. By leveraging a structured hierarchy of \ours blocks, the resulting model explicitly captures the underlying dynamics across both macro- and micro- spatial scales. Furthermore, a generative residual correction mechanism is introduced to learn a probabilistic refinement temporally while simultaneously quantifying prediction uncertainties, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of long-term probabilistic forecasting. Evaluations conducted on three benchmark datasets (plasma, fluid, and atmospheric dynamics) demonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art ML methods.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Unleashing the Potential of Multimodal LLMs for Zero-Shot Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15178v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal tube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot solution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to dynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \textit{grounding tokens}, for grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal grounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query (\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and temporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token predictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and temporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods on three common STVG benchmarks. The code will be available at https://github.com/zaiquanyang/LLaVA_Next_STVG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian inference for spatio-temporal hidden Markov models using the exchange algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15164v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal hidden Markov models are extremely difficult to estimate because their latent joint distributions are available only in trivial cases. In the estimation phase, these latent distributions are usually substituted with pseudo-distributions, which could affect the estimation results, in particular in the presence of strong dependence between the latent variables. In this work, we propose a spatio-temporal hidden Markov model where the latent process is an extension of the autologistic model. We show how inference can be carried out in a Bayesian framework using an approximate exchange algorithm, which circumvents the impractical calculations of the normalizing constants that arise in the model. Our proposed method leads to a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler that targets the correct posterior distribution of the model and not a pseudo-posterior. In addition, we develop a new initialization approach for the approximate exchange method, reducing the computational time of the algorithm. An extensive simulation study shows that the approximate exchange algorithm generally outperforms the pseudo-distribution approach, yielding more accurate parameter estimates. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to a real-world case study analyzing rainfall levels across Italian regions over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Marginals: Learning Joint Spatio-Temporal Patterns for Multivariate Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15033v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we aim to improve multivariate anomaly detection (AD) by modeling the \textit{time-varying non-linear spatio-temporal correlations} found in multivariate time series data . In multivariate time series data, an anomaly may be indicated by the simultaneous deviation of interrelated time series from their expected collective behavior, even when no individual time series exhibits a clearly abnormal pattern on its own. In many existing approaches, time series variables are assumed to be (conditionally) independent, which oversimplifies real-world interactions. Our approach addresses this by modeling joint dependencies in the latent space and decoupling the modeling of \textit{marginal distributions, temporal dynamics, and inter-variable dependencies}. We use a transformer encoder to capture temporal patterns, and to model spatial (inter-variable) dependencies, we fit a multi-variate likelihood and a copula. The temporal and the spatial components are trained jointly in a latent space using a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to learn meaningful feature representations to separate normal and anomaly samples.</p></details> |  |

However, forecasting future deformation from sparse Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series data remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework that transforms these sparse point measurements into a dense spatio-temporal tensor. This methodological shift allows, for the first time, the direct application of advanced computer vision architectures to this forecasting problem. We design and implement a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, specifically engineered to simultaneously learn spatial patterns and temporal dependencies from the generated data tensor. The model's performance is benchmarked against powerful machine learning baselines, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and LASSO regression, using Sentinel-1 data from eastern Ireland. Results demonstrate that the proposed architecture provides significantly more accurate and spatially coherent forecasts, establishing a new performance benchmark for this task. Furthermore, an interpretability analysis reveals that baseline models often default to simplistic persistence patterns, highlighting the necessity of our integrated spatio-temporal approach to capture the complex dynamics of ground deformation.

In recent research, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising method, but their intrinsic design, tailored primarily for sequential token processing, introduces notable challenges in effectively capturing spatial dependencies. Specifically, the inherent limitations of LLMs in modeling spatial relationships and their architectural incompatibility with graph-structured spatial data remain largely unaddressed. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ST-LINK, a novel framework that enhances the capability of Large Language Models to capture spatio-temporal dependencies. Its key components are Spatially-Enhanced Attention (SE-Attention) and the Memory Retrieval Feed-Forward Network (MRFFN). SE-Attention extends rotary position embeddings to integrate spatial correlations as direct rotational transformations within the attention mechanism. This approach maximizes spatial learning while preserving the LLM's inherent sequential processing structure. Meanwhile, MRFFN dynamically retrieves and utilizes key historical patterns to capture complex temporal dependencies and improve the stability of long-term forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-LINK surpasses conventional deep learning and LLM approaches, and effectively captures both regular traffic patterns and abrupt changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, Accepted to CIKM 2025.

| **[AdaSTI: Conditional Diffusion Models with Adaptive Dependency Modeling for Spatio-Temporal Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18144v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal data abounds in domain like traffic and environmental monitoring. However, it often suffers from missing values due to sensor malfunctions, transmission failures, etc. Recent years have seen continued efforts to improve spatio-temporal data imputation performance. Recently diffusion models have outperformed other approaches in various tasks, including spatio-temporal imputation, showing competitive performance. Extracting and utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies as conditional information is vital in diffusion-based methods. However, previous methods introduce error accumulation in this process and ignore the variability of the dependencies in the noisy data at different diffusion steps. In this paper, we propose AdaSTI (Adaptive Dependency Model in Diffusion-based Spatio-Temporal Imputation), a novel spatio-temporal imputation approach based on conditional diffusion model. Inside AdaSTI, we propose a BiS4PI network based on a bi-directional S4 model for pre-imputation with the imputed result used to extract conditional information by our designed Spatio-Temporal Conditionalizer (STC)network. We also propose a Noise-Aware Spatio-Temporal (NAST) network with a gated attention mechanism to capture the variant dependencies across diffusion steps. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that AdaSTI outperforms existing methods in all the settings, with up to 46.4% reduction in imputation error.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Building on these developments, we introduce the identifiable autoregressive variational autoencoder, which ensures the identifiability of latent components consisting of nonstationary autoregressive processes. The blind source separation efficacy of the proposed method is showcased through a simulation study, where it is compared against state-of-the-art methods, and the spatio-temporal prediction performance is evaluated against several competitors on air pollution and weather datasets.</p></details> |  |

Based on the EEG signals from four frontal lobe channels, the network aims to generate virtual channel EEG signals for other 13 important brain regions. The architecture of the network is a two-dimensional convolutional neural network and it includes a parallel module for temporal and spatial domain feature extraction, followed by a feature fusion module. The public PRED+CT database, which includes multi-channel EEG signals from 119 subjects, was selected to verify the constructed network. The results showed that the average correlation coefficient between the generated virtual channel EEG signals and the original real signals was 0.6724, with an average absolute error of 3.9470. Furthermore, the 13 virtual channel EEG signals were combined with the original EEG signals of four brain regions and then used for anxiety classification with a support vector machine. The results indicate that the virtual EEG signals generated by the constructed network not only have a high degree of consistency with the real channel EEG signals but also significantly enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms for anxiety classification. This study effectively alleviates the problem of insufficient information acquisition by portable EEG devices with few channels.</p></details> |  |

Nutrient stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment. Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral, and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data, document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low, medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies. We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop management and improved plant health.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 7 Tables</p></details> |

Many research works, including Potential Outcome Model and Structural Causal Model, have been proposed to realize it. However, their modelings, theoretical foundations and application approaches are usually different. Moreover, there is a lack of graphical approach to infer spatio-temporal counterfactuals, that considers spatial and temporal interactions between multiple units. Thus, in this work, our aim is to investigate a survey to compare and discuss different counterfactual models, theories and approaches, and further build a unified graphical causal frameworks to infer the spatio-temporal counterfactuals.</p></details> | in press |
| **[Mechanistic Learning with Guided Diffusion Models to Predict Spatio-Temporal Brain Tumor Growth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09610v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time predictions that account for mechanistic priors.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[A Zero-Inflated Spatio-Temporal Model for Integrating Fishery-Dependent and Independent Data under Preferential Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09336v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sustainable management of marine ecosystems is vital for maintaining healthy fishery resources, and benefits from advanced scientific tools to accurately assess species distribution patterns. In fisheries science, two primary data sources are used: fishery-independent data (FID), collected through systematic surveys, and fishery-dependent data (FDD), obtained from commercial fishing activities. While these sources provide complementary information, their distinct sampling schemes - systematic for FID and preferential for FDD - pose significant integration challenges. This study introduces a novel spatio-temporal model that integrates FID and FDD, addressing challenges associated with zero-inflation and preferential sampling (PS) common in ecological data. The model employs a six-layer structure to differentiate between presence-absence and biomass observations, offering a robust framework for ecological studies affected by PS biases. Simulation results demonstrate the model's accuracy in parameter estimation across diverse PS scenarios and its ability to detect preferential signals. Application to the study of the distribution patterns of the European sardine populations along the southern Portuguese continental shelf illustrates the model's effectiveness in integrating diverse data sources and incorporating environmental and vessel-specific covariates. The model reveals spatio-temporal variability in sardine presence and biomass, providing actionable insights for fisheries management. Beyond ecology, this framework offers broad applicability to data integration challenges in other disciplines.</p></details> |  |

While spatio-temporal graph (STG) models are a leading paradigm for such data, they often fall short in dynamic, human-centric environments due to two fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on static graph topologies, which fail to capture physical, event-driven dynamics, and (2) their tendency to confuse spurious correlations with true causality, undermining robustness in human-centric environments. To address these gaps, we propose the Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (DyC-STG), a novel framework designed for real-time data credibility analysis in IoT. Our framework features two synergistic contributions: an event-driven dynamic graph module that adapts the graph topology in real-time to reflect physical state changes, and a causal reasoning module to distill causally-aware representations by strictly enforcing temporal precedence. To facilitate the research in this domain we release two new real-world datasets. Comprehensive experiments show that DyC-STG establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving an F1-Score of up to 0.930.</p></details> |  |

Functional testing detects SDE-related faults but is expensive to simulate. We present a unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) for fast, accurate prediction of long-cycle fault impact probabilities (FIPs) in large sequential circuits, supporting quantitative risk assessment. Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to capture topology and signal timing; dedicated spatial and temporal encoders predict multi-cycle FIPs efficiently. On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). The framework accepts features from testability metrics or fault simulation, allowing efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. A test-point selection study shows that choosing observation points by predicted FIPs improves detection of long-cycle, hard-to-detect faults. The approach scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization and fits downstream electronic design automation flows.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, plan to submit to ACM TODAES</p></details> |

Traditional input modalities, such as Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements. Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network (MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI, comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures (VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety of applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the precise and efficient decoding of MI remains challenging due to their non-stationary nature and low signal-to-noise ratio. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end deep learning framework of Discriminative Residual Dense Convolutional Autoencoder with Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (DRDCAE-STGNN) to enhance the MI feature learning and classification. Specifically, the DRDCAE module leverages residual-dense connections to learn discriminative latent representations through joint reconstruction and classifica-tion, while the STGNN module captures dynamic spatial dependencies via a learnable graph adjacency matrix and models temporal dynamics using bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM). Extensive evaluations on BCI Competition IV 2a, 2b, and PhysioNet datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 95.42%, 97.51%, and 90.15%, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component, and interpreta-bility analysis reveals neurophysiologically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, despite its complexity, the model maintains a feasible parameter count and an inference time of 0.32 ms per sample. These results indicate that our method offers a robust, accurate, and interpretable solution for MI-EEG decoding, with strong generalizability across subjects and tasks and meeting the requirements for potential real-time BCI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to IEEE Journal</p></details> |
| **[Select, then Balance: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Exogenous-Aware Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05779v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting aims to predict the future state of dynamic systems and plays an important role in multiple fields. However, existing solutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target variables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into the model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to promote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two challenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the target system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and future variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \model, a novel framework for modeling \underline{exo}genous variables in \underline{s}patio-\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select, then balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated expert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent space to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized sub-experts. Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which recomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs are integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic balance during the modeling process. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency of our proposed framework.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

To address key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro) contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling spatial dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures, under review for journal publication</p></details> |

Specifically, we model the observations by two weakly time-stationary point processes with spatial intensity measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ over the expanding window $(0,t]$ as $t$ increases to infinity, and establish sharp convergence rates of the empirical UOT in terms of the intrinsic dimensions of the measures. We assume a sub-quadratic temporal growth condition of the variance of the process, which allows for a wide range of temporal dependencies. As the growth approaches quadratic, the convergence rate becomes slower. This variance assumption is related to the time-reduced factorial covariance measure, and we exemplify its validity for various point processes, including the Poisson cluster, Hawkes, Neyman-Scott, and log-Gaussian Cox processes. Complementary to our upper bounds, we also derive matching lower bounds for various spatio-temporal point processes of interest and establish near minimax rate optimality of the empirical Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally, 76 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

Despite the numerous algorithms proposed with different DL architectures, maintaining a balance among performance, computational complexity, and multi-source ECG feature fusion remains challenging. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across various fields. Their inherent design for high-efficiency computation and linear complexity makes them particularly suitable for low-dimensional data like ECGs. This work proposes S2M2ECG, an SSM architecture featuring three-level fusion mechanisms: (1) Spatio-temporal bi-directional SSMs with segment tokenization for low-level signal fusion, (2) Intra-lead temporal information fusion with bi-directional scanning to enhance recognition accuracy in both forward and backward directions, (3) Cross-lead feature interaction modules for spatial information fusion. To fully leverage the ECG-specific multi-lead mechanisms inherent in ECG signals, a multi-branch design and lead fusion modules are incorporated, enabling individual analysis of each lead while ensuring seamless integration with others. Experimental results reveal that S2M2ECG achieves superior performance in the rhythmic, morphological, and clinical scenarios. Moreover, its lightweight architecture ensures it has nearly the fewest parameters among existing models, making it highly suitable for efficient inference and convenient deployment. Collectively, S2M2ECG offers a promising alternative that strikes an excellent balance among performance, computational complexity, and ECG-specific characteristics, paving the way for high-performance, lightweight computations in CVD diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Sequential Ordinal Models: Application to Invasive Weeds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01976v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multivariate sequential ordinal model is investigated for use in the Bayesian analysis of spatio-temporal ordinal data. The sequential ordinal model likelihood is equivalent to a binary model conditional on unknown regression coefficients and spatio-temporal random effects. Therefore, estimation and prediction in the space-time context can proceed using the well-established dynamic generalised linear model framework. Moreover, the sequential ordinal model avoids the ordering constraints on the threshold parameters that determine the category break points required by cumulative ordinal models, and so simplifies the estimation procedure for high-dimensional space-time applications using Bayesian inference. The dynamic spatio-temporal sequential ordinal model is applied to estimate foliage cover abundance of four actively managed invasive alien species. These invasive weed species are observed by means of a modified Braun-Blanquet score that is commonly used in vegetation studies and constitutes ordinal data. The multivariate ordinal data for the managed weeds species are sparsely distributed in space and time with few observations recorded in high foliage cover categories. A separable model for space-time dependence that maintains parameter interpretability in the presence of aggregated ordinal categories is therefore developed. Estimation and prediction is demonstrated using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) methods developed for univariate spatio-temporal models. Bayesian estimation and prediction shows that the four invasive weed species differentially respond to habitat type, control effort and accessibility, and share similar magnitudes of dependence with short effective spatial ranges and strong temporal autocorrelations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transforming Norm-based To Graph-based Spatial Representation for Spatio-Temporal Epidemiological Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14539v3)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pandemics, with their profound societal and economic impacts, pose significant threats to global health, mortality rates, economic stability, and political landscapes. In response to these challenges, numerous studies have employed spatio-temporal models to enhance our understanding and management of these complex phenomena. These spatio-temporal models can be roughly divided into two main spatial categories: norm-based and graph-based. Norm-based models are usually more accurate and easier to model but are more computationally intensive and require more data to fit. On the other hand, graph-based models are less accurate and harder to model but are less computationally intensive and require fewer data to fit. As such, ideally, one would like to use a graph-based model while preserving the representation accuracy obtained by the norm-based model. In this study, we explore the ability to transform from norm-based to graph-based spatial representation for these models. We first show no analytical mapping between the two exists, requiring one to use approximation numerical methods instead. We introduce a novel framework for this task together with twelve possible implementations using a wide range of heuristic optimization approaches. Our findings show that by leveraging agent-based simulations and heuristic algorithms for the graph node's location and population's spatial walk dynamics approximation one can use graph-based spatial representation without losing much of the model's accuracy and expressiveness. We investigate our framework for three real-world cases, achieving 94\% accuracy preservation, on average. Moreover, an analysis of synthetic cases shows the proposed framework is relatively robust for changes in both spatial and temporal properties.</p></details> |  |

While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model. Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic, implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate 1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Flow Matching for Learning Spatio-Temporal Trajectories in 4D Longitudinal Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21580v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions. While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e. predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports $3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.</p></details> |  |

To fully leverage this information, however, the extracted features must be organized in a structured and meaningful way that supports efficient access and use. One promising approach is question answering (QA), which allows users -- especially those unfamiliar with database query languages -- to retrieve knowledge in a natural and intuitive manner. In this project, we developed a GeoQA system by integrating a spatio-temporal knowledge graph (KG) constructed from historical map data with large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we have defined the ontology to guide the construction of the spatio-temporal KG and investigated workflows of two different types of GeoQA: factual and descriptive. Additional data sources, such as historical map images and internet search results, are incorporated into our framework to provide extra context for descriptive GeoQA. Evaluation results demonstrate that the system can generate answers with a high delivery rate and a high semantic accuracy. To make the framework accessible, we further developed a web application that supports interactive querying and visualization.</p></details> |  |

They pose, however, significant computational challenges in high-dimensional settings, which frequently arise in spatial-temporal applications. We present DALIA, a highly scalable framework for performing Bayesian inference tasks on spatio-temporal multivariate GPs, based on the methodology of integrated nested Laplace approximations. Our approach relies on a sparse inverse covariance matrix formulation of the GP, puts forward a GPU-accelerated block-dense approach, and introduces a hierarchical, triple-layer, distributed memory parallel scheme. We showcase weak scaling performance surpassing the state-of-the-art by two orders of magnitude on a model whose parameter space is 8$\times$ larger and measure strong scaling speedups of three orders of magnitude when running on 496 GH200 superchips on the Alps supercomputer. Applying DALIA to air pollution data from northern Italy over 48 days, we showcase refined spatial resolutions over the aggregated pollutant measurements.</p></details> |  |

Privacy statutes such as the GDPR require that any individual's contribution be unlearned on demand, yet retraining deep models from scratch for every request is untenable. We introduce MobText-SISA, a scalable machine-unlearning framework that extends Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and Aggregated (SISA) training to heterogeneous spatio-temporal data. MobText-SISA first embeds each trip's numerical and linguistic features into a shared latent space, then employs similarity-aware clustering to distribute samples across shards so that future deletions touch only a single constituent model while preserving inter-shard diversity. Each shard is trained incrementally; at inference time, constituent predictions are aggregated to yield the output. Deletion requests trigger retraining solely of the affected shard from its last valid checkpoint, guaranteeing exact unlearning. Experiments on a ten-month real-world mobility log demonstrate that MobText-SISA (i) sustains baseline predictive accuracy, and (ii) consistently outperforms random sharding in both error and convergence speed. These results establish MobText-SISA as a practical foundation for privacy-compliant analytics on multimodal mobility data at urban scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The 33rd ACM International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems(SIGSPATIAL '25) as a short paper in the Short Paper Track</p></details> |

It aims to provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network (\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception. The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details, while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Pruning for Compressed Spiking Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20122v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant challenges for deployment in energy-constrained environments due to their large model sizes and high inference latency. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the sparse event-driven neural processing and energy-efficient information transmission in the brain, offer a promising alternative for achieving low-power computing. Integrating the event-driven efficiency of spiking neurons with the advanced capabilities of LLMs represents a promising direction for power-efficient LLMs. This work specifically delves into the design of compressed spiking LLMs. Here, we revisit spatial and temporal pruning from the perspective of SNNs and propose a novel spatio-temporal pruning framework for Spiking LLMs to optimize computational efficiency while preserving high performance. Our spatial pruning technique reduces the number of active neurons and attention heads, effectively lowering the computational complexity of the model. Meanwhile, temporal pruning minimizes inference latency by dynamically adjusting the number of timesteps required for different layers. By combining these approaches with other compression techniques, we present the first work in the domain of Spiking LLMs to jointly explore spatial pruning, temporal pruning, extreme quantization and knowledge distillation strategies.

The approach enables nonparametric and data driven estimation of complex time evolving vector fields while preserving both spatial and temporal structure. We establish representer theorems for time dependent OV-RKHS interpolation, derive Sobolev type approximation bounds for smooth vector fields, and provide spectral convergence guarantees for kernel Koopman operator approximations. This framework supports efficient reduced order modeling and long term prediction of high dimensional nonlinear systems, offering theoretically grounded tools for forecasting, control, and uncertainty quantification in spatio-temporal machine learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep spatio-temporal point processes: Advances and new directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06364v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal point processes (STPPs) model discrete events distributed in time and space, with important applications in areas such as criminology, seismology, epidemiology, and social networks. Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Annua...</summary><p>Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Not Only Consistency: Enhance Test-Time Adaptation with Spatio-temporal Inconsistency for Remote Physiological Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07908v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote physiological measurement (RPM) has emerged as a promising non-invasive method for monitoring physiological signals using the non-contact device. Although various domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the adaptability of deep-based RPM models in unseen deployment environments, considerations in aspects such as privacy concerns and real-time adaptation restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for RPM tasks in this work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the frequency domain of BVP signals, but also that inconsistency in the time domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based self-supervised \textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration (\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference. Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation without accessing source data. The code will be released later.</p></details> |  |

However, current models struggle with ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i) Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii) Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior performance of STA-GANN.</p></details> |  |

While current spatial media technologies have primarily focused on capturing or replaying content as static assets, often disconnected from the viewer's environment or offering limited interactivity, the means to describe an experience's underlying semantic and interactive structure remains underexplored. We propose a descriptive framework called MAR-ED based on three core primitives: 1) Event Primitives for semantic scene graph representation, 2) Keyframe Primitives for efficient and meaningful data access, and 3) Playback Primitives for user-driven adaptive interactive playback of recorded MAR experience. The proposed flowchart of the three-stage process of the proposed MAR-ED framework transforms a recorded experience into a unique adaptive MAR experience during playback, where its spatio-temporal structure dynamically conforms to a new environment and its narrative can be altered by live user input. Drawing on this framework, personal digital memories and recorded events can evolve beyond passive 2D/3D videos into immersive, spatially-integrated group experiences, opening new paradigms for training, cultural heritage, and interactive storytelling without requiring complex, per-user adaptive rendering.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, Accepted in the IEEE ISMAR 2025 XRStand Workshop</p></details> |

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets.</p></details> |  |

Although Selective State Space Models (SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity, the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D, and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

Interpretation of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively. OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention variants attained similar performance.

While various dynamic computation methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn, allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes. Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%, and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA models.</p></details> | 8 pages |

This paper introduces STER-VLM, a computationally efficient framework that enhances VLM performance through (1) caption decomposition to tackle spatial and temporal information separately, (2) temporal frame selection with best-view filtering for sufficient temporal information, and (3) reference-driven understanding for capturing fine-grained motion and dynamic context and (4) curated visual/textual prompt techniques. Experimental results on the WTS \cite{kong2024wts} and BDD \cite{BDD} datasets demonstrate substantial gains in semantic richness and traffic scene interpretation. Our framework is validated through a decent test score of 55.655 in the AI City Challenge 2025 Track 2, showing its effectiveness in advancing resource-efficient and accurate traffic analysis for real-world applications.</p></details> | ICCV Workshop 2025 |

Although Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment, and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that STPFormer consistently sets new SOTA results, with ablation and visualizations confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compact Attention: Exploiting Structured Spatio-Temporal Sparsity for Fast Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12969v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computational demands of self-attention mechanisms pose a critical challenge for transformer-based video generation, particularly in synthesizing ultra-long sequences. Current approaches, such as factorized attention and fixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal redundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion transformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit structured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads dynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern, cross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods either impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a hardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive tiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via dynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity levels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search algorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention pathways. Our method achieves 1.6~2.5x acceleration in attention computation on single-GPU setups while maintaining comparable visual quality with full-attention baselines. This work provides a principled approach to unlocking efficient long-form video generation through structured sparsity exploitation.

A critical research gap lies in identifying the underlying causes of hydrogen bond formation and separation -understanding which interactions or prior events contribute to their emergence over time. With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal data analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these phenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims to identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation events. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an "intervention" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and separation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models are built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us to infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal graphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step to infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal models. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional distributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation, this framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular dynamic systems. We validate the efficacy of our model empirically on the atomic trajectories that used MDS for chiral separation, demonstrating that we can predict many steps in the future and also find the variables driving the observed changes in the system.</p></details> | Submitted to ACM |

The long-term spatio-temporal dependency learning brings two new challenges: 1) The long-term temporal sequence includes multiscale information naturally which is hard to extract efficiently; 2) The multiscale temporal information from different nodes is highly correlated and hard to model. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM2) that includes a multiscale Mamba architecture to capture the multiscale information efficiently and simultaneously, and an adaptive graph causal convolution network to learn the complex multiscale spatio-temporal dependency. STM2 includes hierarchical information aggregation for different-scale information that guarantees their distinguishability. To capture diverse temporal dynamics across all spatial nodes more efficiently, we further propose an enhanced version termed \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM3) that employs a special Mixture-of-Experts architecture, including a more stable routing strategy and a causal contrastive learning strategy to enhance the scale distinguishability. We prove that STM3 has much better routing smoothness and guarantees the pattern disentanglement for each expert successfully. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate STM2/STM3's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in long-term spatio-temporal time-series prediction.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposed PTSM (Physiology-aware and Task-invariant Spatio-temporal Modeling), a novel framework for interpretable and robust EEG decoding across unseen subjects. PTSM employs a dual-branch masking mechanism that independently learns personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns, enabling the model to preserve individual-specific neural characteristics while extracting task-relevant, population-shared features. The masks are factorized across temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing fine-grained modulation of dynamic EEG patterns with low computational overhead. To further address representational entanglement, PTSM enforces information-theoretic constraints that decompose latent embeddings into orthogonal task-related and subject-related subspaces. The model is trained end-to-end via a multi-objective loss integrating classification, contrastive, and disentanglement objectives. Extensive experiments on cross-subject motor imagery datasets demonstrate that PTSM achieves strong zero-shot generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without subject-specific calibration. Results highlight the efficacy of disentangled neural representations for achieving both personalized and transferable decoding in non-stationary neurophysiological settings.</p></details> |  |

While recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding, their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs, revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task. Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning. To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Conventional approaches based on large-scale fixed antenna arrays and UAV trajectory optimization struggle to balance energy efficiency, real-time adaptation, and spatial flexibility. The movable antenna (MA) technology has emerged as a promising solution, offering enhanced spatial flexibility and reduced energy consumption to overcome the bottlenecks of urban low-altitude communications. However, MA deployment faces a critical velocity mismatch between UAV mobility and mechanical repositioning latency, undermining real-time link optimization and security assurance. To overcome this, we propose a predictive MA-UAV collaborative control framework. First, optimal antenna positions are derived via secrecy rate maximization. Second, a Transformer-enhanced long short-term memory (LSTM) network predicts future MA positions by capturing spatio-temporal correlations in antenna trajectories. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior prediction accuracy (NMSE reduction exceeds 49\%) and communication reliability versus current popular benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Retrieval Augmented Spatio-Temporal Framework for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16623v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is a cornerstone of modern intelligent transportation systems and a critical task in spatio-temporal forecasting. Although advanced Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain: (i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns; and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

While traditional matrix time series focus mainly on temporal evolution, our approach incorporates both spatial and temporal dynamics, enabling simultaneous analysis of interactions across multiple dimensions. The inherent endogeneity in spatio-temporal autoregressive models renders ordinary least squares estimation inconsistent. To overcome this difficulty while simultaneously estimating two distinct weight matrices with banded structure, we develop an iterated generalized Yule-Walker estimator by adapting a generalized method of moments framework based on Yule-Walker equations. Moreover, unlike conventional models that employ a single bandwidth parameter, the dual-bandwidth specification in our framework requires a new two-step, ratio-based sequential estimation procedure.</p></details> |  |

Beyond a high number of ignitions, the country has experienced devastating mega-fires, such as those in 2017. Accurate forecasting of wildfire occurrence and burned areas is therefore essential for effective firefighting resource allocation and emergency preparedness. In this study, we present a novel two-stage ensemble approach that extends the widely used latent Gaussian modelling framework with the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) for spatio-temporal wildfire forecasting. The first stage uses XGBoost, a gradient boosting model, to identify wildfire patterns from environmental covariates and historical fire records, producing one-month-ahead point forecasts for fire counts and burned area. These predictions are then incorporated as external covariates in a latent Gaussian model, which includes additional spatiotemporal random effects to produce the final probabilistic forecasts of monthly total fire counts and burned area at the council level. To effectively model both moderate and extreme wildfire events, we implement the extended generalised Pareto (eGP) likelihood (a sub-asymptotic distribution) within the INLA framework. We also develop and discuss penalised complexity priors (PC-priors) for the eGP parameters and provide a comprehensive comparison of the eGP likelihood against other commonly employed distributions in environmental modelling, such as the Gamma and Weibull distributions. The proposed framework addresses the challenge of accessing future environmental covariates, which are typically unavailable at prediction time, and demonstrates strong performance in one-month-ahead wildfire forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We present STAC, a cross-cameras surveillance system that leverages spatio-temporal associations for efficient object tracking under constrained network conditions. STAC integrates multi-resolution feature learning, ensuring robustness under variable networked system level optimizations such as frame filtering, FFmpeg-based compression, and Region-of-Interest (RoI) masking, to eliminate redundant content across distributed video streams while preserving downstream model accuracy for object identification and tracking. Evaluated on NVIDIA's AICity Challenge dataset, STAC achieves a 76\% improvement in tracking accuracy and an 8.6x reduction in inference latency over a standard multi-object multi-camera tracking baseline (using YOLOv4 and DeepSORT). Furthermore, 29\% of redundant frames are filtered, significantly reducing data volume without compromising inference quality.</p></details> |  |

Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

We introduce a Physics- and Geometry- Aware Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator ($\pi$G-Sp$^2$GNO) for learning the solution operators of time-independent and time-dependent PDEs. The proposed approach first improves upon the recently developed Sp$^2$GNO by enabling geometry awareness and subsequently exploits the governing physics to learn the underlying solution operator in a simulation-free setup. While the spatio-spectral structure present in the proposed architecture allows multiscale learning, two separate strategies for enabling geometry awareness is introduced in this paper. For time dependent problems, we also introduce a novel hybrid physics informed loss function that combines higher-order time-marching scheme with upscaled theory inspired stochastic projection scheme. This allows accurate integration of the physics-information into the loss function. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated on number of benchmark examples involving regular and complex domains, variation in geometry during inference, and time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results obtained illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach as compared to the state-of-the-art physics-informed neural operator algorithms in the literature.</p></details> |  |

Thus, the USVs need to continuously adapt their paths with real-time information to avoid collisions and follow the path of least resistance to the goal via exploiting ocean currents. In this regard, we introduce a novel algorithm, called Self-Morphing Adaptive Replanning Tree for dynamic Obstacles and Currents (SMART-OC), that facilitates real-time time-risk optimal replanning in dynamic environments. SMART-OC integrates the obstacle risks along a path with the time cost to reach the goal to find the time-risk optimal path. The effectiveness of SMART-OC is validated by simulation experiments, which demonstrate that the USV performs fast replannings to avoid dynamic obstacles and exploit ocean currents to successfully reach the goal.</p></details> |  |

Despite this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI. This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}. To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for \underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, incomplete version</p></details> |
| **[Urban-STA4CLC: Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08976v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires increasingly introduce unusual disturbance on economic activities, which are especially likely to reshape commercial land use pattern given their sensitive to customer visitation. However, current modeling approaches are limited in capturing such complex interplay between human activities and commercial land use change under and following disturbances. Such interactions have been more effectively captured in current resilient urban planning theories. This study designs and calibrates a Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change (Urban-STA4CLC) to predict both the yearly decline and expansion of commercial land use at census block level under cumulative impact of disasters on human activities over two years. Guided by urban theories, Urban-STA4CLC integrates both spatial and temporal attention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules. Resilience theory guides a disaster-aware temporal attention module that captures visitation dynamics. Spatial economic theory informs a multi-relational spatial attention module for inter-block representation. Diffusion theory contributes a regularization term that constrains land use transitions. The model performs significantly better than non-theoretical baselines in predicting commercial land use change under the scenario of recurrent hurricanes, with around 19% improvement in F1 score (0.8763). The effectiveness of the theory-guided modules was further validated through ablation studies. The research demonstrates that embedding urban theory into commercial land use modeling models may substantially enhance the capacity to capture its gains and losses. These advances in commercial land use modeling contribute to land use research that accounts for cumulative impacts of recurrent disasters and shifts in economic activity patterns.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often rely on complex module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts, high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency, reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while maintaining competitive recognition performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[B-VLLM: A Vision Large Language Model with Balanced Spatio-Temporal Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09919v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) integrated with vision encoders have shown promising performance in vision understanding. The key of VLLMs is to encode visual content into sequences of visual tokens, enabling VLLMs to simultaneously process both visual and textual content. However, understanding videos, especially long videos, remain a challenge to VLLMs as the number of visual tokens grows rapidly when encoding videos, resulting in the risk of exceeding the context window of VLLMs and introducing heavy computation burden. To restrict the number of visual tokens, existing VLLMs either: (1) uniformly downsample videos into a fixed number of frames or (2) reducing the number of visual tokens encoded from each frame. We argue the former solution neglects the rich temporal cue in videos and the later overlooks the spatial details in each frame. In this work, we present Balanced-VLLM (B-VLLM): a novel VLLM framework that aims to effectively leverage task relevant spatio-temporal cues while restricting the number of visual tokens under the VLLM context window length. At the core of our method, we devise a text-conditioned adaptive frame selection module to identify frames relevant to the visual understanding task. The selected frames are then de-duplicated using a temporal frame token merging technique. The visual tokens of the selected frames are processed through a spatial token sampling module and an optional spatial token merging strategy to achieve precise control over the token count. Experimental results show that B-VLLM is effective in balancing the number of frames and visual tokens in video understanding, yielding superior performance on various video understanding benchmarks.

While many spatio-temporal methods focus on improving accuracy, fairness has recently gained attention due to growing evidence that biased predictions in spatio-temporal applications can disproportionately disadvantage certain demographic or geographic groups, thereby reinforcing existing socioeconomic inequalities and undermining the ethical deployment of AI in public services. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, FairDRL-ST, based on disentangled representation learning, to address fairness concerns in spatio-temporal prediction, with a particular focus on mobility demand forecasting. By leveraging adversarial learning and disentangled representation learning, our framework learns to separate attributes that contain sensitive information. Unlike existing methods that enforce fairness through supervised learning, which may lead to overcompensation and degraded performance, our framework achieves fairness in an unsupervised manner with minimal performance loss. We apply our framework to real-world urban mobility datasets and demonstrate its ability to close fairness gaps while delivering competitive predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art fairness-aware methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Research Paper (short) at ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025.

However, there exist very limited FL works in surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider inherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show diverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation; ii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data generation with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized FL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST), which wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and global-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site training, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to encode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized globally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including the temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel selection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating model adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an explicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model convergence during fusion for improving model generalization.</p></details> |  |

Given that the typical data (i.e., videos and images) collected by the fleet of UAVs deployed in such scenarios can be considerably larger than what the onboard computers can process, the UAVs need to offload their data in real-time to the edge and the cloud for further processing. To that end, we present the design of AerialDB - a lightweight decentralized data storage and query system that can store and process time series data on a multi-UAV system comprising: A) a fleet of hundreds of UAVs fitted with onboard computers, and B) ground-based edge servers connected through a cellular link. Leveraging lightweight techniques for content-based replica placement and indexing of shards, AerialDB has been optimized for efficient processing of different possible combinations of typical spatial and temporal queries performed by real-world disaster management applications. Using containerized deployment spanning up to 400 drones and 80 edges, we demonstrate that AerialDB is able to scale efficiently while providing near real-time performance with different realistic workloads. Further, AerialDB comprises a decentralized and locality-aware distributed execution engine which provides graceful degradation of performance upon edge failures with relatively low latency while processing large spatio-temporal data. AerialDB exhibits comparable insertion performance and 100 times improvement in query performance against state-of-the-art baseline. Moreover, it exhibits a 10 times and 100 times improvement with insertion and query workloads respectively over the cloud baseline.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the first treatment-aware spatio-temporal diffusion model that is able to generate future masks demonstrating lesion evolution in MS. Our voxel-space approach incorporates multi-modal patient data, including MRI and treatment information, to forecast new and enlarging T2 (NET2) lesion masks at a future time point. Extensive experiments on a multi-centre dataset of 2131 patient 3D MRIs from randomized clinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS demonstrate that our generative model is able to accurately predict NET2 lesion masks for patients across six different treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate our model has the potential for real-world clinical applications through downstream tasks such as future lesion count and location estimation, binary lesion activity classification, and generating counterfactual future NET2 masks for several treatments with different efficacies. This work highlights the potential of causal, image-based generative models as powerful tools for advancing data-driven prognostics in MS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI 2025 (LMID Workshop)</p></details> |

Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing, which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free, architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time, establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9% on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TITE-Safety: Time-to-event Safety Monitoring for Clinical Trials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03175v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety evaluation is an essential component of clinical trials. To protect study participants, these studies often implement safety stopping rules that will halt the trial if an excessive number of toxicity events occur. Existing safety monitoring methods often treat these events as binary outcomes. A strategy that instead handles these as time-to-event endpoints can offer higher power and a reduced time to signal of excess risk, but must manage additional complexities including censoring and competing risks. We propose the TITE-Safety approach for safety monitoring, which incorporates time-to-event information while handling censored observations and competing risks appropriately. This strategy is applied to develop stopping rules using score tests, Bayesian beta-extended binomial models, and sequential probability ratio tests. The operating characteristics of these methods are studied via simulation for common phase 2 and 3 trial scenarios. Across simulation settings, the proposed techniques offer reductions in expected toxicities of 20% or more compared to binary data methods and maintain the type I error rate near the nominal level across various event time distributions. These methods are demonstrated through a redesign of the safety monitoring scheme for BMT CTN 0601, a single arm, phase 2 trial that evaluated bone marrow transplant as treatment for severe sickle cell disease. Our R package "stoppingrule" offers functions to construct and evaluate these stopping rules, providing valuable tools for trial design to investigators.</p></details> |  |

Traditional leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) models, while widely used, exhibit high relative error in predicting AP onset latency, especially under strong or rapidly changing stimuli. Inspired by recent experimental findings and quantum theory, we present a quantum-inspired leaky integrate-and-fire (QI-LIF) model that treats AP onset as a probabilistic event, represented by a Gaussian wave packet in time. This approach captures the biological variability and uncertainty inherent in neuronal firing. We systematically compare the relative error of AP onset predictions between the classical LIF and QI-LIF models using synthetic data from hippocampal and sensory neurons subjected to varying stimulus amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that the QI-LIF model significantly reduces prediction error, particularly for high-intensity stimuli, aligning closely with observed biological responses. This work highlights the potential of quantum-inspired computational frameworks in advancing the accuracy of neural modeling and has implications for quantum engineering approaches to brain-inspired computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real Time Headway Predictions in Urban Rail Systems and Implications for Service Control: A Deep Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03121v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient real-time dispatching in urban metro systems is essential for ensuring service reliability, maximizing resource utilization, and improving passenger satisfaction. This study presents a novel deep learning framework centered on a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model designed to predict the complex spatiotemporal propagation of train headways across an entire metro line. By directly incorporating planned terminal headways as a critical input alongside historical headway data, the proposed model accurately forecasts future headway dynamics, effectively capturing both their temporal evolution and spatial dependencies across all stations. This capability empowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control decisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We introduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies, ranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived from observed terminal departures. In contrast to existing research primarily focused on passenger load predictioning or atypical disruption scenarios, our approach emphasizes proactive operational control. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset from an urban metro line, the proposed ConvLSTM model demonstrates promising headway predictions, offering actionable insights for real-time decision-making. This framework provides rail operators with a powerful, computationally efficient tool to optimize dispatching strategies, thereby significantly improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Feedback-Feedforward Algorithms for Time-Varying Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03912v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies distributed Time-Varying Resource Allocation (TVRA) where the local cost functions, global equality constraints, and Local Feasibility Constraints (LFCs) vary with time. Algorithms that mimic the structure of feedback-feedforward control systems are proposed. Feedback and feedforward laws are generated using local estimates from a distributed estimator, while a distributed controller enforces the stationarity condition within a fixed time and updates the candidate solution accordingly. To handle the LFCs, feedback laws based on projection and feedforward laws that switch between different modes are introduced as an initialization-free alternative to the barrier-based methods used in most related works. Our projection-based method guarantees that, for any infeasible initial value, the state trajectory enters the locally feasible set within a fixed time and remains within it thereafter, and that the set is forward invariant if the initial value is locally feasible. Convergence analyses are conducted under mild assumptions. For cases without LFCs, the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal trajectory within a fixed time. For cases with LFCs, the proposed algorithm is globally asymptotically stable at the optimal trajectory while exhibiting fixed-time convergence between consecutive switching instants. Numerical examples and a power system application verify their effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

We formulate a continuation-based approach that employs numerical integration to follow eigenvalues as system parameters vary, in the presence of one or multiple delayed variables. The formulation preserves the sparsity of the delay differential-algebraic equation (DDAE) system model and allows treating the delay magnitude itself as a varying parameter with implementation aspects discussed in detail. Accuracy is demonstrated on a modified IEEE 39-bus system with distributed energy resources. Scalability is discussed using a realistic dynamic model of the Irish transmission network.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading for Multi-Microgrids: Improved Double Auction Mechanism and Prediction-Free Online Trading Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02985v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Peer-to-peer energy trading offers a promising solution for enhancing renewable energy utilization and economic benefits within interconnected microgrids. However, existing real-time P2P markets face two key challenges: high computational complexity in trading mechanisms, and suboptimal participant decision-making under diverse uncertainties. Existing prediction-based decision-making methods rely heavily on accurate forecasts, which are typically unavailable for microgrids, while prediction-free methods suffer from myopic behaviors. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an improved double auction mechanism combined with an adaptive step-size search algorithm to reduce computational burden, and a data-driven dual-reference online optimization (DDOO) framework to enhance participant decision-making. The improved mechanism simplifies bidding procedures, significantly reducing computational burden and ensuring rapid convergence to the market equilibrium. Additionally, the prediction-free DDOO framework mitigates myopic decision-making by introducing two informative reference signals. Case studies on a 20-microgrid system demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed mechanism and approach. The improved mechanism significantly decreases the computational time while increasing local energy self-sufficiency periods from 0.01% to 29.86%, reducing reverse power flow periods from 24.51% to 3.96%, and lowering average operating costs by 19.20%. Compared with conventional approaches such as Lyapunov optimization and model predictive control, the DDOO framework achieves a 10%-13% reduction in operating costs with an optimality gap of only 5.76%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient adjustment sets for time-dependent treatment effect estimation in nonparametric causal graphical model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01000v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Criteria for identifying optimal adjustment sets yielding consistent estimation with minimal asymptotic variance of average treatment effects in parametric and nonparametric models have recently been established. In a single treatment time point setting, it has been shown that the optimal adjustment set can be identified based on a causal directed acyclic graph alone. In a time-dependent treatment setting, previous work has established graphical rules to compare the asymptotic variance of estimators based on nested time-dependent adjustment sets. However, these rules do not always permit the identification of an optimal time-dependent adjustment set based on a causal graph alone. We extend those results by exploiting conditional independencies that can be read from the graph and demonstrate theoretically and empirically that our results can yield estimators with lower asymptotic variance than those allowed by previous results. We further show how our results allow for the identification of optimal adjustment sets based on a directed acyclic graph alone in the time-dependent treatment setting.</p></details> | 24 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Symbol Timing Synchronization and Signal Detection for Ambient Backscatter Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02981v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables ambient Internet of Things (AIoT) devices to achieve ultra-low-power, low-cost, and massive connectivity. Most existing AmBC studies assume ideal synchronization between the backscatter device (BD) and the backscatter receiver (BR). However, in practice, symbol timing offset (STO) occurs due to both the propagation delay and the BR activation latency, which leads to unreliable symbol recovery at the BR. Moreover, the uncontrollable nature of the ambient radio frequency source renders conventional correlation-based synchronization methods infeasible in AmBC. To address this challenge, we investigate STO estimation and symbol detection in AmBC without requiring coordination from the ambient radio frequency source. Firstly, we design a specialized pilot sequence at the BD to induce sampling errors in the pilot signal. Furthermore, we propose a pilot-based STO estimator using the framework of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which can exploit the statistical variations in the received pilot signal. Finally, we integrate STO compensation into an energy detector and evaluate the bit error rate (BER) performance. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator achieves accurate STO estimation and effectively mitigates the BER performance degradation caused by STO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Nonlinear Model Predictive Control of Heavy-Duty Skid-Steered Mobile Platform for Trajectory Tracking Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02976v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a framework for real-time optimal controlling of a heavy-duty skid-steered mobile platform for trajectory tracking. The importance of accurate real-time performance of the controller lies in safety considerations of situations where the dynamic system under control is affected by uncertainties and disturbances, and the controller should compensate for such phenomena in order to provide stable performance. A multiple-shooting nonlinear model-predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. This framework benefits from suitable algorithm along with readings from various sensors for genuine real-time performance with extremely high accuracy. The controller is then tested for tracking different trajectories where it demonstrates highly desirable performance in terms of both speed and accuracy. This controller shows remarkable improvement when compared to existing nonlinear model-predictive controllers in the literature that were implemented on skid-steered mobile platforms.</p></details> |  |

The methods combine a resonance-based scheme for the twisted variable with a dynamically adjusted relaxation parameter that guarantees exact mass conservation. Unlike existing symmetric or structure-preserving low-regularity integrators, which are typically implicit and computationally expensive, the proposed methods are fully explicit, mass-conserving, and well-suited for solutions with low regularity. Furthermore, the schemes can be naturally extended to a broad class of evolution equations exhibiting the structure of strongly continuous contraction semigroups. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and excellent long-time behavior of the methods under low-regularity conditions.</p></details> |  |

Prior work has shown that stochastic sparse sampling effectively handles variable-length signals, while retrieval-augmented approaches improve explainability and robustness to noise and weak temporal correlations. In this study, we generalize the stochastic sparse sampling framework for retrieval-informed classification. Specifically, we weight window predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability space, yielding convex series-level scores and an explicit evidence trail for explainability. Our method achieves competitive iEEG classification performance and provides practitioners with greater transparency and explainability. We evaluate our method in iEEG recordings collected in four medical centers, demonstrating its potential for reliable and explainable clinical variable-length time series classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Learning from Time Series for Health</p></details> |
| **[Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02919v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve complex reasoning tasks via long chain-of-thought, but their forward-only autoregressive generation process is fragile; early token errors can cascade, which creates a clear need for self-reflection mechanisms. However, existing self-reflection either performs revisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training, both fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time framework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token generation, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify high-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific corrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a self-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By retrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more trustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors at highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model reasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger self-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on Pass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5. Moreover, our findings position SRGen as a plug-and-play method that integrates reflection into the generation process for reliable LLM reasoning, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and broad composability with other training-time (e.g., RLHF) and test-time (e.g., SLOT) techniques.</p></details> | 24 pages, 8 figures |

However, previous audio hiding methods often result in unsatisfactory quality when recovering secret audio, due to their inherent limitations in the modeling of time-frequency relationships. In this paper, we explore these limitations and introduce a new DNN-based approach. We use a flow-based invertible neural network to establish a direct link between stego audio, cover audio, and secret audio, enhancing the reversibility of embedding and extracting messages. To address common issues from time-frequency transformations that degrade secret audio quality during recovery, we implement a time-frequency loss on the time-domain signal. This approach not only retains the benefits of time-frequency constraints but also enhances the reversibility of message recovery, which is vital for practical applications. We also add an encryption technique to protect the hidden data from unauthorized access. Experimental results on the VCTK and LibriSpeech datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches in terms of subjective and objective metrics and exhibits robustness to various types of noise, suggesting its utility in targeted secure communication scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, project page: https://cyberrrange.github.io/project/wavinwav</p></details> |
| **[Testing LRD in the spectral domain for functional time series in manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07731v4)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A statistical hypothesis test for long range dependence (LRD) is formulated in the spectral domain for functional time series in manifolds. The elements of the spectral density operator family are assumed to be invariant with respect to the group of isometries of the manifold. The proposed test statistic is based on the weighted periodogram operator. A Central Limit Theorem is derived to obtain the asymptotic Gaussian distribution of the proposed test statistic operator under the null hypothesis. The rate of convergence to zero, in the Hilbert--Schmidt operator norm, of the bias of the integrated empirical second and fourth order cumulant spectral density operators is obtained under the alternative hypothesis. The consistency of the test follows from the consistency of the integrated weighted periodogram operator under LRD. Practical implementation of our testing approach is based on the random projection methodology. A simulation study illustrates, in the context of spherical functional time series, the asymptotic normality of the test statistic under the null hypothesis, and its consistency under the alternative. The empirical size and power properties are also computed for different functional sample sizes, and under different scenarios.</p></details> | No comments |
| **[Relevance-Aware Thresholding in Online Conformal Prediction for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02809v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP) becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time. Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation (inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods while maintaining coverage validity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Periodic Event-Triggered Prescribed Time Control of Euler-Lagrange Systems under State and Input Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02769v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article proposes a periodic event-triggered adaptive barrier control policy for the trajectory tracking problem of perturbed Euler-Lagrangian systems with state, input, and temporal (SIT) constraints. In particular, an approximation-free adaptive-barrier control architecture is designed to ensure prescribed-time convergence of the tracking error to a prescribed bound while rejecting exogenous disturbances. In contrast to existing approaches that necessitate continuous real-time control action, the proposed controller generates event-based updates through periodic evaluation of the triggering condition. Additionally, we derive an upper bound on the monitoring period by analysing the performance degradation of the filtered tracking error to facilitate periodic evaluation of the event-triggered strategy. To this end, a time-varying threshold function is considered in the triggering mechanism to reduce the number of triggers during the transient phase of system behaviour. Notably, the proposed design avoids Zeno behaviour and precludes the need for continuous monitoring of the triggering condition. A simulation and experimental study is undertaken to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control scheme.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Test-time Adaptation for Object Recognition and Detection with Vision-language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02750v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection), and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction. This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood (measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition and detection benchmarks.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Accuracy Law for the Future of Deep Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02729v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100% accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics, e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

Compared with other domains, time series forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[A $1000\times$ Faster LLM-enhanced Algorithm For Path Planning in Large-scale Grid Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02716v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Path planning in grid maps, arising from various applications, has garnered significant attention. Existing methods, such as A*, Dijkstra, and their variants, work well for small-scale maps but fail to address large-scale ones due to high search time and memory consumption. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in path planning but still suffer from spatial illusion and poor planning performance. Among all the works, LLM-A* \cite{meng2024llm} leverages LLM to generate a series of waypoints and then uses A* to plan the paths between the neighboring waypoints. In this way, the complete path is constructed. However, LLM-A* still suffers from high computational time for large-scale maps. To fill this gap, we conducted a deep investigation into LLM-A* and found its bottleneck, resulting in limited performance. Accordingly, we design an innovative LLM-enhanced algorithm, abbr. as iLLM-A*. iLLM-A* includes 3 carefully designed mechanisms, including the optimization of A*, an incremental learning method for LLM to generate high-quality waypoints, and the selection of the appropriate waypoints for A* for path planning. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation on various grid maps shows that, compared with LLM-A*, iLLM-A* \textbf{1) achieves more than $1000\times$ speedup on average, and up to $2349.5\times$ speedup in the extreme case, 2) saves up to $58.6\%$ of the memory cost, 3) achieves both obviously shorter path length and lower path length standard deviation.}</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments, failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present the first comprehensive survival analysis of conversational AI robustness, analyzing 36,951 conversation turns across 9 state-of-the-art LLMs to model failure as a time-to-event process. Our survival modeling framework-employing Cox proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest approaches-reveals extraordinary temporal dynamics. We find that abrupt, prompt-to-prompt(P2P) semantic drift is catastrophic, dramatically increasing the hazard of conversational failure. In stark contrast, gradual, cumulative drift is highly protective, vastly reducing the failure hazard and enabling significantly longer dialogues. AFT models with interactions demonstrate superior performance, achieving excellent discrimination and exceptional calibration. These findings establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm for evaluating LLM robustness, offer concrete insights for designing resilient conversational agents, and challenge prevailing assumptions about the necessity of semantic consistency in conversational AI Systems.</p></details> |  |

Preview-based suspension control mitigates their impact by detecting such irregularities in advance and adjusting suspension parameters proactively. Accurate and real-time detection is essential, but embedded deployment is constrained by limited computational resources and the small size of targets in input images.To address these challenges, this paper proposes SBP-YOLO, an efficient detection framework for speed bumps and potholes in embedded systems. Built upon YOLOv11n, it integrates GhostConv and VoVGSCSPC modules in the backbone and neck to reduce computation while enhancing multi-scale semantic features. A P2-level branch improves small-object detection, and a lightweight and efficient detection head (LEDH) maintains accuracy with minimal overhead. A hybrid training strategy further enhances robustness under varying road and environmental conditions, combining NWD loss, BCKD knowledge distillation, and Albumentations-based augmentation. Experiments show that SBP-YOLO achieves 87.0% mAP, outperforming the YOLOv11n baseline by 5.8%. After TensorRT FP16 quantization, it runs at 139.5 FPS on Jetson AGX Xavier, yielding a 12.4% speedup over the P2-enhanced YOLOv11. These results demonstrate the framework's suitability for fast, low-latency road condition perception in embedded suspension control systems.</p></details> | 14pages,11figures |

While classical methods like Waveform Similarity-based Overlap-Add (WSOLA) provide strong baselines, they often introduce artifacts under non-stationary or extreme stretching conditions. We propose STSM-FILM - a fully neural architecture that incorporates Feature-Wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to condition the model on a continuous speed factor. By supervising the network using WSOLA-generated outputs, STSM-FILM learns to mimic alignment and synthesis behaviors while benefiting from representations learned through deep learning. We explore four encoder-decoder variants: STFT-HiFiGAN, WavLM-HiFiGAN, Whisper-HiFiGAN, and EnCodec, and demonstrate that STSM-FILM is capable of producing perceptually consistent outputs across a wide range of time-scaling factors. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of FiLM-based conditioning to improve the generalization and flexibility of neural TSM models.</p></details> |  |

This approach is based on a harmonic transformation of the Lyapunov function and a novel piecewise quadratic representation of this transformed Lyapunov function over a simplicial partition of the state space. The problem is solved in a policy iteration fashion, whereas the evaluation and improvement steps are formulated as linear matrix inequalities employing the structural relaxation approach. Though initially formulated for uncertain polytopic systems, extensions to piecewise and nonlinear systems are discussed. Three examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in different scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint - Initial submission submitted to Automatica</p></details> |
| **[Multi-robot Rigid Formation Navigation via Synchronous Motion and Discrete-time Communication-Control Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02624v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rigid-formation navigation of multiple robots is essential for applications such as cooperative transportation. This process involves a team of collaborative robots maintaining a predefined geometric configuration, such as a square, while in motion. For untethered collaborative motion, inter-robot communication must be conducted through a wireless network. Notably, few existing works offer a comprehensive solution for multi-robot formation navigation executable on microprocessor platforms via wireless networks, particularly for formations that must traverse complex curvilinear paths. To address this gap, we introduce a novel "hold-and-hit" communication-control framework designed to work seamlessly with the widely-used Robotic Operating System (ROS) platform. The hold-and-hit framework synchronizes robot movements in a manner robust against wireless network delays and packet loss. It operates over discrete-time communication-control cycles, making it suitable for implementation on contemporary microprocessors. Complementary to hold-and-hit, we propose an intra-cycle optimization approach that enables rigid formations to closely follow desired curvilinear paths, even under the nonholonomic movement constraints inherent to most vehicular robots. The combination of hold-and-hit and intra-cycle optimization ensures precise and reliable navigation even in challenging scenarios. Simulations in a virtual environment demonstrate the superiority of our method in maintaining a four-robot square formation along an S-shaped path, outperforming two existing approaches. Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework: the robots maintained an inter-distance error within $\pm 0.069m$ and an inter-angular orientation error within $\pm19.15^{\circ}$ while navigating along an S-shaped path at a fixed linear velocity of $0.1 m/s$.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art prevention-based defenses typically rely on fine-tuning an LLM to enhance its security, but they achieve limited effectiveness against strong attacks. In this work, we propose \emph{SecInfer}, a novel defense against prompt injection attacks built on \emph{inference-time scaling}, an emerging paradigm that boosts LLM capability by allocating more compute resources for reasoning during inference. SecInfer consists of two key steps: \emph{system-prompt-guided sampling}, which generates multiple responses for a given input by exploring diverse reasoning paths through a varied set of system prompts, and \emph{target-task-guided aggregation}, which selects the response most likely to accomplish the intended task. Extensive experiments show that, by leveraging additional compute at inference, SecInfer effectively mitigates both existing and adaptive prompt injection attacks, outperforming state-of-the-art defenses as well as existing inference-time scaling approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Input-Aware Sparse Attention for Real-Time Co-Speech Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02617v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However, existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model. Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss, our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://beijia11.github.io/IASA</p></details> |

Many of the available visual SLAM methods are based on the assumption of a static world and struggle in dynamic environments. In the current study, we introduce a real-time semantic RGBD SLAM approach designed specifically for dynamic environments. Our proposed system can effectively detect moving objects and maintain a static map to ensure robust camera tracking. The key innovation of our approach is the incorporation of deep learning-based semantic information into SLAM systems to mitigate the impact of dynamic objects. Additionally, we enhance the semantic segmentation process by integrating an Extended Kalman filter to identify dynamic objects that may be temporarily idle. We have also implemented a generative network to fill in the missing regions of input images belonging to dynamic objects. This highly modular framework has been implemented on the ROS platform and can achieve around 22 fps on a GTX1080. Benchmarking the developed pipeline on dynamic sequences from the TUM dataset suggests that the proposed approach delivers competitive localization error in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, all while operating in near real-time.

| **[On the Role of Temperature Sampling in Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02611v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces. Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3 (0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning (RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent potential of base models.</p></details> |  |

However, raw watch times are influenced by confounding factors such as video duration, popularity, and individual user behaviors, potentially distorting preference signals and resulting in biased recommendation models. We propose a novel relative advantage debiasing framework that corrects watch time by comparing it to empirically derived reference distributions conditioned on user and item groups. This approach yields a quantile-based preference signal and introduces a two-stage architecture that explicitly separates distribution estimation from preference learning. Additionally, we present distributional embeddings to efficiently parameterize watch-time quantiles without requiring online sampling or storage of historical data. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and robustness compared to existing baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

DRL has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and, like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.</p></details> |  |

To avoid placing distributional assumptions on the data, in recent years the conformal prediction method has been a popular approach for predictive inference, since it provides distribution-free coverage for any iid or exchangeable data distribution. However, in the time series setting, the strong empirical performance of conformal prediction methods is not well understood, since even short-range temporal dependence is a strong violation of the exchangeability assumption. Using predictors with "memory" -- i.e., predictors that utilize past observations, such as autoregressive models -- further exacerbates this problem. In this work, we examine the theoretical properties of split conformal prediction in the time series setting, including the case where predictors may have memory. Our results bound the loss of coverage of these methods in terms of a new "switch coefficient", measuring the extent to which temporal dependence within the time series creates violations of exchangeability. Our characterization of the coverage probability is sharp over the class of stationary, $\beta$-mixing processes. Along the way, we introduce tools that may prove useful in analyzing other predictive inference methods for dependent data.</p></details> | 22 pages |

While Transformers have been the dominant architecture, recent alternatives such as xLSTM offer linear complexity with respect to context length while remaining competitive in the billion-parameter regime. We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior of Transformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guide future model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior for xLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP and parametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number of training tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal model sizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previous work. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics. Our findings reveal that in typical LLM training and inference scenarios, xLSTM scales favorably compared to Transformers. Importantly, xLSTM's advantage widens as training and inference contexts grow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/NX-AI/xlstm_scaling_laws</p></details> |

Recently, time series foundation models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.</p></details> |  |

Existing personalization approaches typically require extensive pre-recorded data and place the burden of adaptation on the DHH speaker. We present EvolveCaptions, a real-time, collaborative ASR adaptation system that supports in-situ personalization with minimal effort. Hearing participants correct ASR errors during live conversations. Based on these corrections, the system generates short, phonetically targeted prompts for the DHH speaker to record, which are then used to fine-tune the ASR model. In a study with 12 DHH and six hearing participants, EvolveCaptions reduced Word Error Rate (WER) across all DHH users within one hour of use, using only five minutes of recording time on average. Participants described the system as intuitive, low-effort, and well-integrated into communication. These findings demonstrate the promise of collaborative, real-time ASR adaptation for more equitable communication.</p></details> |  |

The proposed solution uses the Vision Transformer for Video (ViViT) model for video feature extraction and the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) for audio analysis. The system implements a Tensor Fusion Network (TFN) architecture that explicitly models unimodal and bimodal interactions through a 2-fold Cartesian product. This advanced fusion technique captures complex cross-modal dynamics between visual behaviors (e.g., tailgating,unauthorized access) and audio cues (e.g., fare transaction sounds). The system was trained and tested on a custom dataset, achieving an accuracy of 89.5%, precision of 87.2%, and recall of 84.0% in detecting fraudulent activities, significantly outperforming early fusion baselines and exceeding the 75% recall rates typically reported in state-of-the-art transportation fraud detection systems. Our ablation studies demonstrate that the tensor fusion approach provides a 7.0% improvement in the F1 score and an 8.8% boost in recall compared to traditional concatenation methods. The solution supports real-time detection, enabling public transport operators to reduce revenue loss, improve passenger safety, and ensure operational compliance.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Policy Gradient Guidance Enables Test Time Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02148v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), a simple extension of classifier-free guidance from diffusion models to classical policy gradient methods. PGG augments the policy gradient with an unconditional branch and interpolates conditional and unconditional branches, yielding a test-time control knob that modulates behavior without retraining. We provide a theoretical derivation showing that the additional normalization term vanishes under advantage estimation, leading to a clean guided policy gradient update. Empirically, we evaluate PGG on discrete and continuous control benchmarks. We find that conditioning dropout-central to diffusion guidance-offers gains in simple discrete tasks and low sample regimes, but dropout destabilizes continuous control. Training with modestly larger guidance ($\gamma>1$) consistently improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability. Our results show that guidance, previously confined to diffusion policies, can be adapted to standard on-policy methods, opening new directions for controllable online reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

In the simplest variant, a decision maker is presented with $n$ boxes, each associated with a cost of inspection and a hidden random reward. The decision maker inspects a subset of these boxes one after the other, in a possibly adaptive order, and gains the difference between the largest revealed reward and the sum of the inspection costs. Although this classic version is well understood (Weitzman 1979), there is a flourishing recent literature on variants of the problem. Here we introduce a general framework -- the Pandora's Box Over Time problem -- that captures a wide range of variants where time plays a role, e.g., by constraining the schedules of exploration and influencing costs and rewards. In our framework, boxes have time-dependent rewards and costs, whereas inspection may require a box-specific processing time. Moreover, once a box is inspected, its reward may deteriorate over time. Our main result is an efficient constant-factor approximation to the optimal strategy for the Pandora's Box Over Time problem, which is generally NP-hard to compute. We further obtain improved results for the natural special cases where boxes have no processing time, boxes are available only in specific time slots, or when costs and reward distributions are time-independent (but rewards may still deteriorate after inspection).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper unifies and extends preliminary versions that appeared in AAAI 2024 (DOI:10.1609/aaai.v38i18.30015) and WINE 2024 (arXiv:2407.15261v1)</p></details> |
| **[Accuracy of Discretely Sampled Stochastic Policies in Continuous-time Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09981v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic policies (also known as relaxed controls) are widely used in continuous-time reinforcement learning algorithms. However, executing a stochastic policy and evaluating its performance in a continuous-time environment remain open challenges. This work introduces and rigorously analyzes a policy execution framework that samples actions from a stochastic policy at discrete time points and implements them as piecewise constant controls. We prove that as the sampling mesh size tends to zero, the controlled state process converges weakly to the dynamics with coefficients aggregated according to the stochastic policy. We explicitly quantify the convergence rate based on the regularity of the coefficients and establish an optimal first-order convergence rate for sufficiently regular coefficients. Additionally, we prove a $1/2$-order weak convergence rate that holds uniformly over the sampling noise with high probability, and establish a $1/2$-order pathwise convergence for each realization of the system noise in the absence of volatility control. Building on these results, we analyze the bias and variance of various policy evaluation and policy gradient estimators based on discrete-time observations. Our results provide theoretical justification for the exploratory stochastic control framework in [H. Wang, T. Zariphopoulou, and X.Y. Zhou, J. Mach. Learn. Res., 21 (2020), pp. 1-34].</p></details> |  |

This enables compact and scalable codes for multi-stage, multi-step, and adaptive explicit time integration on distributed-memory parallel computers and on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The present implementation is based on extending OpenFPM's metaprogramming system to Odeint data types. This makes the time-integration methods from Odeint available in a concise template-expression language for numerical simulations distributed and parallelized using OpenFPM. We benchmark the present software for exponential and sigmoidal dynamics and present application examples to the 3D Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion problem and the "dam break" problem from fluid mechanics. We find a strong-scaling efficiency of 80% on up to 512 CPU cores and a five-fold speedup on a single GPU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-o1: Time-Series Forecasting Needs Transformed Label Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17847v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training time-series forecast models presents unique challenges in designing effective learning objectives. Existing methods predominantly utilize the temporal mean squared error, which faces two critical challenges: (1) label autocorrelation, which leads to bias from the label sequence likelihood; (2) excessive amount of tasks, which increases with the forecast horizon and complicates optimization. To address these challenges, we propose Time-o1, a transformation-augmented learning objective tailored for time-series forecasting. The central idea is to transform the label sequence into decorrelated components with discriminated significance. Models are then trained to align the most significant components, thereby effectively mitigating label autocorrelation and reducing task amount. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-o1 achieves state-of-the-art performance and is compatible with various forecast models.

| **[Moon: A Modality Conversion-based Efficient Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01970v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection identifies abnormal patterns where each timestamp contains multiple variables. Existing MTS anomaly detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based, prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time series data into image representations, capturing relationships across variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uniform-in-time convergence bounds for Persistent Contrastive Divergence Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01944v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a continuous-time formulation of persistent contrastive divergence (PCD) for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of unnormalised densities. Our approach expresses PCD as a coupled, multiscale system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which perform optimisation of the parameter and sampling of the associated parametrised density, simultaneously. From this novel formulation, we are able to derive explicit bounds for the error between the PCD iterates and the MLE solution for the model parameter. This is made possible by deriving uniform-in-time (UiT) bounds for the difference in moments between the multiscale system and the averaged regime. An efficient implementation of the continuous-time scheme is introduced, leveraging a class of explicit, stable intregators, stochastic orthogonal Runge-Kutta Chebyshev (S-ROCK), for which we provide explicit error estimates in the long-time regime. This leads to a novel method for training energy-based models (EBMs) with explicit error guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Approach for Estimating Largest Lyapunov Exponents in One-Dimensional Chaotic Time Series Using Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04868v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and quantifying chaos from data remains challenging. We present a data-driven method for estimating the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) from one-dimensional chaotic time series using machine learning. A predictor is trained to produce out-of-sample, multi-horizon forecasts; the LLE is then inferred from the exponential growth of the geometrically averaged forecast error (GMAE) across the horizon, which serves as a proxy for trajectory divergence. We validate the approach on four canonical 1D maps-logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev-achieving R2pos > 0.99 against reference LLE curves with series as short as M = 450. Among baselines, KNN yields the closest fits (KNN-R comparable; RF larger deviations). By design the estimator targets positive exponents: in periodic/stable regimes it returns values indistinguishable from zero. Noise robustness is assessed by adding zero-mean white measurement noise and summarizing performance versus the average SNR over parameter sweeps: accuracy saturates for SNRm > 30 dB and collapses below 27 dB, a conservative sensor-level benchmark. The method is simple, computationally efficient, and model-agnostic, requiring only stationarity and the presence of a dominant positive exponent. It offers a practical route to LLE estimation in experimental settings where only scalar time-series measurements are available, with extensions to higher-dimensional and irregularly sampled data left for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 2 Tables, 14 Equations</p></details> |
| **[OpenTSLM: Time-Series Language Models for Reasoning over Multivariate Medical Text- and Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02410v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications. Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models (TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt, models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR, compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even 1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences, while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA. To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models open-source.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wasserstein multivariate auto-regressive models for modeling distributional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05442v6)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is focused on the statistical analysis of data consisting of a collection of multiple series of probability measures that are indexed by distinct time instants and supported over a bounded interval of the real line. By modeling these time-dependent probability measures as random objects in the Wasserstein space, we propose a new auto-regressive model for the statistical analysis of multivariate distributional time series. Using the theory of iterated random function systems, results on the second order stationarity of the solution of such a model are provided. We also propose a consistent estimator for the auto-regressive coefficients of this model. Due to the simplex constraints that we impose on the model coefficients, the proposed estimator that is learned under these constraints, naturally has a sparse structure. The sparsity allows the application of the proposed model in learning a graph of temporal dependency from multivariate distributional time series. We explore the numerical performances of our estimation procedure using simulated data. To shed some light on the benefits of our approach for real data analysis, we also apply this methodology to two data sets, respectively made of observations from age distribution in different countries and those from the bike sharing network in Paris.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Foundational are Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00742v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models are designed to serve as versatile embedding machines, with strong zero shot capabilities and superior generalization performance when fine-tuned on diverse downstream tasks. While this is largely true for language and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on. Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results, relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller, dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Recent Advances in Time Series Foundation Models (BERT2S)</p></details> |

However, their robustness to continual adaptation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental stability-plasticity dilemma.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics for long-time simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01788v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work focuses on learning non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics from data, where long-term predictions require the preservation of structure both in the learned model and in numerical schemes. Previous research focused on either facet, respectively with a potential-based architecture and with degenerate variational integrators, but new issues arise when combining both. In experiments, the learnt model is sometimes numerically unstable due to the gauge dependency of the scheme, rendering long-time simulations impossible. In this paper, we identify this problem and propose two different training strategies to address it, either by directly learning the vector field or by learning a time-discrete dynamics through the scheme. Several numerical test cases assess the ability of the methods to learn complex physical dynamics, like the guiding center from gyrokinetic plasma physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[IndexNet: Timestamp and Variable-Aware Modeling for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23813v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE). Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite-Time Bounds for Distributionally Robust TD Learning with Linear Function Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01721v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL) focuses on designing policies that achieve good performance under model uncertainties. In particular, we are interested in maximizing the worst-case long-term discounted reward, where the data for RL comes from a nominal model while the deployed environment can deviate from the nominal model within a prescribed uncertainty set. Existing convergence guarantees for robust temporal-difference (TD) learning for policy evaluation are limited to tabular MDPs or are dependent on restrictive discount-factor assumptions when function approximation is used. We present the first robust TD learning with linear function approximation, where robustness is measured with respect to the total-variation distance and Wasserstein-l distance uncertainty set. Additionally, our algorithm is both model-free and does not require generative access to the MDP. Our algorithm combines a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update with an outer-loop target-network update. We establish an $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate value estimate. Our results close a key gap between the empirical success of robust RL algorithms and the non-asymptotic guarantees enjoyed by their non-robust counterparts. The key ideas in the paper also extend in a relatively straightforward fashion to robust Q-learning with function approximation.</p></details> | Preprint. 32 Pages |

When considering 51 distinct particle sizes, these curves form a high-dimensional functional time series observed over equally spaced and densely sampled grids. While high dimensionality poses statistical challenges due to the curse of dimensionality, it also offers a rich source of information that enables detailed analysis of temporal variation across short time intervals for all particle sizes. To model this complexity, we propose a multilevel functional time series framework incorporating a functional factor model to facilitate one-day-ahead forecasting. To quantify forecast uncertainty, we develop a calibration approach and a split conformal prediction approach to construct prediction intervals. Both approaches are designed to minimise the absolute difference between empirical and nominal coverage probabilities using a validation dataset. Furthermore, to improve forecast accuracy as new intraday data become available, we implement dynamic updating techniques for point and interval forecasts. The proposed methods are validated through an empirical application to hourly measurements of particulate matter in 51 size categories in London.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

This paper establishes a novel theoretical framework for time-optimal control of controllable linear systems with a single input, proposing the augmented switching law (ASL) that represents the input control and the feasibility in a compact form. Given a feasible trajectory, the perturbed trajectory under the constraints of ASL is guaranteed to be feasible, resulting in a novel state-centric necessary condition without dependence on costate information. A first-order necessary condition is proposed that the Jacobian matrix of the ASL is not of full row rank, which also results in a potential approach to optimizing a given feasible trajectory with the preservation of arc structures. The proposed necessary condition is applied to high-order chain-of-integrator systems with full box constraints, contributing to some theoretical results challenging to reason by costate-based conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE TAC</p></details> |

Two major families of methods fail in distinct ways: (i) imitation learning (IL) is reactive but lacks compositional generalization, as monolithic policies do not decide which skill to reuse when scenes change; (ii) classical task-and-motion planning (TAMP) offers compositionality but has prohibitive planning latency, preventing real-time failure recovery. We introduce SymSkill, a unified learning framework that combines the benefits of IL and TAMP, allowing compositional generalization and failure recovery in real-time. Offline, SymSkill jointly learns predicates, operators, and skills directly from unlabeled and unsegmented demonstrations. At execution time, upon specifying a conjunction of one or more learned predicates, SymSkill uses a symbolic planner to compose and reorder learned skills to achieve the symbolic goals, while performing recovery at both the motion and symbolic levels in real time. Coupled with a compliant controller, SymSkill enables safe and uninterrupted execution under human and environmental disturbances. In RoboCasa simulation, SymSkill can execute 12 single-step tasks with 85% success rate. Without additional data, it composes these skills into multi-step plans requiring up to 6 skill recompositions, recovering robustly from execution failures. On a real Franka robot, we demonstrate SymSkill, learning from 5 minutes of unsegmented and unlabeled play data, is capable of performing multiple tasks simply by goal specifications.

Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings. Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Reward Models for Multi-Domain Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00492v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reliability of large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling is often assessed with \emph{external verifiers} or \emph{reward models} that distinguish correct reasoning from flawed logic. Prior work generally assumes that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants, discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM (\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories, including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows, and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment. We publicly release our code, datasets, and checkpoints at \href{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}{\underline{\small\texttt{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}}} to facilitate future research in multi-domain settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing online planar mapping approaches struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency: direct depth image segmentation from specific sensors suffers from poor temporal integration, height map-based methods cannot represent complex 3D structures like overhangs, and voxel-based plane segmentation remains unexplored for real-time applications. To address these limitations, we develop a novel framework that integrates vertex-based connected component labeling with random sample consensus based plane detection and convex hull, leveraging GPU parallel computing to rapidly extract planar regions from point clouds accumulated in high-resolution 3D voxel maps. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fast and accurate 3D multi-plane segmentation at over 30 Hz update rate even at a resolution of 0.01 m, enabling the detected planes to be utilized in real time for locomotion tasks. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments in both simulated environments and physical legged robot platforms, confirming robust locomotion performance when considering 3D planar structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 12 figures, This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency, whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context. We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames, while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended sequences.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |

To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling (PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to +3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22% bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world applications.

Assuming independent samples, we make three theoretical contributions that improve upon the current state-of-the-art results: (i) we derive sharper high probability convergence guarantees that depend explicitly on the asymptotic variance and hold under weaker conditions than those adopted in the literature; (ii) we establish refined high-dimensional Berry-Esseen bounds over the class of convex sets, achieving faster rates than the best known results, and (iii) we propose and analyze a novel, computationally efficient online plug-in estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix. These results enable the construction of confidence regions and simultaneous confidence intervals for the linear parameters of the value function approximation, with guaranteed finite-sample coverage. We demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

Accurate predictions are important for applications including motion planning, tracking, human-robot interaction, and safety monitoring. In this paper, we exploit Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), which encode spatial or spatio-temporal motion patterns as environment features, to achieve LHMP for horizons of up to 60 seconds. We propose an MoD-informed LHMP framework that supports various types of MoDs and includes a ranking method to output the most likely predicted trajectory, improving practical utility in robotics. Further, a time-conditioned MoD is introduced to capture motion patterns that vary across different times of day. We evaluate MoD-LHMP instantiated with three types of MoDs.

We show that those temporal languages which do not pp-construct EVERYTHING (and thus by the classification are solvable in polynomial time) have, in fact, very limited expressive power as measured by the graphs and hypergraphs they can pp-interpret. This limitation yields many previously unknown algebraic consequences, while also providing new, uniform proofs for known invariance properties. In particular, we show that such temporal constraint languages admit $4$-ary pseudo-Siggers polymorphisms -- a result that sustains the possibility that the existence of such polymorphisms extends to the much broader context of the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture.</p></details> | 22 pages |

However, most existing works model spatial and temporal transitions separately, leading to misaligned representations of the same spatial-temporal key nodes. This misalignment introduces redundant information during fusion, increasing model uncertainty and reducing interpretability. To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced POI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over multiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs. The model employs a novel Disentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE), which first disentangles shared and private distributions using a multiplex spatial-temporal graph strategy. It then fuses the shared features via a Product of Experts (PoE) mechanism and denoises the private features through contrastive constraints. The model effectively captures the spatial-temporal transition representations of POIs while preserving the intrinsic correlation of their spatial-temporal relationships. Experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that our DiMuST significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>The o...</summary><p>The original paper has issues and has been restructured in the work; it is no longer suitable, so I am applying for withdrawal</p></details> |
| **[A Novel Unified Lightweight Temporal-Spatial Transformer Approach for Intrusion Detection in Drone Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02711v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing integration of drones across commercial, industrial, and civilian domains has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly due to the susceptibility of drone networks to a wide range of cyberattacks. Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability, efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource constrained environments in which drones operate. This paper proposes TSLT-Net, a novel lightweight and unified Temporal Spatial Transformer based intrusion detection system tailored specifically for drone networks. By leveraging self attention mechanisms, TSLT-Net effectively models both temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records, demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable parameters. These results establish TSLT-Net as an effective and scalable solution for real time drone cybersecurity, particularly suitable for deployment on edge devices in mission critical UAV systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 18 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

The factor can be specified as spatially varying or spatially constant, and the scale parameter incorporates scientifically relevant covariates (e.g., longitude, latitude, altitude), enabling flexible representation of geographic heterogeneity. To avoid the computational burden of the full censored likelihood, we design a Gibbs sampler that embeds amortized neural posterior estimation within each parameter block, yielding scalable inference with full posterior uncertainty for parameters, predictive quantiles, and return levels. Simulation studies demonstrate that the approach improves MCMC mixing and estimation accuracy relative to baseline specifications, particularly when using moderately more complex network architectures, while preserving heavy-tail behavior. We illustrate the methodology with daily precipitation in Guanacaste, Costa Rica, evaluating a suite of nested models and selecting the best-performing factor combination via out-of-sample diagnostics. The chosen specification reveals coherent spatial patterns in multi-year return periods and provides actionable information for infrastructure planning and climate-risk management in a tropical dry region strongly influenced by climatic factors. The proposed Gibbs scheme generalizes to other settings where parameters can be partitioned into inferentially homogeneous blocks and conditionals learned via amortized, likelihood-free methods.</p></details> |  |

Our model jointly optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3) identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised, and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs 0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67). Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants (GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63, AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters and identifies salient time windows that align with changes in sleep regularity, yielding clinically interpretable explanations of risk.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, Accepted NeurIPS (TS4H Workshop) 2025, non-camera-ready version)</p></details> |

To avoid placing distributional assumptions on the data, in recent years the conformal prediction method has been a popular approach for predictive inference, since it provides distribution-free coverage for any iid or exchangeable data distribution. However, in the time series setting, the strong empirical performance of conformal prediction methods is not well understood, since even short-range temporal dependence is a strong violation of the exchangeability assumption. Using predictors with "memory" -- i.e., predictors that utilize past observations, such as autoregressive models -- further exacerbates this problem. In this work, we examine the theoretical properties of split conformal prediction in the time series setting, including the case where predictors may have memory. Our results bound the loss of coverage of these methods in terms of a new "switch coefficient", measuring the extent to which temporal dependence within the time series creates violations of exchangeability. Our characterization of the coverage probability is sharp over the class of stationary, $\beta$-mixing processes. Along the way, we introduce tools that may prove useful in analyzing other predictive inference methods for dependent data.</p></details> | 22 pages |

However, these models frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications, including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as action and audio-aligned generation.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Temporal Overlapping Prediction: A Self-supervised Pre-training Method for LiDAR Moving Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07167v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moving object segmentation (MOS) on LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous systems like self-driving vehicles. Previous supervised approaches rely heavily on costly manual annotations, while LiDAR sequences naturally capture temporal motion cues that can be leveraged for self-supervised learning. In this paper, we propose Temporal Overlapping Prediction (TOP), a self-supervised pre-training method that alleviate the labeling burden for MOS. TOP explores the temporal overlapping points that commonly observed by current and adjacent scans, and learns spatiotemporal representations by predicting the occupancy states of temporal overlapping points. Moreover, we utilize current occupancy reconstruction as an auxiliary pre-training objective, which enhances the current structural awareness of the model. We conduct extensive experiments and observe that the conventional metric Intersection-over-Union (IoU) shows strong bias to objects with more scanned points, which might neglect small or distant objects. To compensate for this bias, we introduce an additional metric called mIoU_obj to evaluate object-level performance. Experiments on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI show that TOPoutperforms both supervised training-from-scratch baseline and other self-supervised pre-training baselines by up to 28.77% relative improvement, demonstrating strong transferability across LiDAR setups and generalization to other tasks. Code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |

While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal temporal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings. Our work establishes multi-marginal Schr\"odinger bridges as a practical and principled approach for recovering hidden dynamics from static data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

Current solutions, whether traditional position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms, and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, conference paper</p></details> |
| **[Foremost, Fastest, Shortest: Temporal Graph Realization under Various Path Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01702v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we follow the current trend on temporal graph realization, where one is given a property P and the goal is to determine whether there is a temporal graph, that is, a graph where the edge set changes over time, with property P . We consider the problems where as property P , we are given a prescribed matrix for the duration, length, or earliest arrival time of pairwise temporal paths. That is, we are given a matrix D and ask whether there is a temporal graph such that for any ordered pair of vertices (s, t), Ds,t equals the duration (length, or earliest arrival time, respectively) of any temporal path from s to t minimizing that specific temporal path metric. For shortest and earliest arrival temporal paths, we are the first to consider these problems as far as we know. We analyze these problems for many settings like: strict and non-strict paths, periodic and non-periodic temporal graphs, and limited number of labels per edge (that is, limited occurrence number per edge over time). In contrast to all other path metrics, we show that for the earliest arrival times, we can achieve polynomial-time algorithms in periodic and non-periodic temporal graphs and for strict and and non-strict paths. However, the problem becomes NP-hard when the matrix does not contain a single integer but a set or range of possible allowed values. As we show, the problem can still be solved efficiently in this scenario, when the number of entries with more than one value is small, that is, we develop an FPT-algorithm for the number of such entries. For the setting of fastest paths, we achieve new hardness results that answers an open question by Klobas, Mertzios, Molter, and Spirakis [Theor. Comput. Sci. '25] about the parameterized complexity of the problem with respect to the vertex cover number and significantly improves over a previous hardness result for the feedback vertex set number. When considering shortest paths, we show that the periodic versions are polynomial-time solvable whereas the non-periodic versions become NP-hard.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting the Ionosphere from Sparse GNSS Data with Temporal-Fusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00631v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ionosphere critically influences Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations, but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices, and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as 3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.</p></details> |  |
| **[FTSCommDetector: Discovering Behavioral Communities through Temporal Synchronization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00014v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Why do trillion-dollar tech giants AAPL and MSFT diverge into different response patterns during market disruptions despite identical sector classifications? This paradox reveals a fundamental limitation: traditional community detection methods fail to capture synchronization-desynchronization patterns where entities move independently yet align during critical moments. To this end, we introduce FTSCommDetector, implementing our Temporal Coherence Architecture (TCA) to discover similar and dissimilar communities in continuous multivariate time series. Unlike existing methods that process each timestamp independently, causing unstable community assignments and missing evolving relationships, our approach maintains coherence through dual-scale encoding and static topology with dynamic attention. Furthermore, we establish information-theoretic foundations demonstrating how scale separation maximizes complementary information and introduce Normalized Temporal Profiles (NTP) for scale-invariant evaluation. As a result, FTSCommDetector achieves consistent improvements across four diverse financial markets (SP100, SP500, SP1000, Nikkei 225), with gains ranging from 3.5% to 11.1% over the strongest baselines. The method demonstrates remarkable robustness with only 2% performance variation across window sizes from 60 to 120 days, making dataset-specific tuning unnecessary, providing practical insights for portfolio construction and risk management.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeGazer: Temporal Modeling of Predictive Gaze Stabilization for AR Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01561v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaze stabilization is critical for enabling fluid, accurate, and efficient interaction in immersive augmented reality (AR) environments, particularly during task-oriented visual behaviors. However, fixation sequences captured in active gaze tasks often exhibit irregular dispersion and systematic deviations from target locations, a variability primarily caused by the combined effects of human oculomotor physiology, insufficient AR headset tracking and calibration accuracy, and environmental disturbances, undermining interaction performance and visual engagement. To address this issue, we propose TimeGazer, which reformulates gaze stabilization as a sequence-to-sequence temporal regression problem, predicting idealized fixation trajectories for the target-fixation phase from historical gaze dynamics in the search phase. We present a synthetic data generation and blending strategy that produces spatially concentrated, target-centered fixation references aligned with task objectives, substantially enriching the training space and enhancing model generalization. We train and evaluate TimeGazer on a hybrid dataset of real and augmented gaze sequences collected via Microsoft HoloLens 2 from 54 participants across multiple prediction horizons. Through the user study, statistical results demonstrate that TimeGazer significantly improves interaction accuracy and reduces completion time, confirming that temporal modeling of predictive gaze stabilization can strengthen attentional consistency and responsiveness in task-driven AR interaction. These findings highlight the broader potential of TimeGazer for advancing adaptive gaze-based interfaces and temporal modeling research in immersive systems.</p></details> |  |

However, its strict reliance on precise temporal synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce DejaVu, an attack that exploits the in-vehicular network and induces delays across sensor streams to create subtle temporal misalignments, severely degrading downstream MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different models and datasets reveals the sensors' task-specific imbalanced sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs, while object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to 88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) for car drops by 73%. We further demonstrated two attack scenarios using an automotive Ethernet testbed for hardware-in-the-loop validation and the Autoware stack for end-to-end AD simulation, demonstrating the feasibility of the DejaVu attack and its severe impact, such as collisions and phantom braking.</p></details> | 15 pages |

While standard architectures like ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT), a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing for reviewing</p></details> |

Such patterns can be revealed by analyzing communities formed by nodes, which in turn can be effectively modeled through temporal $k$-cores. This paper introduces a novel decentralized and incremental algorithm for computing the core decomposition of temporal networks. Decentralized solutions leverage the ability of network nodes to communicate and coordinate locally, addressing complex problems in a scalable, adaptive, and timely manner. By leveraging previously computed coreness values, our approach significantly reduces the activation of nodes and the volume of message exchanges when the network changes over time. This enables scalability with only a minimal trade-off in precision. Experimental evaluations on large real-world networks under varying levels of dynamism demonstrate the efficiency of our solution compared to a state-of-the-art approach, particularly in terms of active nodes, communication overhead, and convergence speed.</p></details> |  |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from exogenous stochastic processes. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |
| **[GUI-KV: Efficient GUI Agents via KV Cache with Spatio-Temporal Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00536v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on vision-language models have emerged as a promising approach to automate human-computer workflows. However, they also face the inefficiency challenge as they process long sequences of high-resolution screenshots and solving long-horizon tasks, making inference slow, costly and memory-bound. While key-value (KV) caching can mitigate this, storing the full cache is prohibitive for image-heavy contexts. Existing cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they do not account for the spatial and temporal redundancy of GUIs. In this work, we first analyze attention patterns in GUI agent workloads and find that, unlike in natural images, attention sparsity is uniformly high across all transformer layers. This insight motivates a simple uniform budget allocation strategy, which we show empirically outperforms more complex layer-varying schemes. Building on this, we introduce GUI-KV, a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI agents that requires no retraining. GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: (i) spatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of hidden states to better preserve semantically important visual tokens, and (ii) temporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the current frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history. Across standard GUI agent benchmarks and models, GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets. Notably, in a 5-screenshot setting on the AgentNetBench benchmark, GUI-KV reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over the full-cache baseline. These results demonstrate that exploiting GUI-specific redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance.</p></details> |  |

However, existing generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this, we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. It encodes key physical processes -- vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0% over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and 7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.</p></details> |  |

For rasterization and other tasks, it is often necessary to extract a mesh that represents the shape. Unbounded scenes with long-range camera trajectories, such as flying through a forest, pose a unique challenge for mesh extraction. A single static mesh representing all the geometric detail necessary for the full camera path can be prohibitively large. Therefore, independent meshes can be extracted for different camera views, but this approach may lead to popping artifacts during transitions. We propose a temporally coherent method for extracting meshes suitable for long-range camera trajectories in unbounded scenes represented by an occupancy function. The key idea is to perform 4D mesh extraction using a new spacetime tree structure called a binary-octree. Experiments show that, compared to existing baseline methods, our method offers superior visual consistency at a comparable cost.

In this framework, temporal predicates are encoded as polyhedron constraints on each edge of the network flow, instead of as constraints between the nodes as in the traditional Logic Tree formulation. Synthesized with Dynamic Network Flows, Logic Network Flows render a tighter convex relaxation compared to Logic Trees derived from these STL specifications. Our formulation is evaluated on several multi-robot motion planning case studies. Empirical results demonstrate that our formulation outperforms Logic Tree formulation in terms of computation time for several planning problems. As the problem size scales up, our method still discovers better lower and upper bounds by exploring fewer number of nodes during the branch-and-bound process, although this comes at the cost of increased computational load for each node when exploring branches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |

Signal Temporal Logic (STL) offers a powerful and expressive language for specifying such tasks, but its non-Markovian nature and inherent sparse reward make it difficult to be solved via standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Prior RL approaches focus only on limited STL fragments or use STL robustness scores as sparse terminal rewards. In this paper, we propose TGPO, Temporal Grounded Policy Optimization, to solve general STL tasks. TGPO decomposes STL into timed subgoals and invariant constraints and provides a hierarchical framework to tackle the problem. The high-level component of TGPO proposes concrete time allocations for these subgoals, and the low-level time-conditioned policy learns to achieve the sequenced subgoals using a dense, stage-wise reward signal. During inference, we sample various time allocations and select the most promising assignment for the policy network to rollout the solution trajectory. To foster efficient policy learning for complex STL with multiple subgoals, we leverage the learned critic to guide the high-level temporal search via Metropolis-Hastings sampling, focusing exploration on temporally feasible solutions. We conduct experiments on five environments, ranging from low-dimensional navigation to manipulation, drone, and quadrupedal locomotion. Under a wide range of STL tasks, TGPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (especially for high-dimensional and long-horizon cases), with an average of 31.6% improvement in task success rate compared to the best baseline. The code will be available at https://github.com/mengyuest/TGPO</p></details> |  |

One promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos, including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10 tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency. Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward signals from diverse video sources.</p></details> |  |
| **[STaR-Attack: A Spatio-Temporal and Narrative Reasoning Attack Framework for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26473v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically, our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability. STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates, forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety alignments in UMMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-temporal crack segmentation in concrete structures using deep learning approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04620v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cracks are among the earliest indicators of deterioration in concrete structures. Early automatic detection of these cracks can significantly extend the lifespan of critical infrastructures, such as bridges, buildings, and tunnels, while simultaneously reducing maintenance costs and facilitating efficient structural health monitoring. This study investigates whether leveraging multi-temporal data for crack segmentation can enhance segmentation quality. Therefore, we compare a Swin UNETR trained on multi-temporal data with a U-Net trained on mono-temporal data to assess the effect of temporal information compared with conventional single-epoch approaches. To this end, a multi-temporal dataset comprising 1356 images, each with 32 sequential crack propagation images, was created. After training the models, experiments were conducted to analyze their generalization ability, temporal consistency, and segmentation quality. The multi-temporal approach consistently outperformed its mono-temporal counterpart, achieving an IoU of $82.72\%$ and a F1-score of $90.54\%$, representing a significant improvement over the mono-temporal model's IoU of $76.69\%$ and F1-score of $86.18\%$, despite requiring only half of the trainable parameters. The multi-temporal model also displayed a more consistent segmentation quality, with reduced noise and fewer errors. These results suggest that temporal information significantly enhances the performance of segmentation models, offering a promising solution for improved crack detection and the long-term monitoring of concrete structures, even with limited sequential data.</p></details> |  |

However, their capacity of temporal dynamics, including the ability to manage timing, tempo and simultaneous speaking, remains a critical and unevaluated challenge for conversational fluency. To address this gap, we introduce the Game-Time Benchmark, a framework to systematically assess these temporal capabilities. Inspired by how humans learn a language through language activities, Game-Time consists of basic instruction-following tasks and advanced tasks with temporal constraints, such as tempo adherence and synchronized responses. Our evaluation of diverse SLM architectures reveals a clear performance disparity: while state-of-the-art models handle basic tasks well, many contemporary systems still struggle with fundamental instruction-following. More critically, nearly all models degrade substantially under temporal constraints, exposing persistent weaknesses in time awareness and full-duplex interaction. The Game-Time Benchmark provides a foundation for guiding future research toward more temporally-aware conversational AI. Demos and datasets are available on our project website https://ga642381.github.io/Game-Time.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[TimeScope: Towards Task-Oriented Temporal Grounding In Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26360v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem, Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description. Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new challenging problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[EnScale: Temporally-consistent multivariate generative downscaling via proper scoring rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26258v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The practical use of future climate projections from global circulation models (GCMs) is often limited by their coarse spatial resolution, requiring downscaling to generate high-resolution data. Regional climate models (RCMs) provide this refinement, but are computationally expensive. To address this issue, machine learning models can learn the downscaling function, mapping coarse GCM outputs to high-resolution fields. Among these, generative approaches aim to capture the full conditional distribution of RCM data given coarse-scale GCM data, which is characterized by large variability and thus challenging to model accurately. We introduce EnScale, a generative machine learning framework that emulates the full GCM-to-RCM map by training on multiple pairs of GCM and corresponding RCM data. It first adjusts large-scale mismatches between GCM and coarsened RCM data, followed by a super-resolution step to generate high-resolution fields. Both steps employ generative models optimized with the energy score, a proper scoring rule. Compared to state-of-the-art ML downscaling approaches, our setup reduces computational cost by about one order of magnitude. EnScale jointly emulates multiple variables -- temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind -- spatially consistent over an area in Central Europe. In addition, we propose a variant EnScale-t that enables temporally consistent downscaling. We establish a comprehensive evaluation framework across various categories including calibration, spatial structure, extremes, and multivariate dependencies. Comparison with diverse benchmarks demonstrates EnScale's strong performance and computational efficiency. EnScale offers a promising approach for accurate and temporally consistent RCM emulation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive latent representations, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windowed temporal fusion using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains modular modality fusion while substantially enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance for downstream SLAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Up Temporal Domain Generalization via Temporal Experts Averaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26045v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging (TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes. Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5 models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69% while being up to 60x more efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 main</p></details> |
| **[BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories under Spatio-Temporal Vector Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26005v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a formal active learning methodology for guiding the placement of Lagrangian observers to infer time-dependent vector fields -- a key task in oceanography, marine science, and ocean engineering -- using a physics-informed spatio-temporal Gaussian process surrogate model. The majority of existing placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Behavioural Classification in C. elegans: a Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00086v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 1mm roundworm C. elegans is a model organism used in many sub-areas of biology to investigate different types of biological processes. In order to complement the n-vivo analysis with computer-based investigations, several methods have been proposed to simulate the worm behaviour. These methods extract discrete behavioural units from the flow of the worm movements using different types of tracking techniques. Nevertheless, these techniques require a clear view of the entire worm body, which is not always achievable. For example, this happens in high density worm conditions, which are particularly informative to understand the influence of the social context on the single worm behaviour. In this paper, we illustrate and evaluate a method to extract behavioural units from recordings of C. elegans movements which do not necessarily require a clear view of the entire worm body. Moreover, the behavioural units are defined by an unsupervised automatic pipeline which frees the process from predefined assumptions that inevitably bias the behavioural analysis. The behavioural units resulting from the automatic method are interpreted by comparing them with hand-designed behavioural units. The effectiveness of the automatic method is evaluated by measuring the extent to which the movement of a simulated worm, with an agent-based model, matches the movement of a natural worm. Our results indicate that spatio-temporal locomotory patterns emerge even from single point worm tracking. Moreover, we show that such patterns represent a fundamental aspect of the behavioural classification process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal-Network Point Processes for Modeling Crime Events with Landmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10882v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-exciting point processes are widely used to model the contagious effects of crime events living within continuous geographic space, using their occurrence time and locations. However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |

Traditional spot trading suffers from negotiation delays and high energy costs, while conventional futures trading struggles to adapt to the dynamic, uncertain UAV-edge environment. To address these challenges, we propose PAST (pilot-and-adaptive stable trading), a novel framework for edge-assisted UAV networks with spatio-temporal dynamism. PAST integrates two complementary mechanisms: PilotAO (pilot trading agreements with overbooking), a risk-aware, overbooking-enabled early-stage decision-making module that establishes long-term, mutually beneficial agreements and boosts resource utilization; and AdaptAO (adaptive trading agreements with overbooking rate update), an intelligent adaptation module that dynamically updates agreements and overbooking rates based on UAV mobility, supply-demand variations, and agreement performance. Together, these mechanisms enable both stability and flexibility, guaranteeing individual rationality, strong stability, competitive equilibrium, and weak Pareto optimality. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that PAST consistently outperforms benchmark methods in decision-making overhead, task completion latency, resource utilization, and social welfare. By combining predictive planning with real-time adjustments, PAST offers a valuable reference on robust and adaptive practice for improving low-altitude mission performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guiding Mixture-of-Experts with Temporal Multimodal Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25678v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become pivotal for large-scale multimodal models. However, their routing mechanisms typically overlook the informative, time-varying interaction dynamics between modalities. This limitation hinders expert specialization, as the model cannot explicitly leverage intrinsic modality relationships for effective reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel framework that guides MoE routing using quantified temporal interaction. A multimodal interaction-aware router learns to dispatch tokens to experts based on the nature of their interactions. This dynamic routing encourages experts to acquire generalizable interaction-processing skills rather than merely learning task-specific features. Our framework builds on a new formulation of temporal multimodal interaction dynamics, which are used to guide expert routing. We first demonstrate that these temporal multimodal interactions reveal meaningful patterns across applications, and then show how they can be leveraged to improve both the design and performance of MoE-based models. Comprehensive experiments on challenging multimodal benchmarks validate our approach, demonstrating both enhanced performance and improved interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Conformal Prediction for Signal Temporal Logic Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25473v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term. Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Vulnerabilities in Temporal Graph Neural Networks via Strategic High-Impact Assaults](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25418v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have become indispensable for analyzing dynamic graphs in critical applications such as social networks, communication systems, and financial networks. However, the robustness of TGNNs against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic, easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection (to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT) demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in current STDG models and underscore the urgent need for robust defenses that account for both structural and temporal dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[TemMed-Bench: Evaluating Temporal Medical Image Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25143v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit. However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice, where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images. TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain. We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of 2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address this challenge.</p></details> |  |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Representations for Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13113v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In classical AI, perception relies on learning state-based representations, while planning, which can be thought of as temporal reasoning over action sequences, is typically achieved through search. We study whether such reasoning can instead emerge from representations that capture both perceptual and temporal structure. We show that standard temporal contrastive learning, despite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure due to its reliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Combinatorial Representations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative sampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate temporal reasoning. CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex temporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik's Cube. In particular, for the Rubik's Cube, CRTR learns representations that generalize across all initial states and allow it to solve the puzzle using fewer search steps than BestFS, though with longer solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first method that efficiently solves arbitrary Cube states using only learned representations, without relying on an external search algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, Project website: https://princeton-rl.github.io/CRTR/</p></details> |

However, current unsupervised SNNs predominantly employ shallow architectures or localized plasticity rules, limiting their ability to model long-range temporal dependencies and maintain temporal feature consistency. This results in semantically unstable representations, thereby impeding the development of deep unsupervised SNNs for large-scale temporal video data. We propose PredNext, which explicitly models temporal relationships through cross-view future Step Prediction and Clip Prediction. This plug-and-play module seamlessly integrates with diverse self-supervised objectives. We firstly establish standard benchmarks for SNN self-supervised learning on UCF101, HMDB51, and MiniKinetics, which are substantially larger than conventional DVS datasets. PredNext delivers significant performance improvements across different tasks and self-supervised methods. PredNext achieves performance comparable to ImageNet-pretrained supervised weights through unsupervised training solely on UCF101. Additional experiments demonstrate that PredNext, distinct from forced consistency constraints, substantially improves temporal feature consistency while enhancing network generalization capabilities. This work provides a effective foundation for unsupervised deep SNNs on large-scale temporal video data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Double Machine Learning Based Structure Identification from Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06012v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning the causes of time-series data is a fundamental task in many applications, spanning from finance to earth sciences or bio-medical applications. Common approaches for this task are based on vector auto-regression, and they do not take into account unknown confounding between potential causes. However, in settings with many potential causes and noisy data, these approaches may be substantially biased. Furthermore, potential causes may be correlated in practical applications or even contain cycles. To address these challenges, we propose a new double machine learning based method for structure identification from temporal data (DR-SIT). We provide theoretical guarantees, showing that our method asymptotically recovers the true underlying causal structure. Our analysis extends to cases where the potential causes have cycles, and they may even be confounded. We further perform extensive experiments to showcase the superior performance of our method.

Current neural network approaches to MTPP inference rely on training separate, specialized models for each target system. We pursue a radically different approach: drawing on amortized inference and in-context learning, we pretrain a deep neural network to infer, in-context, the conditional intensity functions of event histories from a context defined by sets of event sequences. Pretraining is performed on a large synthetic dataset of MTPPs sampled from a broad distribution of Hawkes processes. Once pretrained, our Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) can estimate MTPPs from real-world data without any additional training, or be rapidly finetuned to target systems. Experiments show that this amortized approach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction across common benchmark datasets. Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials will soon be available online</p></details> |  |

Traditional analytics techniques rely on manual annotation or laboratory-based instrumentation, which are time-consuming, costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of relevant kinetic variables requires a robust and contextually appropriate temporal segmentation. Considering the specific case of elite javelin-throw, we present a novel unsupervised framework for such a contextually aware segmentation, which applies the structured optimal transport (SOT) concept to augment the well-known Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN). This enables the identification of motion phase transitions without requiring expensive manual labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving 71.02% mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially higher than competing baselines. We also release a new dataset of 211 manually annotated professional javelin-throw videos with frame-level annotations, covering key biomechanical phases: approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the IEEE STAR Workshop 2025</p></details> |

However, existing reward models often lack temporal consistency, leading to ineffective policy updates and unstable RL training. We introduce TDRM, a method for learning smoother and more reliable reward models by minimizing temporal differences (TD) for training-time reinforcement learning and inference-time verification. Experiments show that TD-trained process reward models (PRMs) improve performance across Best-of-N (up to 6.6%) and tree-search (up to 23.7%) settings. When combined with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), TD-trained PRMs lead to more data-efficient RL -- achieving comparable performance with just 2.5k data to what baseline methods require 50.1k data to attain -- and yield higher-quality language model policies in 8 model variants (5 series), e.g., Qwen2.5-(0.5B, 1,5B), GLM4-9B-0414, GLM-Z1-9B-0414, Qwen2.5-Math-(1.5B, 7B), and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-(1.5B, 7B).

This sole focus on efficacy has steered development of large-scale models that require massive resources, and results in considerable carbon footprint across the model life-cycle. In this work, we explore how physics inductive biases can offer useful trade-offs between model efficacy and model efficiency (compute, energy, and carbon). We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for spatio-temporal forecasting. Our experiments show that incorporating physics inductive biases offer a principled way to improve the efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of machine learning models. We argue that model efficiency, along with model efficacy, should become a core consideration driving machine learning model development and deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code available at https://github.com/sophiawilson18/FlowMatching</p></details> |
| **[Functional Complexity-adaptive Temporal Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06164v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor decomposition is a fundamental tool for analyzing multi-dimensional data by learning low-rank factors to represent high-order interactions. While recent works on temporal tensor decomposition have made significant progress by incorporating continuous timestamps in latent factors, they still struggle with general tensor data with continuous indexes not only in the temporal mode but also in other modes, such as spatial coordinates in climate data. Moreover, the challenge of self-adapting model complexity is largely unexplored in functional temporal tensor models, with existing methods being inapplicable in this setting. To address these limitations, we propose functional \underline{C}omplexity-\underline{A}daptive \underline{T}emporal \underline{T}ensor d\underline{E}composition (\textsc{Catte}). Our approach encodes continuous spatial indexes as learnable Fourier features and employs neural ODEs in latent space to learn the temporal trajectories of factors. To enable automatic adaptation of model complexity, we introduce a sparsity-inducing prior over the factor trajectories. We develop an efficient variational inference scheme with an analytical evidence lower bound, enabling sampling-free optimization. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that \textsc{Catte} not only reveals the underlying ranks of functional temporal tensors but also significantly outperforms existing methods in prediction performance and robustness against noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScatterAD: Temporal-Topological Scattering Mechanism for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24414v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However, traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series anomaly detection.

However, applying MTRL to robotics remains challenging due to the high cost of collecting diverse task data. To address this, we propose MT-L\'evy, a novel exploration strategy that enhances sample efficiency in MTRL environments by combining behavior sharing across tasks with temporally extended exploration inspired by L\'evy flight. MT-L\'evy leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration towards key states, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on task success ratios. This approach enables more efficient state-space coverage, even in complex robotics environments. Empirical results demonstrate that MT-L\'evy significantly improves exploration and sample efficiency, supported by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies further highlight the contribution of each component, showing that combining behavior sharing with adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality of MTRL in robotics applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[Reversed in Time: A Novel Temporal-Emphasized Benchmark for Cross-Modal Video-Text Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19178v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-modal (e.g. image-text, video-text) retrieval is an important task in information retrieval and multimodal vision-language understanding field. Temporal understanding makes video-text retrieval more challenging than image-text retrieval. However, we find that the widely used video-text benchmarks have shortcomings in comprehensively assessing abilities of models, especially in temporal understanding, causing large-scale image-text pre-trained models can already achieve comparable zero-shot performance with video-text pre-trained models. In this paper, we introduce RTime, a novel temporal-emphasized video-text retrieval dataset. We first obtain videos of actions or events with significant temporality, and then reverse these videos to create harder negative samples. We then recruit annotators to judge the significance and reversibility of candidate videos, and write captions for qualified videos. We further adopt GPT-4 to extend more captions based on human-written captions. Our RTime dataset currently consists of 21k videos with 10 captions per video, totalling about 122 hours. Based on RTime, we propose three retrieval benchmark tasks: RTime-Origin, RTime-Hard, and RTime-Binary. We further enhance the use of harder-negatives in model training, and benchmark a variety of video-text models on RTime. Extensive experiment analysis proves that RTime indeed poses new and higher challenges to video-text retrieval. We release our RTime dataset https://github.com/qyr0403/Reversed-in-Time to further advance video-text retrieval and multimodal understanding research.</p></details> | ACMMM 2024 poster |
| **[Temporal Grounding as a Learning Signal for Referring Video Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11955v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment and track objects in videos based on natural language expressions, requiring precise alignment between visual content and textual queries. However, existing methods often suffer from semantic misalignment, largely due to indiscriminate frame sampling and supervision of all visible objects during training -- regardless of their actual relevance to the expression. We identify the core problem as the absence of an explicit temporal learning signal in conventional training paradigms. To address this, we introduce MeViS-M, a dataset built upon the challenging MeViS benchmark, where we manually annotate temporal spans when each object is referred to by the expression. These annotations provide a direct, semantically grounded supervision signal that was previously missing. To leverage this signal, we propose Temporally Grounded Learning (TGL), a novel learning framework that directly incorporates temporal grounding into the training process. Within this frame- work, we introduce two key strategies. First, Moment-guided Dual-path Propagation (MDP) improves both grounding and tracking by decoupling language-guided segmentation for relevant moments from language-agnostic propagation for others. Second, Object-level Selective Supervision (OSS) supervises only the objects temporally aligned with the expression in each training clip, thereby reducing semantic noise and reinforcing language-conditioned learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TGL framework effectively leverages temporal signal to establish a new state-of-the-art on the challenging MeViS benchmark. We will make our code and the MeViS-M dataset publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://seung-hun-lee.github.io/projects/TGL/</p></details> |

However, we find that typical strategies designed to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2) internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches mostly rely on static or attention-only architectures, which struggle to model fine-grained temporal dynamics. We propose TGT, a Transformer framework equipped with a temporal gating module that conditions hidden representations on the hour-of-day. Unlike conventional time embeddings, temporal gating adaptively rescales feature dimensions in a time-aware manner, working orthogonally to self-attention and strengthening temporal sensitivity. TGT further incorporates a context-aware encoder that integrates session sequences and user profiles into a unified representation. Experiments on two real-world datasets, Tsinghua App Usage and LSApp, demonstrate that TGT significantly outperforms 15 competitive baselines, achieving notable gains in HR@1 and maintaining robustness under cold-start scenarios. Beyond accuracy, analysis of gating vectors uncovers interpretable daily usage rhythms, showing that TGT learns human-consistent patterns of app behavior. These results establish TGT as both a powerful and interpretable framework for time-aware app usage prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAIR: Addressing Stage Misalignment through Temporal-Aligned Preference Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23802v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses complex reward engineering by learning rewards directly from human preferences, enabling better alignment with human intentions. However, its effectiveness in multi-stage tasks, where agents sequentially perform sub-tasks (e.g., navigation, grasping), is limited by stage misalignment: Comparing segments from mismatched stages, such as movement versus manipulation, results in uninformative feedback, thus hindering policy learning. In this paper, we validate the stage misalignment issue through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. To address this issue, we propose STage-AlIgned Reward learning (STAIR), which first learns a stage approximation based on temporal distance, then prioritizes comparisons within the same stage. Temporal distance is learned via contrastive learning, which groups temporally close states into coherent stages, without predefined task knowledge, and adapts dynamically to policy changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate STAIR's superiority in multi-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks. Furthermore, human studies show that stages approximated by STAIR are consistent with human cognition, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating stage misalignment.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, existing studies on cultural understanding with vision-language models (VLMs) primarily emphasize geographic diversity, often overlooking the critical temporal dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hanfu-Bench, a novel, expert-curated multimodal dataset. Hanfu, a traditional garment spanning ancient Chinese dynasties, serves as a representative cultural heritage that reflects the profound temporal aspects of Chinese culture while remaining highly popular in Chinese contemporary society. Hanfu-Bench comprises two core tasks: cultural visual understanding and cultural image transcreation. The former task examines temporal-cultural feature recognition based on single- or multi-image inputs through multiple-choice visual question answering, while the latter focuses on transforming traditional attire into modern designs through cultural element inheritance and modern context adaptation. Our evaluation shows that closed VLMs perform comparably to non-experts on visual cutural understanding but fall short by 10% to human experts, while open VLMs lags further behind non-experts. For the transcreation task, multi-faceted human evaluation indicates that the best-performing model achieves a success rate of only 42%. Our benchmark provides an essential testbed, revealing significant challenges in this new direction of temporal cultural understanding and creative adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Cultu...</summary><p>Cultural Analysis, Cultural Visual Understanding, Cultural Image Transcreation.

Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Generalization: A Reality Check](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23487v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data. In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters (\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when evaluating claims of such generalization.</p></details> |  |

Yet capturing pore collapse, anomalous Hugoniot responses, and localized heating-phenomena that strongly influence asteroid deflection or fusion ignition has remained a major challenge despite recent advances in single-field and reduced representations. We introduce a multi-field spatio-temporal deep learning model (MSTM) that unifies seven coupled fields-pressure, density, temperature, energy, material distribution, and two velocity components into a single autoregressive surrogate. Trained on high-fidelity hydrocode data, MSTM captures nonlinear shock-driven dynamics across porous and architected configurations, achieving mean errors of 1.4% and 3.2% respectively, all while delivering over three orders of magnitude in speedup. This advance transforms problems once considered intractable into tractable design studies, establishing a practical framework for optimizing meso-structured materials in planetary impact mitigation and inertial fusion energy.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

Standard 2D spectrograms provide rich spectral features but compromise the phase information and temporal precision of the 1D waveform. We propose AudioFuse, an architecture that simultaneously learns from both complementary representations to classify PCGs. To mitigate the overfitting risk common in fusion models, we integrate a custom, wide-and-shallow Vision Transformer (ViT) for spectrograms with a shallow 1D CNN for raw waveforms. On the PhysioNet 2016 dataset, AudioFuse achieves a state-of-the-art competitive ROC-AUC of 0.8608 when trained from scratch, outperforming its spectrogram (0.8066) and waveform (0.8223) baselines. Moreover, it demonstrates superior robustness to domain shift on the challenging PASCAL dataset, maintaining an ROC-AUC of 0.7181 while the spectrogram baseline collapses (0.4873). Fusing complementary representations thus provides a strong inductive bias, enabling the creation of efficient, generalizable classifiers without requiring large-scale pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026.

We focus on interfacing these networks with event-based data to perform online spatiotemporal classification and detection with low latency. By virtue of using structured temporal kernels and event-based data, we have the freedom to vary the sample rate of the data along with the discretization step-size of the network without additional finetuning. We experimented with three event-based benchmarks and obtained state-of-the-art results on all three by large margins with significantly smaller memory and compute costs. We achieved: 1) 99.59% accuracy with 192K parameters on the DVS128 hand gesture recognition dataset and 100% with a small additional output filter; 2) 99.58% test accuracy with 277K parameters on the AIS 2024 eye tracking challenge; and 3) 0.556 mAP with 576k parameters on the PROPHESEE 1 Megapixel Automotive Detection Dataset.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |

Mechanistic interpretability tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling, instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework. Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points. Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Representing these instructions as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) enables planners to synthesize actionable plans. We introduce CoT-TL, a data-efficient in-context learning framework for translating natural language specifications into LTL representations. CoT-TL addresses the limitations of large language models, which typically rely on extensive fine-tuning data, by extending chain-of-thought reasoning and semantic roles to align with the requirements of formal logic creation. This approach enhances the transparency and rationale behind LTL generation, fostering user trust. CoT-TL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across three diverse datasets in low-data scenarios, outperforming existing methods without fine-tuning or intermediate translations. To improve reliability and minimize hallucinations, we incorporate model checking to validate the syntax of the generated LTL output. We further demonstrate CoT-TL's effectiveness through ablation studies and evaluations on unseen LTL structures and formulas in a new dataset. Finally, we validate CoT-TL's practicality by integrating it into a QuadCopter for multi-step drone planning based on natural language instructions.

To resolve these problems, we propose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism that reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a distinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each query via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this local adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength in capturing long-range dependencies. We then replace the vanilla attention mechanism in popular time-series Transformer frameworks (i.e., PatchTST and Timer) with TMOE, without extra structural modifications, yielding our specific version TimeExpert and general version TimeExpert-G. Extensive experiments on seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that TimeExpert and TimeExpert-G outperform state-of-the-art methods.

To address this, we introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility), a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies, thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost. We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a 5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time.

However, in dynamic remote scenes, transmission latency during bidirectional communication creates gaps between remote perceived states and operator intent, leading to command misunderstanding and incorrect execution. To mitigate this, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph (ST-OVSG), a representation that enriches open-vocabulary perception with temporal dynamics and lightweight latency annotations. ST-OVSG leverages LVLMs to construct open-vocabulary 3D object representations, and extends them into the temporal domain via Hungarian assignment with our temporal matching cost, yielding a unified spatio-temporal scene graph. A latency tag is embedded to enable LVLM planners to retrospectively query past scene states, thereby resolving local-remote state mismatches caused by transmission delays. To further reduce redundancy and highlight task-relevant cues, we propose a task-oriented subgraph filtering strategy that produces compact inputs for the planner. ST-OVSG generalizes to novel categories and enhances planning robustness against transmission latency without requiring fine-tuning. Experiments show that our method achieves 74 percent node accuracy on the Replica benchmark, outperforming ConceptGraph. Notably, in the latency-robustness experiment, the LVLM planner assisted by ST-OVSG achieved a planning success rate of 70.5 percent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Hybrid Temporal Computing Using Deterministic Summations for Ultra-Low-Power Accelerators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22999v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an accuracy-enhanced Hybrid Temporal Computing (E-HTC) framework for ultra-low-power hardware accelerators with deterministic additions. Inspired by the recently proposed HTC architecture, which leverages pulse-rate and temporal data encoding to reduce switching activity and energy consumption but loses accuracy due to its multiplexer (MUX)-based scaled addition, we propose two bitstream addition schemes: (1) an Exact Multiple-input Binary Accumulator (EMBA), which performs precise binary accumulation, and (2) a Deterministic Threshold-based Scaled Adder (DTSA), which employs threshold logic for scaled addition. These adders are integrated into a multiplier accumulator (MAC) unit supporting both unipolar and bipolar encodings. To validate the framework, we implement two accelerators: a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter and an 8-point Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)/iDCT engine. Results on a 4x4 MAC show that, in unipolar mode, E-HTC matches the RMSE of state-of-the-art Counter-Based Stochastic Computing (CBSC) MAC, improves accuracy by 94% over MUX-based HTC, and reduces power and area by 23% and 7% compared to MUX-based HTC and 64% and 74% compared to CBSC. In bipolar mode, E-HTC MAC achieves 2.09% RMSE -- an 83% improvement over MUX-based HTC -- and approaches CBSC's 1.40% RMSE with area and power savings of 28% and 43% vs. MUX-based HTC and about 76% vs. CBSC. In FIR experiments, both E-HTC variants yield PSNR gains of 3--5 dB (30--45% RMSE reduction) while saving 13% power and 3% area. For DCT/iDCT, E-HTC boosts PSNR by 10--13 dB (70--75% RMSE reduction) while saving area and power over both MUX- and CBSC-based designs.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Learning Temporal Saliency for Time Series Forecasting with Cross-Scale Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22839v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy. Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across datasets of varying complexity.</p></details> |  |

Both are fundamentally limited by the common challenge of modeling long-range temporal dynamics. To explore how to improve the performance of methods on both tasks simultaneously by enhancing long-range temporal understanding capabilities, we introduce TAMMs, the first unified framework designed to jointly perform TCD and FSIF within a single MLLM-diffusion architecture. TAMMs introduces two key innovations: Temporal Adaptation Modules (TAM) enhance frozen MLLM's ability to comprehend long-range dynamics, and Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism translates this change understanding into fine-grained generative control. This synergistic design makes the understanding from the TCD task to directly inform and improve the consistency of the FSIF task. Extensive experiments demonstrate TAMMs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art specialist baselines on both tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to The Fourteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2026).

In this paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among multiple predictions from a single SNN, SpikeMatch generates reliable pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on strongly-augmented ones, effectively mitigating confirmation bias by capturing discriminative features with limited labels. Experiments show that SpikeMatch outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various standard benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[PSTTS: A Plug-and-Play Token Selector for Efficient Event-based Spatio-temporal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22481v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba, and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements. Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3% on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be available.</p></details> |  |

Whereas existing corpora are diverse, their frequent lack of long-term temporal structure may however limit an LLM's ability to contextualize semantic and normative evolution of language and to capture diachronic variation. To support analysis and training for the latter, we introduce CHRONOBERG, a temporally structured corpus of English book texts spanning 250 years, curated from Project Gutenberg and enriched with a variety of temporal annotations. First, the edited nature of books enables us to quantify lexical semantic change through time-sensitive Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) analysis and to construct historically calibrated affective lexicons to support temporally grounded interpretation. With the lexicons at hand, we demonstrate a need for modern LLM-based tools to better situate their detection of discriminatory language and contextualization of sentiment across various time-periods. In fact, we show how language models trained sequentially on CHRONOBERG struggle to encode diachronic shifts in meaning, emphasizing the need for temporally aware training and evaluation pipelines, and positioning CHRONOBERG as a scalable resource for the study of linguistic change and temporal generalization. Disclaimer: This paper includes language and display of samples that could be offensive to readers.

| **[UrbanFeel: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Temporal and Perceptual Understanding of City Scenes through Human Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22228v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering, rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5 Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development. Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as beautiful and safety.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Boosting LLM Serving through Spatial-Temporal GPU Resource Sharing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19516v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern LLM serving systems confront inefficient GPU utilization due to the fundamental mismatch between compute-intensive prefill and memory-bound decode phases. While current practices attempt to address this by organizing these phases into hybrid batches, such solutions create an inefficient tradeoff that sacrifices either throughput or latency, leaving substantial GPU resources underutilized. We identify two key root causes: 1) the prefill phase suffers from suboptimal compute utilization due to wave quantization and attention bottlenecks. 2) hybrid batches disproportionately prioritize latency over throughput, resulting in wasted compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate the issues, we present Bullet, a novel spatial-temporal orchestration system that eliminates these inefficiencies through precise phase coordination. Bullet enables concurrent execution of prefill and decode phases, while dynamically provisioning GPU resources using real-time performance modeling. By integrating SLO-aware scheduling and adaptive resource allocation, Bullet maximizes utilization without compromising latency targets. Experimental evaluations on real-world workloads demonstrate that Bullet delivers 1.26x average throughput gains (up to 1.55x) over state-of-the-arts, while consistently meeting latency constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeMosaic: Temporal Heterogeneity Guided Time Series Forecasting via Adaptive Granularity Patch and Segment-wise Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19406v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance, transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing datasets mainly depict static AIGT detection. In this work, we introduce RedNote-Vibe, the first longitudinal (5-years) dataset for social media AIGT analysis. This dataset is sourced from Xiaohongshu platform, containing user engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments) and timestamps spanning from the pre-LLM period to July 2025, which enables research into the temporal dynamics and user interaction patterns of AIGT. Furthermore, to detect AIGT in the context of social media, we propose PsychoLinguistic AIGT Detection Framework (PLAD), an interpretable approach that leverages psycholinguistic features. Our experiments show that PLAD achieves superior detection performance and provides insights into the signatures distinguishing human and AI-generated content. More importantly, it reveals the complex relationship between these linguistic features and social media engagement. The dataset is available at https://github.com/testuser03158/RedNote-Vibe.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAPTRv3: Spatial and Temporal Context Foster Robust Tracking of Any Point in Long Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18671v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, built upon TAPTRv2, we present TAPTRv3. TAPTRv2 is a simple yet effective DETR-like point tracking framework that works fine in regular videos but tends to fail in long videos. TAPTRv3 improves TAPTRv2 by addressing its shortcomings in querying high-quality features from long videos, where the target tracking points normally undergo increasing variation over time. In TAPTRv3, we propose to utilize both spatial and temporal context to bring better feature querying along the spatial and temporal dimensions for more robust tracking in long videos. For better spatial feature querying, we identify that off-the-shelf attention mechanisms struggle with point-level tasks and present Context-aware Cross-Attention (CCA). CCA introduces spatial context into the attention mechanism to enhance the quality of attention scores when querying image features. For better temporal feature querying, we introduce Visibility-aware Long-Temporal Attention (VLTA), which conducts temporal attention over past frames while considering their corresponding visibilities. This effectively addresses the feature drifting problem in TAPTRv2 caused by its RNN-like long-term modeling. TAPTRv3 surpasses TAPTRv2 by a large margin on most of the challenging datasets and obtains state-of-the-art performance. Even when compared with methods trained on large-scale extra internal data, TAPTRv3 still demonstrates superiority.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a framework for generating moving sounds given text prompts in a controllable fashion. To enable training, we construct a synthetic dataset that records moving sounds in binaural format, their spatial trajectories, and text captions about the sound event and spatial motion. Using this dataset, we train a text-to-trajectory prediction model that outputs the three-dimensional trajectory of a moving sound source given text prompts. To generate spatial audio, we first fine-tune a pre-trained text-to-audio generative model to output temporally aligned mono sound with the trajectory. The spatial audio is then simulated using the predicted temporally-aligned trajectory. Experimental evaluation demonstrates reasonable spatial understanding of the text-to-trajectory model. This approach could be easily integrated into existing text-to-audio generative workflow and extended to moving sound generation in other spatial audio formats.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOSS-ChatV: Reinforcement Learning with Process Reasoning Reward for Video Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21113v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct, undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation. MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2, confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.</p></details> |  |
| **[STQE: Spatial-Temporal Attribute Quality Enhancement for G-PCC Compressed Dynamic Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17522v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic point clouds. In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE) network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames, a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5% for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal-Aware Iterative Speech Model for Dementia Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00030v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning systems often struggle with processing long sequences, where computational complexity can become a bottleneck. Current methods for automated dementia detection using speech frequently rely on static, time-agnostic features or aggregated linguistic content, lacking the flexibility to model the subtle, progressive deterioration inherent in speech production. These approaches often miss the dynamic temporal patterns that are critical early indicators of cognitive decline. In this paper, we introduce TAI-Speech, a Temporal Aware Iterative framework that dynamically models spontaneous speech for dementia detection. The flexibility of our method is demonstrated through two key innovations: 1) Optical Flow-inspired Iterative Refinement: By treating spectrograms as sequential frames, this component uses a convolutional GRU to capture the fine-grained, frame-to-frame evolution of acoustic features. 2) Cross-Attention Based Prosodic Alignment: This component dynamically aligns spectral features with prosodic patterns, such as pitch and pauses, to create a richer representation of speech production deficits linked to functional decline (IADL). TAI-Speech adaptively models the temporal evolution of each utterance, enhancing the detection of cognitive markers. Experimental results on the DementiaBank dataset show that TAI-Speech achieves a strong AUC of 0.839 and 80.6\% accuracy, outperforming text-based baselines without relying on ASR. Our work provides a more flexible and robust solution for automated cognitive assessment, operating directly on the dynamics of raw audio.</p></details> |  |

While earlier approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in this critical domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncovering Alzheimer's Disease Progression via SDE-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Deep Learning on Longitudinal Brain Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21735v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs 0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories. These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and reliability constraints.</p></details> |  |

We reveal that existing reinforcement learning methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), rely on on-policy sampling for policy updates. However, in tasks with large temporal search spaces, this strategy becomes both inefficient and limited in performance, as it often fails to identify temporally accurate solutions. To address this limitation, TempSamp-R1 leverages ground-truth annotations as off-policy supervision to provide temporally precise guidance, effectively compensating for the sparsity and misalignment in on-policy solutions. To further stabilize training and reduce variance in reward-based updates, TempSamp-R1 provides a non-linear soft advantage computation method that dynamically reshapes the reward feedback via an asymmetric transformation. By employing a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training paradigm, TempSamp-R1 optimizes a single unified model to support both CoT and non-CoT inference modes, enabling efficient handling of queries with varying reasoning complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TempSamp-R1 outperforms GRPO-based baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets: Charades-STA (R1@0.7: 52.9%, +2.7%), ActivityNet Captions (R1@0.5: 56.0%, +5.3%), and QVHighlights (mAP: 30.0%, +3.0%).

In Ireland's highly variable maritime climate, where ground-based measurement stations are sparsely distributed, selecting an appropriate solar irradiance dataset presents a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling framework for predicting solar irradiance at hourly and sub-hourly (10-minute) resolutions across Ireland. Cross-validation demonstrates that our model is statistically robust across all temporal resolutions with hourly showing highest prediction precision whereas 10-minute resolution encounters higher errors but better uncertainty quantification. In separate evaluations, we compare our model against alternative data sources, including reanalysis datasets and nearest-station interpolation, and find that it consistently provides superior site-specific accuracy. At the hourly scale, our model outperforms ERA5 in agreement with ground-based observations. At the sub-hourly scale, 10-minute resolution estimates provide solar PV power outputs consistent with residential and industrial solar PV installations in Ireland. Beyond surpassing existing datasets, our model delivers full uncertainty quantification, scalability and the capacity for real-time implementation, offering a powerful tool for solar energy prediction and the estimation of losses due to overload clipping from inverter undersizing.</p></details> |  |

The physical layer maps the geographic movement of individuals, while the information layer tracks the spread of knowledge and health behavior via social interactions. We explore the interplay between physical mobility, information flow, and epidemic outcomes by simulating disease spread within this dual-structured network. Our model employs stochastic elements to mirror human behavior, mobility, and information dissemination uncertainties. Through simulations, we assess the impact of network structure, mobility patterns, and information spread speed on epidemic dynamics. The findings highlight the crucial role of effective communication in curbing disease transmission, even in highly mobile societies. Additionally, our agent-based simulation allows for real-time scenario analysis through a user interface, offering insights into leveraging physical and informational networks for epidemic control. This research sheds light on designing strategic interventions in complex social systems to manage disease outbreaks.</p></details> |  |

However, extending these models from static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos, which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes, or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

In this paper, we propose an optimal smooth coverage trajectory planning algorithm. The algorithm consists of two stages. In the front-end, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for Points of Interest (POIs), generating an initial sequence of optimized visiting points. In the back-end, the sequence is further optimized by considering trajectory smoothness, time consumption, and obstacle avoidance. This is formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem and solved to produce a smooth coverage trajectory that satisfies these constraints. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, ensuring UAVs can smoothly cover all POIs in cluttered environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the 44th Chinese Control Conference, 2025.

In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb Graphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that preserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and compute-efficient.

| **[Mask2IV: Interaction-Centric Video Generation via Mask Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03135v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality, obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process. Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://reagan1311.github.io/mask2iv</p></details> |

However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication, the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$ on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in safeguarding sensitive data.</p></details> |  |

The importance of accurate real-time performance of the controller lies in safety considerations of situations where the dynamic system under control is affected by uncertainties and disturbances, and the controller should compensate for such phenomena in order to provide stable performance. A multiple-shooting nonlinear model-predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. This framework benefits from suitable algorithm along with readings from various sensors for genuine real-time performance with extremely high accuracy. The controller is then tested for tracking different trajectories where it demonstrates highly desirable performance in terms of both speed and accuracy. This controller shows remarkable improvement when compared to existing nonlinear model-predictive controllers in the literature that were implemented on skid-steered mobile platforms.</p></details> |  |

We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically, ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints, ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence.

However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity. The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation. Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning ($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of REACT-Drive.</p></details> | 13 pages,5 figures |
| **[Distributed Koopman Learning using Partial Trajectories for Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07212v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a distributed data-driven framework for dynamics learning, termed distributed deep Koopman learning using partial trajectories (DDKL-PT). In this framework, each agent in a multi-agent system is assigned a partial trajectory offline and locally approximates the unknown dynamics using a deep neural network within the Koopman operator framework. By exchanging local estimated dynamics rather than training data, agents achieve consensus on a global dynamics model without sharing their private training trajectories. Simulation studies on a surface vehicle demonstrate that DDKL-PT attains consensus with respect to the learned dynamics, with each agent achieving reasonably small approximation errors over the testing data. Furthermore, a model predictive control scheme is developed by integrating the learned Koopman dynamics with known kinematic relations. Results on goal-tracking and station-keeping tasks support that the distributedly learned dynamics are sufficiently accurate for model-based optimal control.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Trajectory Generator for High-Density Traffic and Diverse Agent-Interaction Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02627v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is fundamental to autonomous driving, as it underpins safe motion planning and collision avoidance in complex environments. However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous road environments into a structured grid representation that supports fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety. Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Best Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18873v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful approach for aligning generative models, but its reliance on learned reward models makes it vulnerable to mis-specification and reward hacking. Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) offers a more robust alternative by directly leveraging noisy binary comparisons over trajectories. We study the best policy identification problem in PbRL, motivated by post-training optimization of generative models, for example, during multi-turn interactions. Learning in this setting combines an offline preference dataset--potentially biased or out-of-distribution and collected from a rater of subpar 'competence'--with online pure exploration, making systematic online learning essential. To this end, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling that maintains posteriors over the reward model and dynamics. We provide the first Bayesian simple regret guarantees for PbRL and introduce an efficient approximation that outperforms existing baselines on simulation and image generation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCoT: Unifying Consistency Models and Rectified Flows via Straight-Consistent Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16972v4)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained diffusion models are commonly used to generate clean data (e.g., images) from random noises, effectively forming pairs of noises and corresponding clean images. Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions, whether traditional position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms, and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools. Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user preferences.</p></details> |  |

A promising direction is to leverage the generalist knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large-language models by treating unusual driving scenarios as a logical reasoning task. In this work, we present Poutine, a method that uses an off-the-shelf 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) - without any additional components - to achieve robust end-to-end autonomous driving via a simple and scalable training recipe. To learn strong base driving capabilities, we first train Poutine-Base using self-supervised next-token prediction over vision, language, and trajectory (VLT) tokens, leveraging both nominal and long-tail driving data. In the second stage, we fine-tune Poutine-Base using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a small set of human preference-labeled examples. We evaluated our approach on the Waymo end-to-end driving benchmark curated for long-tail scenarios. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. Our results suggest that handcrafted tokenizers or custom architectural components added to base VLMs in prior work are not necessary to achieve strong driving performance. Instead, this work highlights the potential of scalable VLT pretraining combined with lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Selection for Fine-tuning Vision Language Models via Cross Modal Alignment Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01454v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to the best baseline for LLaVA-665k.

Advances in robot performance have increased the hopping height to greater than 4 meters and opened up the possibility for more complex aerial trajectories (i.e., behaviors). However, currently hopping robots do not directly control their aerial trajectory or transition to flight, eliminating the efficiency benefits of a hopping system. Here we show a real-time, computationally efficiency, non-linear drag compensated, trajectory generation methodology and accompanying Lyapunov-based controller. The combined system can create and follow complex aerial trajectories from liftoff to touchdown on horizontal and vertical surfaces, while maintaining strick control over the orientation at touchdown. The computational efficiency provides broad applicability across all size scales of hopping robots while maintaining applicability to quadrotors in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer flexibility to define precise motion but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) handles high-dimensional spaces with strong robustness but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. Opt2Skill generates dynamic feasible and contact-consistent reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and trains RL policies to track these optimal trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms baselines that rely on human demonstrations and inverse kinematics-based references, both in motion tracking and task success rates. Furthermore, we show that incorporating trajectories with torque information improves contact force tracking in contact-involved tasks, such as wiping a table. We have successfully transferred our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

This work proposes an optimization-based methodology, termed Trajectory Based Optimization Design (TBOD), allowing the user to easily design observers for general nonlinear systems and multi-sensor setups. Starting from parametrized observer dynamics, the proposed method considers a finite set of pre-recorded measurement trajectories from the nominal plant and exploits them to tune the observer parameters through numerical optimization. This research hinges on the classic observer's theory and Moving Horizon Estimators methodology. Optimization is exploited to ease the observer's design, providing the user with a lightweight, general-purpose sensor fusion methodology. TBOD's main characteristics are the capability to handle general sensors efficiently and in a modular way and, most importantly, its straightforward tuning procedure. The TBOD's performance is tested on a terrestrial rover localization problem, combining IMU and ranging sensors provided by Ultra Wide Band antennas, and validated through a motion-capture system. Comparison with an Extended Kalman Filter is also provided, matching its position estimation accuracy and significantly improving in the orientation.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion models have recently demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment. This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS.

Operational Competence Assessment for AI-Based Trajectory Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00619v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated driving functions increasingly rely on machine learning for tasks like perception and trajectory planning, requiring large, relevant datasets. The performance of these algorithms depends on how closely the training data matches the task. To ensure reliable functioning, it is crucial to know what is included in the dataset to assess the trained model's operational risk. We aim to enhance the safe use of machine learning in automated driving by developing a method to recognize situations that an automated vehicle has not been sufficiently trained on. This method also improves explainability by describing the dataset at a human-understandable level. We propose modeling driving data as knowledge graphs, representing driving scenes with entities and their relationships. These graphs are queried for specific sub-scene configurations to check their occurrence in the dataset. We estimate a vehicle's competence in a driving scene by considering the coverage and complexity of sub-scene configurations in the training set. Higher complexity scenes require greater coverage for high competence. We apply this method to the NuPlan dataset, modeling it with knowledge graphs and analyzing the coverage of specific driving scenes. This approach helps monitor the competence of machine learning models trained on the dataset, which is essential for trustworthy AI to be deployed in automated driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in proceedings of the 2025 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference</p></details> |

While human videos offer a scalable alternative, effectively transferring manipulation knowledge is fundamentally hindered by the significant morphological gap between human and robotic embodiments. To address this challenge and facilitate skill transfer from human to robot, we introduce Traj2Action,a novel framework that bridges this embodiment gap by using the 3D trajectory of the operational endpoint as a unified intermediate representation, and then transfers the manipulation knowledge embedded in this trajectory to the robot's actions. Our policy first learns to generate a coarse trajectory, which forms an high-level motion plan by leveraging both human and robot data. This plan then conditions the synthesis of precise, robot-specific actions (e.g., orientation and gripper state) within a co-denoising framework. Extensive real-world experiments on a Franka robot demonstrate that Traj2Action boosts the performance by up to 27% and 22.25% over $\pi_0$ baseline on short- and long-horizon real-world tasks, and achieves significant gains as human data scales in robot policy learning.

| **[Dynamic-TreeRPO: Breaking the Independent Trajectory Bottleneck with Structured Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23352v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM) rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.</p></details> | Fig.3 updated |
| **[On the joint observability of flow fields and particle properties from Lagrangian trajectories: evidence from neural data assimilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00479v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We numerically investigate the joint observability of flow states and unknown particle properties from Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) data. LPT offers time-resolved, volumetric measurements of particle trajectories, but experimental tracks are spatially sparse, potentially noisy, and may be further complicated by inertial transport, raising the question of whether both Eulerian fields and particle characteristics can be reliably inferred. To address this, we develop a data assimilation framework that couples an Eulerian flow representation with Lagrangian particle models, enabling the simultaneous inference of carrier fields and particle properties under the governing equations of disperse multiphase flow. Using this approach, we establish empirical existence proofs of joint observability across three representative regimes. In a turbulent boundary layer with noisy tracer tracks (St to 0), flow states and true particle positions are jointly observable. In homogeneous isotropic turbulence seeded with inertial particles (St ~ 1-5), we demonstrate simultaneous recovery of flow states and particle diameters, showing the feasibility of implicit particle characterization. In a compressible, shock-dominated flow, we report the first joint reconstructions of velocity, pressure, density, and inertial particle properties (diameter and density), highlighting both the potential and certain limits of observability in supersonic regimes. Systematic sensitivity studies further reveal how seeding density, noise level, and Stokes number govern reconstruction accuracy, yielding practical guidelines for experimental design. Taken together, these results show that the scope of LPT could be broadened to multiphase and high-speed flows, in which tracer and measurement fidelity are limited.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Self-Evolving Benchmarks: Synthesizing Agent Trajectories via Test-Time Exploration under Validate-by-Reproduce Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00415v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE) framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2) problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic, self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging runway for agent development.</p></details> | <details><summary>his i...</summary><p>his is a work in progress due to methodology refinement and further evaluation</p></details> |
| **[EgoTraj-Bench: Towards Robust Trajectory Prediction Under Ego-view Noisy Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00405v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy, first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories, enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of real-world, ego-centric perception.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally Smooth Mesh Extraction for Procedural Scenes with Long-Range Camera Trajectories using Spacetime Octrees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13306v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The procedural occupancy function is a flexible and compact representation for creating 3D scenes. For rasterization and other tasks, it is often necessary to extract a mesh that represents the shape. Unbounded scenes with long-range camera trajectories, such as flying through a forest, pose a unique challenge for mesh extraction. A single static mesh representing all the geometric detail necessary for the full camera path can be prohibitively large. Therefore, independent meshes can be extracted for different camera views, but this approach may lead to popping artifacts during transitions. We propose a temporally coherent method for extracting meshes suitable for long-range camera trajectories in unbounded scenes represented by an occupancy function. The key idea is to perform 4D mesh extraction using a new spacetime tree structure called a binary-octree. Experiments show that, compared to existing baseline methods, our method offers superior visual consistency at a comparable cost.

Traditionally, nonconvex optimization problems are solved by forming and solving a sequence of convex optimization problems, where the cost and constraint functions are approximated locally through Taylor series expansions. This presents a challenge for functions where differentiation is expensive or unavailable. In this work, we present a derivative-free approach to form these convex approximations by computing samples of the dynamics, cost, and constraint functions and letting the solver interpolate between them. Our framework includes sample-based trajectory optimization techniques like model-predictive path integral (MPPI) control as a special case and generalizes them to enable features like multiple shooting and general equality and inequality constraints that are traditionally associated with derivative-based sequential convex programming methods. The resulting framework is simple, flexible, and capable of solving a wide variety of practical motion planning and control problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analytic Conditions for Differentiable Collision Detection in Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26459v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization-based methods are widely used for computing fast, diverse solutions for complex tasks such as collision-free movement or planning in the presence of contacts. However, most of these methods require enforcing non-penetration constraints between objects, resulting in a non-trivial and computationally expensive problem. This makes the use of optimization-based methods for planning and control challenging. In this paper, we present a method to efficiently enforce non-penetration of sets while performing optimization over their configuration, which is directly applicable to problems like collision-aware trajectory optimization. We introduce novel differentiable conditions with analytic expressions to achieve this. To enforce non-collision between non-smooth bodies using these conditions, we introduce a method to approximate polytopes as smooth semi-algebraic sets. We present several numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and compare the performance with other baseline methods recently proposed in the literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures.

The majority of existing placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preemptive Spatiotemporal Trajectory Adjustment for Heterogeneous Vehicles in Highway Merging Zones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25929v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aiming at the problem of driver's perception lag and low utilization efficiency of space-time resources in expressway ramp confluence area, based on the preemptive spatiotemporal trajectory Adjustment system, from the perspective of coordinating spatiotemporal resources, the reasonable value of safe space-time distance in trajectory pre-preparation is quantitatively analyzed. The minimum safety gap required for ramp vehicles to merge into the mainline is analyzed by introducing double positioning error and spatiotemporal trajectory tracking error. A merging control strategy for autonomous driving heterogeneous vehicles is proposed, which integrates vehicle type, driving intention, and safety spatiotemporal distance. The specific confluence strategies of ramp target vehicles and mainline cooperative vehicles under different vehicle types are systematically expounded. A variety of traffic flow and speed scenarios are used for full combination simulation. By comparing the time-position-speed diagram, the vehicle operation characteristics and the dynamic difference of confluence are qualitatively analyzed, and the average speed and average delay are used as the evaluation indices to quantitatively evaluate the performance advantages of the preemptive cooperative confluence control strategy. The results show that the maximum average delay improvement rates of mainline and ramp vehicles are 90.24 % and 74.24 %, respectively. The proposed strategy can effectively avoid potential vehicle conflicts and emergency braking behaviors, improve driving safety in the confluence area, and show significant advantages in driving stability and overall traffic efficiency optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vector sketch animation generation with differentialable motion trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25857v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sketching is a direct and inexpensive means of visual expression. Though image-based sketching has been well studied, video-based sketch animation generation is still very challenging due to the temporal coherence requirement. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end automatic generation approach for vector sketch animation. To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the frame-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable polynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation across multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and temporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a Bernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus achieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency and supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods. Cross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the robustness and compatibility of our approach.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Training-Free Reward-Guided Image Editing via Trajectory Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25845v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward hacking.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[SSTP: Efficient Sample Selection for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17385v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a core task in autonomous driving. However, training advanced trajectory prediction models on existing large-scale datasets is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. More critically, these datasets are highly imbalanced in scenario density, with normal driving scenes (low-moderate traffic) overwhelmingly dominating the datasets, while high-density and safety-critical cases are underrepresented. As a result, models tend to overfit low/moderate-density scenarios and perform poorly in high-density scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the SSTP framework, which constructs a compact yet density-balanced dataset tailored to trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages: (1)Extraction, where a baseline model is pretrained for a few epochs to obtain stable gradient estimates, and the dataset is partitioned by scenario density. (2)Selection, where gradient-based scores and a submodular objective select representative samples within each density category, while biased sampling emphasizes rare high-density interactions to avoid dominance by low-density cases. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Experiments on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets with recent state-of-the-art models show that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Robust trajectory prediction depends not only on data scale but also on balancing scene density to ensure reliable performance under complex multi agent interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Encryption Cooperative Salvo Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17341v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the concept of trajectory encryption in cooperative simultaneous target interception, wherein heterogeneity in guidance principles across a team of unmanned autonomous systems is leveraged as a strategic design feature. By employing a mix of heterogeneous time-to-go formulations leading to a cooperative guidance strategy, the swarm of vehicles is able to generate diverse trajectory families. This diversity expands the feasible solution space for simultaneous target interception, enhances robustness under disturbances, and enables flexible time-to-go adjustments without predictable detouring. From an adversarial perspective, heterogeneity obscures the collective interception intent by preventing straightforward prediction of swarm dynamics, effectively acting as an encryption layer in the trajectory domain. Simulations demonstrate that the swarm of heterogeneous vehicles is able to intercept a moving target simultaneously from a diverse set of initial engagement configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[LATTE: Latent Trajectory Embedding for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03054v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This erodes trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generated image detectors that remain reliable across different generators. While recent approaches leverage diffusion denoising cues, they typically rely on single-step reconstruction errors and overlook the sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose LATTE - LATent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the evolution of latent embeddings across multiple denoising steps. Instead of treating each denoising step in isolation, LATTE captures the trajectory of these representations, revealing subtle and discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated images. Experiments on several benchmarks, such as GenImage, Chameleon, and Diffusion Forensics, show that LATTE achieves superior performance, especially in challenging cross-generator and cross-dataset scenarios, highlighting the potential of latent trajectory modeling. The code is available on the following link: https://github.com/AnaMVasilcoiu/LATTE-Diffusion-Detector.</p></details> |  |
| **[TR2-D2: Tree Search Guided Trajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25171v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control offers a promising framework for diffusion fine-tuning, where a pre-trained diffusion model is optimized to generate paths that lead to a reward-tilted distribution. While these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion (TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single- and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models, highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Hyperparameter Tuning via Trajectory Invariance Principle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25049v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As hyperparameter tuning becomes increasingly costly at scale, efficient tuning methods are essential. Yet principles for guiding hyperparameter tuning remain limited. In this work, we seek to establish such principles by considering a broad range of hyperparameters, including batch size, learning rate, and weight decay. We identify a phenomenon we call trajectory invariance, where pre-training loss curves, gradient noise, and gradient norm exhibit invariance--closely overlapping--with respect to a quantity that combines learning rate and weight decay. This phenomenon effectively reduces the original two-dimensional hyperparameter space to one dimension, yielding an efficient tuning rule: follow the salient direction revealed by trajectory invariance. Furthermore, we refine previous scaling laws and challenge several existing viewpoints. Overall, our work proposes new principles for efficient tuning and inspires future research on scaling laws.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on the comprehensive OpenAlex dataset and employing fractional counting to avoid double attribution in co-authored work, the research maps the relative shares of AI publications across major global players. The analysis reveals a profound restructuring of the international AI research landscape. The US and the European Union (EU27), once the undisputed and established leaders, have experienced a notable decline in relative dominance, with their combined share of publications falling from over 57% in 2000 to less than 25% in 2025. In contrast, China has undergone a dramatic ascent, expanding its global share of AI publications from under 5% in 2000 to nearly 36% by 2025, thereby emerging as the single most dominant contributor. Alongside China, India has also risen substantially, consolidating a multipolar Asian research ecosystem. These empirical findings highlight the strategic implications of concentrated research output, particularly China's capacity to shape the future direction of AI innovation and standard-setting. While the study calculates the volume of AI publications (in percentage as global share) as a measure of research dominance, it also acknowledges limitations in capturing quality and impact, suggesting scholarly research areas for future work on high-impact AI scholarship.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably stitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties are needed to compose: \emph{positional equivariance} and \emph{local receptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion planning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling. Experimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than positional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition, both are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple architecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive methods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based guidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable generalization in goal-conditioned settings.</p></details> | 9 Pages |
| **[Trajectory Prediction via Bayesian Intention Inference under Unknown Goals and Kinematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24928v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces an adaptive Bayesian algorithm for real-time trajectory prediction via intention inference, where a target's intentions and motion characteristics are unknown and subject to change. The method concurrently estimates two critical variables: the target's current intention, modeled as a Markovian latent state, and an intention parameter that describes the target's adherence to a shortest-path policy. By integrating this joint update technique, the algorithm maintains robustness against abrupt intention shifts and unknown motion dynamics. A sampling-based trajectory prediction mechanism then exploits these adaptive estimates to generate probabilistic forecasts with quantified uncertainty. We validate the framework through numerical experiments: Ablation studies of two cases, and a 500-trial Monte Carlo analysis; Hardware demonstrations on quadrotor and quadrupedal platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms non-adaptive and partially adaptive methods. The method operates in real time around 270 Hz without requiring training or detailed prior knowledge of target behavior, showcasing its applicability in various robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

While these approaches make more realistic motions possible, they are limited by the amount of available motion data, and do not incorporate prior knowledge about the physical laws governing the system and its interactions with the environment. Thus they may violate such laws, leading to divergent trajectories and sliding contacts which limit real-world stability. We address such limitations via a two-pronged learning strategy which leverages the known physics of the system and fundamental control principles. First, we encode physics priors during supervised imitation learning to promote trajectory feasibility. Second, we minimize drift at inference time by applying a proportional-integral controller directly to the generated output state. We validate our method on various locomotion behaviors for the ergoCub humanoid robot, where a physics-informed loss encourages zero contact foot velocity. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is compatible with multiple controllers on a real robot and significantly improves the accuracy and physical constraint conformity of generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Hangzhou, China, 2025</p></details> |

Finally, we tailor a flexible model architecture to accommodate a variety of trajectory tasks, effectively capturing complex movement patterns to support broad applicability. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior scalability, adaptability, and generalization, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal yet non-exclusive training resource.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a research paper by NeurIPS'25</p></details> |

Trajectory control represents a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However, existing methods either require substantial training resources or are specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding, STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control. Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory controllability.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we provide a multilinguistic, large-scale assessment of this similarity by systematically comparing 16 publicly available pretrained LLMs with human brain responses during natural language processing tasks in both English and Chinese. Specifically, we use ridge regression to assess the representational similarity between LLM embeddings and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and analyze the similarity between the "neural trajectory" and the "LLM latent trajectory." This method captures key dynamic patterns, such as magnitude, angle, uncertainty, and confidence. Our findings highlight both similarities and crucial differences in processing strategies: (1) We show that middle-to-high layers of LLMs are central to semantic integration and correspond to the N400 component observed in EEG; (2) The brain exhibits continuous and iterative processing during reading, whereas LLMs often show discrete, stage-end bursts of activity, which suggests a stark contrast in their real-time semantic processing dynamics. This study could offer new insights into LLMs and neural processing, and also establish a critical framework for future investigations into the alignment between artificial intelligence and biological intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Dataset distillation offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets. Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states, overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity. Experiments on medical image classification tasks demonstrate that our method improves distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model accuracy comparable to training on the original datasets.

| **[Evaluation of Machine and Deep Learning Techniques for Cyclone Trajectory Regression and Status Classification by Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24146v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate cyclone forecasting is essential for minimizing loss of life, infrastructure damage, and economic disruption. Traditional numerical weather prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision, recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about 2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models, especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone prediction and integration into decision support systems.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further reference.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |
| **[BrainPath: Generating Subject-Specific Brain Aging Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16667v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying and forecasting individual brain aging trajectories is critical for understanding neurodegenerative disease and the heterogeneity of aging, yet current approaches remain limited. Most models predict chronological age, an imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here, we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns. Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hazy Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction via Physical Priors and Graph-Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24020v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a 78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range dependency modeling. Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE / minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Masked Diffusion Language Models via Consistency Trajectory Reinforcement Learning with Fewer Decoding Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23924v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) language models, offering properties such as parallel decoding, flexible generation orders, and the potential for fewer inference steps. Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored. A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal (parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding, achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO) for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks, such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct. The results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/yjyddq/EOSER-ASS-RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables.

However, guiding these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans, appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improving the Efficiency of LLM Agent Systems through Trajectory Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23586v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-turn agent systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly popular for software engineering tasks. While LLM agents show decent effectiveness, the high computational cost of input tokens due to the ever-growing trajectory remains an efficiency concern for their applications. Efficiency is largely neglected in existing studies and agent products, and this paper fills the gap by introducing an inference-time trajectory reduction approach to reduce the cost of agents. Through analyzing existing agent trajectories, we demonstrate that useless, redundant, and expired information is widespread in all trajectories, which can be identified and reduced without harming the agent's performance. We then design a simple yet effective trajectory reduction approach, AgentDiet, which automatically removes such waste information. We implement AgentDiet on a top-performing coding agent, and the evaluation on two LLMs and two benchmarks shows that AgentDiet can reduce input tokens by 39.9% ~ 59.7%, or the final computational cost by 21.1% ~ 35.9%, while maintaining the same agent performance. This indicates that trajectory reduction is a promising direction for agent systems.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |
| **[TGRPO :Fine-tuning Vision-Language-Action Model via Trajectory-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08440v3)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong cross-scenario generalization capabilities in various robotic tasks through large-scale pre-training and task-specific fine-tuning. However, their training paradigm mainly relies on manually collected successful demonstrations, making it difficult to adapt to complex environments when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or execution biases. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a closed-loop optimization framework via active trial-and-error mechanism, it suffers from sparse rewards, high variance, and unstable optimization in long-horizon robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Trajectory-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO), an online RL-based training framework for VLA models. TGRPO leverages task analysis generated by a large language model to automatically construct dense reward functions, providing fine-grained feedback to accelerate convergence and improve credit assignment. The core of our method is a group-based strategy that samples and normalizes multiple trajectories in parallel, reducing variance through relative comparison. By integrating trajectory-level and step-level advantage estimation, TGRPO captures both global and local optimization signals without relying on a value network. Experiments on four task categories of the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TGRPO achieves an average success rate of 80.7\%, which is 4.2\% higher than that of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and outperforms other representative RL-based post-training methods.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on raw visual data such as camera images, our method utilizes highly compressed and informative BEV representations, which are generated by fusing multi-modal sensor data (e.g., camera and LiDAR) and aligning them with HD Maps. This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate 44.8% improvements in planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance. Our work highlights that VLMs can effectively interpret processed visual representations like BEV features, expanding their applicability beyond raw images in trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion Trajectory Alignment via Stepwise Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04832v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we propose an offline preference optimization method to approach trajectory alignment for discrete diffusion models. Instead of applying the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise alignment objectives by matching the per-step posterior. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization, is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, yields an equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design, protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 81.2 on LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |
| **[From Evidence to Trajectory: Abductive Reasoning Path Synthesis for Training Retrieval-Augmented Generation Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23071v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation agents development is hindered by the lack of process-level supervision to effectively guide agentic capabilities like task decomposition, retriever invocation, and stepwise decision-making. While reinforcement learning offers a potential solution, it suffers from sparse rewards and the limited reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Meanwhile, existing data synthesis methods only produce chain-of-thought rationales and fail to model environmental interactions. In this paper, we propose EviPath, an evidence-anchored reasoning path synthesis paradigm for RAG agent development. EviPath comprises: (i) Abductive Subtask Planning, which decomposes the problem into sub-questions and iteratively plans an optimal solution path based on the dependencies between them; (ii) Faithful Sub-question Answering, which uses supporting evidence to construct a proxy environment to generate reasoning thoughts and answers for each sub-question; and (iii) Conversational Fine-Tuning, which formats the complete agent-environment interaction trajectory into a dialogue format suitable for Supervised Fine-Tuning. EviPath allows LLMs to learn complex reasoning and tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data. Extensive experiments on widely-used question-answering benchmarks show that an 8B parameter model trained with EviPath-synthesized data significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a double-digit absolute EM gain of 14.7% in open-domain question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physically Plausible Multi-System Trajectory Generation and Symmetry Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23003v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[JointDiff: Bridging Continuous and Discrete in Multi-Agent Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22522v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios: weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance, which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative models for interactive systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Proxy: Trajectory-Distilled Guidance for Offline GFlowNet Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20110v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are effective at sampling diverse, high-reward objects, but in many real-world settings where new reward queries are infeasible, they must be trained from offline datasets. The prevailing proxy-based training methods are susceptible to error propagation, while existing proxy-free approaches often use coarse constraints that limit exploration. To address these issues, we propose Trajectory-Distilled GFlowNet (TD-GFN), a novel proxy-free training framework. TD-GFN learns dense, transition-level edge rewards from offline trajectories via inverse reinforcement learning to provide rich structural guidance for efficient exploration. Crucially, to ensure robustness, these rewards are used indirectly to guide the policy through DAG pruning and prioritized backward sampling of training trajectories. This ensures that final gradient updates depend only on ground-truth terminal rewards from the dataset, thereby preventing the error propagation. Experiments show that TD-GFN significantly outperforms a broad range of existing baselines in both convergence speed and final sample quality, establishing a more robust and efficient paradigm for offline GFlowNet training.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnchDrive: Bootstrapping Diffusion Policies with Hybrid Trajectory Anchors for End-to-End Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20253v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end multi-modal planning has become a transformative paradigm in autonomous driving, effectively addressing behavioral multi-modality and the generalization challenge in long-tail scenarios. We propose AnchDrive, a framework for end-to-end driving that effectively bootstraps a diffusion policy to mitigate the high computational cost of traditional generative models. Rather than denoising from pure noise, AnchDrive initializes its planner with a rich set of hybrid trajectory anchors. These anchors are derived from two complementary sources: a static vocabulary of general driving priors and a set of dynamic, context-aware trajectories. The dynamic trajectories are decoded in real-time by a Transformer that processes dense and sparse perceptual features. The diffusion model then learns to refine these anchors by predicting a distribution of trajectory offsets, enabling fine-grained refinement. This anchor-based bootstrapping design allows for efficient generation of diverse, high-quality trajectories. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark confirm that AnchDrive sets a new state-of-the-art and shows strong generalizability</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17307v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but incurs substantial inference cost due to long autoregressive trajectories. Existing acceleration strategies either shorten traces via early stopping or compression, or adopt speculative decoding with a smaller model. However, speculative decoding provides limited gains when model agreement is low and rigidly enforces token-level consistency, overlooking the observation that some smaller models, when correct, produce significantly more concise reasoning traces that could reduce inference length. We introduce R-Stitch, a training-free hybrid decoding framework that leverages token-level entropy as an uncertainty proxy to delegate computation between a small language model (SLM) and an LLM. Our analysis shows that high-entropy tokens are more likely to induce errors, motivating an entropy-guided routing strategy that lets the SLM efficiently handle low-entropy tokens while delegating uncertain ones to the LLM, thereby avoiding full rollbacks and preserving answer quality. We further extend this design with R-Stitch$^{+}$, which learns an adaptive routing policy to adjust the token budget dynamically beyond fixed thresholds. By jointly reducing per-token decoding complexity and the number of generated tokens, our method achieves substantial acceleration with negligible accuracy loss. Concretely, it attains peak speedups of 3.00$\times$ on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, 3.85$\times$ on 14B, and 4.10$\times$ on QWQ-32B while maintaining accuracy comparable to full LLM decoding. Moreover, it naturally enables adaptive efficiency--accuracy trade-offs that can be tailored to diverse computational budgets without retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

In FedAVG multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing robust defense strategies.</p></details> |  |

Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step, preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream segmentation tasks. We release the code at: https://github.com/Chhro123/fast-foreground-aware-anomaly-synthesis.</p></details> |  |

Common maneuvers dominate datasets, while dangerous or rare scenarios are sparse. This imbalance can bias models toward the frequent cases and degrade performance on critical scenarios. To tackle this problem, we compare balancing strategies for sampling training data and find reweighting by trajectory pattern an effective approach. We then present FlowDrive, a flow-matching trajectory planner that learns a conditional rectified flow to map noise directly to trajectory distributions with few flow-matching steps. We further introduce moderated, in-the-loop guidance that injects small perturbation between flow steps to systematically increase trajectory diversity while remaining scene-consistent. On nuPlan and the interaction-focused interPlan benchmarks, FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based planners and approaches methods with rule-based refinements. After adding moderated guidance and light post-processing (FlowDrive*), it achieves overall state-of-the-art performance across nearly all benchmark splits.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a framework for generating moving sounds given text prompts in a controllable fashion. To enable training, we construct a synthetic dataset that records moving sounds in binaural format, their spatial trajectories, and text captions about the sound event and spatial motion. Using this dataset, we train a text-to-trajectory prediction model that outputs the three-dimensional trajectory of a moving sound source given text prompts. To generate spatial audio, we first fine-tune a pre-trained text-to-audio generative model to output temporally aligned mono sound with the trajectory. The spatial audio is then simulated using the predicted temporally-aligned trajectory. Experimental evaluation demonstrates reasonable spatial understanding of the text-to-trajectory model. This approach could be easily integrated into existing text-to-audio generative workflow and extended to moving sound generation in other spatial audio formats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plan-R1: Safe and Feasible Trajectory Planning as Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17659v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe and feasible trajectory planning is critical for real-world autonomous driving systems. However, existing learning-based planners rely heavily on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting undesirable behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a two-stage trajectory planning framework that decouples principle alignment from behavior learning. In the first stage, a general trajectory predictor is pre-trained on expert data to capture diverse, human-like driving behaviors. In the second stage, the model is fine-tuned with rule-based rewards using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), explicitly aligning ego planning with principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. This two-stage paradigm retains human-like behaviors while enhancing safety awareness and discarding undesirable patterns from demonstrations. Furthermore, we identify a key limitation of directly applying GRPO to planning: group-wise normalization erases cross-group scale differences, causing rare, high-variance safety-violation groups to have similar advantages as abundant low-variance safe groups, thereby suppressing optimization for safety-critical objectives. To address this, we propose Variance-Decoupled GRPO (VD-GRPO), which replaces normalization with centering and fixed scaling to preserve absolute reward magnitudes, ensuring that safety-critical objectives remain dominant throughout training. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance, particularly in realistic reactive settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/XiaolongTang23/Plan-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aircraft Trajectory Dataset Augmentation in Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07585v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aircraft trajectory modeling plays a crucial role in air traffic management (ATM) and is important for various downstream tasks, including conflict detection and landing time prediction. Dataset augmentation by adding synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is sufficient and balanced. We propose a novel framework called ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework, a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned latent space. The converted dataset is projected to reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original dimension, and the samples are decoded with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Several experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new, high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the results of several baselines.</p></details> |  |

Anticipating Future Motion by Generating Point Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21592v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e., predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating pixels rather than directly modeling motion.</p></details> |  |

The framework extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in constrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation.

Existing approaches often attempt to learn these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.</p></details> | ICME2025 |

However, we find that the perpendicular component of the pushing force from negative samples in contrastive learning is a double-edged sword: it contains rich supplementary information from negative samples, yet its unconstrained nature causes optimization trajectory drift and training instability. To address this, we propose Support Vector Regularization (SVR), a method that introduces an auxiliary support vector to control this perpendicular component, aiming to harness its rich information while mitigating the associated trajectory drift. The efficacy of SVR is critically governed by its semantic radius, for which we explore two unsupervised modeling strategies: direct parameterization and an adaptive radius predictor module enhanced with constraints to improve its predicting accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses widely used baselines like InfoNCE and SigLIP loss across classification, monolingual retrieval, and multilingual retrieval on standard audio-text datasets. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results on optimizing trajectory drift validate the correctness and effectiveness of our SVR method.</p></details> |  |

However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging. One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention, which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted for IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation System</p></details> |

Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection) to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit ``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.</p></details> | <details><summary>20pag...</summary><p>20pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization (JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics. To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to $\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning, and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling. We also release our efficient ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B for resource-constrained applications and edge deployment.

However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.

Unlike prior approaches that rely on discretized ESDF grids with interpolation, our method directly optimizes smooth trajectories represented by fifth-order polynomials over a continuous neural ESDF, ensuring precise gradient information throughout the entire trajectory. The framework integrates a two-stage nonlinear optimization pipeline that balances efficiency, safety and smoothness. Experimental results demonstrate that C-3TO produces collision-aware and dynamically feasible trajectories. Moreover, its flexibility in defining local window sizes and optimization parameters enables straightforward adaptation to diverse user's needs without compromising performance. By combining continuous trajectory parameterization with a continuously updated neural ESDF, C-3TO establishes a robust and generalizable foundation for safe and efficient local replanning in aerial robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ICRA 2026</p></details> |

Existing corridor based planners which rely on decomposition of the free space into collision free subsets scale poorly with environmental complexity and require explicit allocations of time windows to trajectory segments. We introduce a new trajectory parameterization that represents trajectories in a nonconvex collision free corridor as being in a convex cartesian product of balls. This parameterization allows us to decouple problem size from geometric complexity of the solution and naturally avoids explicit time allocation by allowing trajectories to evolve continuously inside ellipsoidal corridors. Building on this representation, we formulate the Orthogonal Trust Region Problem (Orth-TRP), a specialized convex program with separable block constraints, and develop a solver that exploits this parallel structure and the unique structure of each parallel subproblem for efficient optimization. Experiments on a quadrotor trajectory planning benchmark show that our approach produces smoother trajectories and lower runtimes than state-of-the-art corridor based planners, especially in highly complicated environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmenting Multi-Agent Communication with State Delta Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19209v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing multi-agent systems constructed from a single base LLM mostly use natural language for agent communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability, it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample its continuous state vectors to discrete tokens before transferring them to the other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process. We propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols, particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |

We identify a new vulnerability, LLMs generating convincing career trajectories in fake resumes and explore effective detection methods. To address this challenge, we construct a dataset of machine-generated career trajectories using LLMs and various methods, and demonstrate that conventional text-based detectors perform poorly on structured career data. We propose CareerScape, a novel heterogeneous, hierarchical multi-layer graph framework that models career entities and their relations in a unified global graph built from genuine resumes. Unlike conventional classifiers that treat each instance independently, CareerScape employs a structure-aware framework that augments user-specific subgraphs with trusted neighborhood information from a global graph, enabling the model to capture both global structural patterns and local inconsistencies indicative of synthetic career paths. Experimental results show that CareerScape outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5.8-85.0% relatively, highlighting the importance of structure-aware detection for machine-generated content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Main</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose an optimal smooth coverage trajectory planning algorithm. The algorithm consists of two stages. In the front-end, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for Points of Interest (POIs), generating an initial sequence of optimized visiting points. In the back-end, the sequence is further optimized by considering trajectory smoothness, time consumption, and obstacle avoidance. This is formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem and solved to produce a smooth coverage trajectory that satisfies these constraints. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, ensuring UAVs can smoothly cover all POIs in cluttered environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the 44th Chinese Control Conference, 2025.

By combining individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse urban environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 2 algorithms, 1 table</p></details> |

However, existing methods often struggle to model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality, obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process. Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://reagan1311.github.io/mask2iv</p></details> |

However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication, the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$ on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in safeguarding sensitive data.</p></details> |  |

The importance of accurate real-time performance of the controller lies in safety considerations of situations where the dynamic system under control is affected by uncertainties and disturbances, and the controller should compensate for such phenomena in order to provide stable performance. A multiple-shooting nonlinear model-predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. This framework benefits from suitable algorithm along with readings from various sensors for genuine real-time performance with extremely high accuracy. The controller is then tested for tracking different trajectories where it demonstrates highly desirable performance in terms of both speed and accuracy. This controller shows remarkable improvement when compared to existing nonlinear model-predictive controllers in the literature that were implemented on skid-steered mobile platforms.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints, ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence.

| **[Beyond the Final Answer: Evaluating the Reasoning Trajectories of Tool-Augmented Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02837v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity. The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation. Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning ($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of REACT-Drive.</p></details> | 13 pages,5 figures |
| **[Distributed Koopman Learning using Partial Trajectories for Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07212v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a distributed data-driven framework for dynamics learning, termed distributed deep Koopman learning using partial trajectories (DDKL-PT). In this framework, each agent in a multi-agent system is assigned a partial trajectory offline and locally approximates the unknown dynamics using a deep neural network within the Koopman operator framework. By exchanging local estimated dynamics rather than training data, agents achieve consensus on a global dynamics model without sharing their private training trajectories. Simulation studies on a surface vehicle demonstrate that DDKL-PT attains consensus with respect to the learned dynamics, with each agent achieving reasonably small approximation errors over the testing data. Furthermore, a model predictive control scheme is developed by integrating the learned Koopman dynamics with known kinematic relations. Results on goal-tracking and station-keeping tasks support that the distributedly learned dynamics are sufficiently accurate for model-based optimal control.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Trajectory Generator for High-Density Traffic and Diverse Agent-Interaction Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02627v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is fundamental to autonomous driving, as it underpins safe motion planning and collision avoidance in complex environments. However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous road environments into a structured grid representation that supports fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety. Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Best Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18873v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful approach for aligning generative models, but its reliance on learned reward models makes it vulnerable to mis-specification and reward hacking. Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) offers a more robust alternative by directly leveraging noisy binary comparisons over trajectories. We study the best policy identification problem in PbRL, motivated by post-training optimization of generative models, for example, during multi-turn interactions. Learning in this setting combines an offline preference dataset--potentially biased or out-of-distribution and collected from a rater of subpar 'competence'--with online pure exploration, making systematic online learning essential. To this end, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling that maintains posteriors over the reward model and dynamics. We provide the first Bayesian simple regret guarantees for PbRL and introduce an efficient approximation that outperforms existing baselines on simulation and image generation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCoT: Unifying Consistency Models and Rectified Flows via Straight-Consistent Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16972v4)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained diffusion models are commonly used to generate clean data (e.g., images) from random noises, effectively forming pairs of noises and corresponding clean images. Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions, whether traditional position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms, and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools. Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user preferences.</p></details> |  |

A promising direction is to leverage the generalist knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large-language models by treating unusual driving scenarios as a logical reasoning task. In this work, we present Poutine, a method that uses an off-the-shelf 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) - without any additional components - to achieve robust end-to-end autonomous driving via a simple and scalable training recipe. To learn strong base driving capabilities, we first train Poutine-Base using self-supervised next-token prediction over vision, language, and trajectory (VLT) tokens, leveraging both nominal and long-tail driving data. In the second stage, we fine-tune Poutine-Base using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a small set of human preference-labeled examples. We evaluated our approach on the Waymo end-to-end driving benchmark curated for long-tail scenarios. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. Our results suggest that handcrafted tokenizers or custom architectural components added to base VLMs in prior work are not necessary to achieve strong driving performance. Instead, this work highlights the potential of scalable VLT pretraining combined with lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Selection for Fine-tuning Vision Language Models via Cross Modal Alignment Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01454v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to the best baseline for LLaVA-665k.

Advances in robot performance have increased the hopping height to greater than 4 meters and opened up the possibility for more complex aerial trajectories (i.e., behaviors). However, currently hopping robots do not directly control their aerial trajectory or transition to flight, eliminating the efficiency benefits of a hopping system. Here we show a real-time, computationally efficiency, non-linear drag compensated, trajectory generation methodology and accompanying Lyapunov-based controller. The combined system can create and follow complex aerial trajectories from liftoff to touchdown on horizontal and vertical surfaces, while maintaining strick control over the orientation at touchdown. The computational efficiency provides broad applicability across all size scales of hopping robots while maintaining applicability to quadrotors in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v6)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer flexibility to define precise motion but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) handles high-dimensional spaces with strong robustness but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. Opt2Skill generates dynamic feasible and contact-consistent reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and trains RL policies to track these optimal trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms baselines that rely on human demonstrations and inverse kinematics-based references, both in motion tracking and task success rates. Furthermore, we show that incorporating trajectories with torque information improves contact force tracking in contact-involved tasks, such as wiping a table. We have successfully transferred our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We propose TrajVLM-Gen, a two-stage framework for physics-aware image-to-video generation. First, we employ a Vision Language Model to predict coarse-grained motion trajectories that maintain consistency with real-world physics. Second, these trajectories guide video generation through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic motion patterns. Experiments on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT demonstrate that TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive FVD scores of 545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Based Observer Design: A Framework for Lightweight Sensor Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00630v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient observer design and accurate sensor fusion are key in state estimation. This work proposes an optimization-based methodology, termed Trajectory Based Optimization Design (TBOD), allowing the user to easily design observers for general nonlinear systems and multi-sensor setups. Starting from parametrized observer dynamics, the proposed method considers a finite set of pre-recorded measurement trajectories from the nominal plant and exploits them to tune the observer parameters through numerical optimization. This research hinges on the classic observer's theory and Moving Horizon Estimators methodology. Optimization is exploited to ease the observer's design, providing the user with a lightweight, general-purpose sensor fusion methodology. TBOD's main characteristics are the capability to handle general sensors efficiently and in a modular way and, most importantly, its straightforward tuning procedure. The TBOD's performance is tested on a terrestrial rover localization problem, combining IMU and ranging sensors provided by Ultra Wide Band antennas, and validated through a motion-capture system. Comparison with an Extended Kalman Filter is also provided, matching its position estimation accuracy and significantly improving in the orientation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM) for Accelerated and Lightweight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00627v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment. This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS.

| **[What Did I Learn? Operational Competence Assessment for AI-Based Trajectory Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00619v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated driving functions increasingly rely on machine learning for tasks like perception and trajectory planning, requiring large, relevant datasets. The performance of these algorithms depends on how closely the training data matches the task. To ensure reliable functioning, it is crucial to know what is included in the dataset to assess the trained model's operational risk. We aim to enhance the safe use of machine learning in automated driving by developing a method to recognize situations that an automated vehicle has not been sufficiently trained on. This method also improves explainability by describing the dataset at a human-understandable level. We propose modeling driving data as knowledge graphs, representing driving scenes with entities and their relationships. These graphs are queried for specific sub-scene configurations to check their occurrence in the dataset. We estimate a vehicle's competence in a driving scene by considering the coverage and complexity of sub-scene configurations in the training set. Higher complexity scenes require greater coverage for high competence. We apply this method to the NuPlan dataset, modeling it with knowledge graphs and analyzing the coverage of specific driving scenes. This approach helps monitor the competence of machine learning models trained on the dataset, which is essential for trustworthy AI to be deployed in automated driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in proceedings of the 2025 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference</p></details> |
| **[From Human Hands to Robot Arms: Manipulation Skills Transfer via Trajectory Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00491v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning diverse manipulation skills for real-world robots is severely bottlenecked by the reliance on costly and hard-to-scale teleoperated demonstrations. While human videos offer a scalable alternative, effectively transferring manipulation knowledge is fundamentally hindered by the significant morphological gap between human and robotic embodiments. To address this challenge and facilitate skill transfer from human to robot, we introduce Traj2Action,a novel framework that bridges this embodiment gap by using the 3D trajectory of the operational endpoint as a unified intermediate representation, and then transfers the manipulation knowledge embedded in this trajectory to the robot's actions. Our policy first learns to generate a coarse trajectory, which forms an high-level motion plan by leveraging both human and robot data. This plan then conditions the synthesis of precise, robot-specific actions (e.g., orientation and gripper state) within a co-denoising framework. Extensive real-world experiments on a Franka robot demonstrate that Traj2Action boosts the performance by up to 27% and 22.25% over $\pi_0$ baseline on short- and long-horizon real-world tasks, and achieves significant gains as human data scales in robot policy learning.

| **[Dynamic-TreeRPO: Breaking the Independent Trajectory Bottleneck with Structured Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23352v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM) rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.</p></details> | Fig.3 updated |
| **[On the joint observability of flow fields and particle properties from Lagrangian trajectories: evidence from neural data assimilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00479v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We numerically investigate the joint observability of flow states and unknown particle properties from Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) data. LPT offers time-resolved, volumetric measurements of particle trajectories, but experimental tracks are spatially sparse, potentially noisy, and may be further complicated by inertial transport, raising the question of whether both Eulerian fields and particle characteristics can be reliably inferred. To address this, we develop a data assimilation framework that couples an Eulerian flow representation with Lagrangian particle models, enabling the simultaneous inference of carrier fields and particle properties under the governing equations of disperse multiphase flow. Using this approach, we establish empirical existence proofs of joint observability across three representative regimes. In a turbulent boundary layer with noisy tracer tracks (St to 0), flow states and true particle positions are jointly observable. In homogeneous isotropic turbulence seeded with inertial particles (St ~ 1-5), we demonstrate simultaneous recovery of flow states and particle diameters, showing the feasibility of implicit particle characterization. In a compressible, shock-dominated flow, we report the first joint reconstructions of velocity, pressure, density, and inertial particle properties (diameter and density), highlighting both the potential and certain limits of observability in supersonic regimes. Systematic sensitivity studies further reveal how seeding density, noise level, and Stokes number govern reconstruction accuracy, yielding practical guidelines for experimental design. Taken together, these results show that the scope of LPT could be broadened to multiphase and high-speed flows, in which tracer and measurement fidelity are limited.</p></details> |  |

However, existing agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE) framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2) problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic, self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging runway for agent development.</p></details> | <details><summary>his i...</summary><p>his is a work in progress due to methodology refinement and further evaluation</p></details> |

However, existing methods typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy, first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories, enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of real-world, ego-centric perception.</p></details> |  |

For rasterization and other tasks, it is often necessary to extract a mesh that represents the shape. Unbounded scenes with long-range camera trajectories, such as flying through a forest, pose a unique challenge for mesh extraction. A single static mesh representing all the geometric detail necessary for the full camera path can be prohibitively large. Therefore, independent meshes can be extracted for different camera views, but this approach may lead to popping artifacts during transitions. We propose a temporally coherent method for extracting meshes suitable for long-range camera trajectories in unbounded scenes represented by an occupancy function. The key idea is to perform 4D mesh extraction using a new spacetime tree structure called a binary-octree. Experiments show that, compared to existing baseline methods, our method offers superior visual consistency at a comparable cost.

Traditionally, nonconvex optimization problems are solved by forming and solving a sequence of convex optimization problems, where the cost and constraint functions are approximated locally through Taylor series expansions. This presents a challenge for functions where differentiation is expensive or unavailable. In this work, we present a derivative-free approach to form these convex approximations by computing samples of the dynamics, cost, and constraint functions and letting the solver interpolate between them. Our framework includes sample-based trajectory optimization techniques like model-predictive path integral (MPPI) control as a special case and generalizes them to enable features like multiple shooting and general equality and inequality constraints that are traditionally associated with derivative-based sequential convex programming methods. The resulting framework is simple, flexible, and capable of solving a wide variety of practical motion planning and control problems.</p></details> |  |

However, most of these methods require enforcing non-penetration constraints between objects, resulting in a non-trivial and computationally expensive problem. This makes the use of optimization-based methods for planning and control challenging. In this paper, we present a method to efficiently enforce non-penetration of sets while performing optimization over their configuration, which is directly applicable to problems like collision-aware trajectory optimization. We introduce novel differentiable conditions with analytic expressions to achieve this. To enforce non-collision between non-smooth bodies using these conditions, we introduce a method to approximate polytopes as smooth semi-algebraic sets. We present several numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and compare the performance with other baseline methods recently proposed in the literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures.

The majority of existing placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preemptive Spatiotemporal Trajectory Adjustment for Heterogeneous Vehicles in Highway Merging Zones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25929v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aiming at the problem of driver's perception lag and low utilization efficiency of space-time resources in expressway ramp confluence area, based on the preemptive spatiotemporal trajectory Adjustment system, from the perspective of coordinating spatiotemporal resources, the reasonable value of safe space-time distance in trajectory pre-preparation is quantitatively analyzed. The minimum safety gap required for ramp vehicles to merge into the mainline is analyzed by introducing double positioning error and spatiotemporal trajectory tracking error. A merging control strategy for autonomous driving heterogeneous vehicles is proposed, which integrates vehicle type, driving intention, and safety spatiotemporal distance. The specific confluence strategies of ramp target vehicles and mainline cooperative vehicles under different vehicle types are systematically expounded. A variety of traffic flow and speed scenarios are used for full combination simulation. By comparing the time-position-speed diagram, the vehicle operation characteristics and the dynamic difference of confluence are qualitatively analyzed, and the average speed and average delay are used as the evaluation indices to quantitatively evaluate the performance advantages of the preemptive cooperative confluence control strategy. The results show that the maximum average delay improvement rates of mainline and ramp vehicles are 90.24 % and 74.24 %, respectively. The proposed strategy can effectively avoid potential vehicle conflicts and emergency braking behaviors, improve driving safety in the confluence area, and show significant advantages in driving stability and overall traffic efficiency optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vector sketch animation generation with differentialable motion trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25857v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sketching is a direct and inexpensive means of visual expression. Though image-based sketching has been well studied, video-based sketch animation generation is still very challenging due to the temporal coherence requirement. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end automatic generation approach for vector sketch animation. To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the frame-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable polynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation across multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and temporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a Bernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus achieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency and supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods. Cross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the robustness and compatibility of our approach.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

A prominent line of research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward hacking.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[SSTP: Efficient Sample Selection for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17385v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a core task in autonomous driving. However, training advanced trajectory prediction models on existing large-scale datasets is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. More critically, these datasets are highly imbalanced in scenario density, with normal driving scenes (low-moderate traffic) overwhelmingly dominating the datasets, while high-density and safety-critical cases are underrepresented. As a result, models tend to overfit low/moderate-density scenarios and perform poorly in high-density scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the SSTP framework, which constructs a compact yet density-balanced dataset tailored to trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages: (1)Extraction, where a baseline model is pretrained for a few epochs to obtain stable gradient estimates, and the dataset is partitioned by scenario density. (2)Selection, where gradient-based scores and a submodular objective select representative samples within each density category, while biased sampling emphasizes rare high-density interactions to avoid dominance by low-density cases. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Experiments on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets with recent state-of-the-art models show that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Robust trajectory prediction depends not only on data scale but also on balancing scene density to ensure reliable performance under complex multi agent interactions.</p></details> |  |

By employing a mix of heterogeneous time-to-go formulations leading to a cooperative guidance strategy, the swarm of vehicles is able to generate diverse trajectory families. This diversity expands the feasible solution space for simultaneous target interception, enhances robustness under disturbances, and enables flexible time-to-go adjustments without predictable detouring. From an adversarial perspective, heterogeneity obscures the collective interception intent by preventing straightforward prediction of swarm dynamics, effectively acting as an encryption layer in the trajectory domain. Simulations demonstrate that the swarm of heterogeneous vehicles is able to intercept a moving target simultaneously from a diverse set of initial engagement configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[LATTE: Latent Trajectory Embedding for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03054v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This erodes trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generated image detectors that remain reliable across different generators. While recent approaches leverage diffusion denoising cues, they typically rely on single-step reconstruction errors and overlook the sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose LATTE - LATent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the evolution of latent embeddings across multiple denoising steps. Instead of treating each denoising step in isolation, LATTE captures the trajectory of these representations, revealing subtle and discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated images. Experiments on several benchmarks, such as GenImage, Chameleon, and Diffusion Forensics, show that LATTE achieves superior performance, especially in challenging cross-generator and cross-dataset scenarios, highlighting the potential of latent trajectory modeling. The code is available on the following link: https://github.com/AnaMVasilcoiu/LATTE-Diffusion-Detector.</p></details> |  |
| **[TR2-D2: Tree Search Guided Trajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25171v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control offers a promising framework for diffusion fine-tuning, where a pre-trained diffusion model is optimized to generate paths that lead to a reward-tilted distribution. While these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion (TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single- and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models, highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Hyperparameter Tuning via Trajectory Invariance Principle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25049v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As hyperparameter tuning becomes increasingly costly at scale, efficient tuning methods are essential. Yet principles for guiding hyperparameter tuning remain limited. In this work, we seek to establish such principles by considering a broad range of hyperparameters, including batch size, learning rate, and weight decay. We identify a phenomenon we call trajectory invariance, where pre-training loss curves, gradient noise, and gradient norm exhibit invariance--closely overlapping--with respect to a quantity that combines learning rate and weight decay. This phenomenon effectively reduces the original two-dimensional hyperparameter space to one dimension, yielding an efficient tuning rule: follow the salient direction revealed by trajectory invariance. Furthermore, we refine previous scaling laws and challenge several existing viewpoints. Overall, our work proposes new principles for efficient tuning and inspires future research on scaling laws.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on the comprehensive OpenAlex dataset and employing fractional counting to avoid double attribution in co-authored work, the research maps the relative shares of AI publications across major global players. The analysis reveals a profound restructuring of the international AI research landscape. The US and the European Union (EU27), once the undisputed and established leaders, have experienced a notable decline in relative dominance, with their combined share of publications falling from over 57% in 2000 to less than 25% in 2025. In contrast, China has undergone a dramatic ascent, expanding its global share of AI publications from under 5% in 2000 to nearly 36% by 2025, thereby emerging as the single most dominant contributor. Alongside China, India has also risen substantially, consolidating a multipolar Asian research ecosystem. These empirical findings highlight the strategic implications of concentrated research output, particularly China's capacity to shape the future direction of AI innovation and standard-setting. While the study calculates the volume of AI publications (in percentage as global share) as a measure of research dominance, it also acknowledges limitations in capturing quality and impact, suggesting scholarly research areas for future work on high-impact AI scholarship.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably stitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties are needed to compose: \emph{positional equivariance} and \emph{local receptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion planning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling. Experimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than positional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition, both are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple architecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive methods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based guidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable generalization in goal-conditioned settings.</p></details> | 9 Pages |
| **[Trajectory Prediction via Bayesian Intention Inference under Unknown Goals and Kinematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24928v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces an adaptive Bayesian algorithm for real-time trajectory prediction via intention inference, where a target's intentions and motion characteristics are unknown and subject to change. The method concurrently estimates two critical variables: the target's current intention, modeled as a Markovian latent state, and an intention parameter that describes the target's adherence to a shortest-path policy. By integrating this joint update technique, the algorithm maintains robustness against abrupt intention shifts and unknown motion dynamics. A sampling-based trajectory prediction mechanism then exploits these adaptive estimates to generate probabilistic forecasts with quantified uncertainty. We validate the framework through numerical experiments: Ablation studies of two cases, and a 500-trial Monte Carlo analysis; Hardware demonstrations on quadrotor and quadrupedal platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms non-adaptive and partially adaptive methods. The method operates in real time around 270 Hz without requiring training or detailed prior knowledge of target behavior, showcasing its applicability in various robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

While these approaches make more realistic motions possible, they are limited by the amount of available motion data, and do not incorporate prior knowledge about the physical laws governing the system and its interactions with the environment. Thus they may violate such laws, leading to divergent trajectories and sliding contacts which limit real-world stability. We address such limitations via a two-pronged learning strategy which leverages the known physics of the system and fundamental control principles. First, we encode physics priors during supervised imitation learning to promote trajectory feasibility. Second, we minimize drift at inference time by applying a proportional-integral controller directly to the generated output state. We validate our method on various locomotion behaviors for the ergoCub humanoid robot, where a physics-informed loss encourages zero contact foot velocity. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is compatible with multiple controllers on a real robot and significantly improves the accuracy and physical constraint conformity of generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Hangzhou, China, 2025</p></details> |

Despite its potential, data preparation, pre-training strategy development, and architectural design present significant challenges in constructing this model. Therefore, we introduce UniTraj, a Universal Trajectory foundation model that aims to address these limitations through three key innovations. First, we construct WorldTrace, an unprecedented dataset of 2.45 million trajectories with billions of GPS points spanning 70 countries, providing the diverse geographic coverage essential for region-independent modeling. Second, we develop novel pre-training strategies--Adaptive Trajectory Resampling and Self-supervised Trajectory Masking--that enable robust learning from heterogeneous trajectory data with varying sampling rates and quality. Finally, we tailor a flexible model architecture to accommodate a variety of trajectory tasks, effectively capturing complex movement patterns to support broad applicability. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior scalability, adaptability, and generalization, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal yet non-exclusive training resource.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a research paper by NeurIPS'25</p></details> |

Trajectory control represents a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However, existing methods either require substantial training resources or are specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding, STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control. Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory controllability.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we provide a multilinguistic, large-scale assessment of this similarity by systematically comparing 16 publicly available pretrained LLMs with human brain responses during natural language processing tasks in both English and Chinese. Specifically, we use ridge regression to assess the representational similarity between LLM embeddings and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and analyze the similarity between the "neural trajectory" and the "LLM latent trajectory." This method captures key dynamic patterns, such as magnitude, angle, uncertainty, and confidence. Our findings highlight both similarities and crucial differences in processing strategies: (1) We show that middle-to-high layers of LLMs are central to semantic integration and correspond to the N400 component observed in EEG; (2) The brain exhibits continuous and iterative processing during reading, whereas LLMs often show discrete, stage-end bursts of activity, which suggests a stark contrast in their real-time semantic processing dynamics. This study could offer new insights into LLMs and neural processing, and also establish a critical framework for future investigations into the alignment between artificial intelligence and biological intelligence.</p></details> |  |

We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation. Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second, action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, accepted to CoRL 2025 LSRW workshop</p></details> |

Dataset distillation offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets. Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states, overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity. Experiments on medical image classification tasks demonstrate that our method improves distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model accuracy comparable to training on the original datasets.

| **[Evaluation of Machine and Deep Learning Techniques for Cyclone Trajectory Regression and Status Classification by Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24146v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate cyclone forecasting is essential for minimizing loss of life, infrastructure damage, and economic disruption. Traditional numerical weather prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision, recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about 2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models, especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone prediction and integration into decision support systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPS-MTM: Capturing Pattern of Normalcy in GPS-Trajectories with self-supervised learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24031v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further reference.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |

Most models predict chronological age, an imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here, we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns. Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hazy Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction via Physical Priors and Graph-Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24020v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a 78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range dependency modeling. Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE / minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Masked Diffusion Language Models via Consistency Trajectory Reinforcement Learning with Fewer Decoding Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23924v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) language models, offering properties such as parallel decoding, flexible generation orders, and the potential for fewer inference steps. Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored. A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal (parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding, achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO) for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks, such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct. The results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/yjyddq/EOSER-ASS-RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables.

However, guiding these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans, appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

While LLM agents show decent effectiveness, the high computational cost of input tokens due to the ever-growing trajectory remains an efficiency concern for their applications. Efficiency is largely neglected in existing studies and agent products, and this paper fills the gap by introducing an inference-time trajectory reduction approach to reduce the cost of agents. Through analyzing existing agent trajectories, we demonstrate that useless, redundant, and expired information is widespread in all trajectories, which can be identified and reduced without harming the agent's performance. We then design a simple yet effective trajectory reduction approach, AgentDiet, which automatically removes such waste information. We implement AgentDiet on a top-performing coding agent, and the evaluation on two LLMs and two benchmarks shows that AgentDiet can reduce input tokens by 39.9% ~ 59.7%, or the final computational cost by 21.1% ~ 35.9%, while maintaining the same agent performance. This indicates that trajectory reduction is a promising direction for agent systems.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

However, their training paradigm mainly relies on manually collected successful demonstrations, making it difficult to adapt to complex environments when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or execution biases. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a closed-loop optimization framework via active trial-and-error mechanism, it suffers from sparse rewards, high variance, and unstable optimization in long-horizon robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Trajectory-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO), an online RL-based training framework for VLA models. TGRPO leverages task analysis generated by a large language model to automatically construct dense reward functions, providing fine-grained feedback to accelerate convergence and improve credit assignment. The core of our method is a group-based strategy that samples and normalizes multiple trajectories in parallel, reducing variance through relative comparison. By integrating trajectory-level and step-level advantage estimation, TGRPO captures both global and local optimization signals without relying on a value network. Experiments on four task categories of the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TGRPO achieves an average success rate of 80.7\%, which is 4.2\% higher than that of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and outperforms other representative RL-based post-training methods.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on raw visual data such as camera images, our method utilizes highly compressed and informative BEV representations, which are generated by fusing multi-modal sensor data (e.g., camera and LiDAR) and aligning them with HD Maps. This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate 44.8% improvements in planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance. Our work highlights that VLMs can effectively interpret processed visual representations like BEV features, expanding their applicability beyond raw images in trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion Trajectory Alignment via Stepwise Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04832v2)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we propose an offline preference optimization method to approach trajectory alignment for discrete diffusion models. Instead of applying the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise alignment objectives by matching the per-step posterior. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization, is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, yields an equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design, protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 81.2 on LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |

While reinforcement learning offers a potential solution, it suffers from sparse rewards and the limited reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Meanwhile, existing data synthesis methods only produce chain-of-thought rationales and fail to model environmental interactions. In this paper, we propose EviPath, an evidence-anchored reasoning path synthesis paradigm for RAG agent development. EviPath comprises: (i) Abductive Subtask Planning, which decomposes the problem into sub-questions and iteratively plans an optimal solution path based on the dependencies between them; (ii) Faithful Sub-question Answering, which uses supporting evidence to construct a proxy environment to generate reasoning thoughts and answers for each sub-question; and (iii) Conversational Fine-Tuning, which formats the complete agent-environment interaction trajectory into a dialogue format suitable for Supervised Fine-Tuning. EviPath allows LLMs to learn complex reasoning and tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data. Extensive experiments on widely-used question-answering benchmarks show that an 8B parameter model trained with EviPath-synthesized data significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a double-digit absolute EM gain of 14.7% in open-domain question answering.</p></details> |  |

With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios: weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance, which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative models for interactive systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Proxy: Trajectory-Distilled Guidance for Offline GFlowNet Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20110v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are effective at sampling diverse, high-reward objects, but in many real-world settings where new reward queries are infeasible, they must be trained from offline datasets. The prevailing proxy-based training methods are susceptible to error propagation, while existing proxy-free approaches often use coarse constraints that limit exploration. To address these issues, we propose Trajectory-Distilled GFlowNet (TD-GFN), a novel proxy-free training framework. TD-GFN learns dense, transition-level edge rewards from offline trajectories via inverse reinforcement learning to provide rich structural guidance for efficient exploration. Crucially, to ensure robustness, these rewards are used indirectly to guide the policy through DAG pruning and prioritized backward sampling of training trajectories. This ensures that final gradient updates depend only on ground-truth terminal rewards from the dataset, thereby preventing the error propagation. Experiments show that TD-GFN significantly outperforms a broad range of existing baselines in both convergence speed and final sample quality, establishing a more robust and efficient paradigm for offline GFlowNet training.</p></details> |  |

We propose AnchDrive, a framework for end-to-end driving that effectively bootstraps a diffusion policy to mitigate the high computational cost of traditional generative models. Rather than denoising from pure noise, AnchDrive initializes its planner with a rich set of hybrid trajectory anchors. These anchors are derived from two complementary sources: a static vocabulary of general driving priors and a set of dynamic, context-aware trajectories. The dynamic trajectories are decoded in real-time by a Transformer that processes dense and sparse perceptual features. The diffusion model then learns to refine these anchors by predicting a distribution of trajectory offsets, enabling fine-grained refinement. This anchor-based bootstrapping design allows for efficient generation of diverse, high-quality trajectories. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark confirm that AnchDrive sets a new state-of-the-art and shows strong generalizability</p></details> |  |
| **[R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17307v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but incurs substantial inference cost due to long autoregressive trajectories. Existing acceleration strategies either shorten traces via early stopping or compression, or adopt speculative decoding with a smaller model. However, speculative decoding provides limited gains when model agreement is low and rigidly enforces token-level consistency, overlooking the observation that some smaller models, when correct, produce significantly more concise reasoning traces that could reduce inference length. We introduce R-Stitch, a training-free hybrid decoding framework that leverages token-level entropy as an uncertainty proxy to delegate computation between a small language model (SLM) and an LLM. Our analysis shows that high-entropy tokens are more likely to induce errors, motivating an entropy-guided routing strategy that lets the SLM efficiently handle low-entropy tokens while delegating uncertain ones to the LLM, thereby avoiding full rollbacks and preserving answer quality. We further extend this design with R-Stitch$^{+}$, which learns an adaptive routing policy to adjust the token budget dynamically beyond fixed thresholds. By jointly reducing per-token decoding complexity and the number of generated tokens, our method achieves substantial acceleration with negligible accuracy loss. Concretely, it attains peak speedups of 3.00$\times$ on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, 3.85$\times$ on 14B, and 4.10$\times$ on QWQ-32B while maintaining accuracy comparable to full LLM decoding. Moreover, it naturally enables adaptive efficiency--accuracy trade-offs that can be tailored to diverse computational budgets without retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

In FedAVG multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing robust defense strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[FAST: Foreground-aware Diffusion with Accelerated Sampling Trajectory for Segmentation-oriented Anomaly Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20295v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations, yet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label. Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step, preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream segmentation tasks. We release the code at: https://github.com/Chhro123/fast-foreground-aware-anomaly-synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowDrive: moderated flow matching with data balancing for trajectory planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21961v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based planners are sensitive to the long-tailed distribution of driving data. Common maneuvers dominate datasets, while dangerous or rare scenarios are sparse. This imbalance can bias models toward the frequent cases and degrade performance on critical scenarios. To tackle this problem, we compare balancing strategies for sampling training data and find reweighting by trajectory pattern an effective approach. We then present FlowDrive, a flow-matching trajectory planner that learns a conditional rectified flow to map noise directly to trajectory distributions with few flow-matching steps. We further introduce moderated, in-the-loop guidance that injects small perturbation between flow steps to systematically increase trajectory diversity while remaining scene-consistent. On nuPlan and the interaction-focused interPlan benchmarks, FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based planners and approaches methods with rule-based refinements. After adding moderated guidance and light post-processing (FlowDrive*), it achieves overall state-of-the-art performance across nearly all benchmark splits.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a framework for generating moving sounds given text prompts in a controllable fashion. To enable training, we construct a synthetic dataset that records moving sounds in binaural format, their spatial trajectories, and text captions about the sound event and spatial motion. Using this dataset, we train a text-to-trajectory prediction model that outputs the three-dimensional trajectory of a moving sound source given text prompts. To generate spatial audio, we first fine-tune a pre-trained text-to-audio generative model to output temporally aligned mono sound with the trajectory. The spatial audio is then simulated using the predicted temporally-aligned trajectory. Experimental evaluation demonstrates reasonable spatial understanding of the text-to-trajectory model. This approach could be easily integrated into existing text-to-audio generative workflow and extended to moving sound generation in other spatial audio formats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plan-R1: Safe and Feasible Trajectory Planning as Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17659v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe and feasible trajectory planning is critical for real-world autonomous driving systems. However, existing learning-based planners rely heavily on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting undesirable behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a two-stage trajectory planning framework that decouples principle alignment from behavior learning. In the first stage, a general trajectory predictor is pre-trained on expert data to capture diverse, human-like driving behaviors. In the second stage, the model is fine-tuned with rule-based rewards using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), explicitly aligning ego planning with principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. This two-stage paradigm retains human-like behaviors while enhancing safety awareness and discarding undesirable patterns from demonstrations. Furthermore, we identify a key limitation of directly applying GRPO to planning: group-wise normalization erases cross-group scale differences, causing rare, high-variance safety-violation groups to have similar advantages as abundant low-variance safe groups, thereby suppressing optimization for safety-critical objectives. To address this, we propose Variance-Decoupled GRPO (VD-GRPO), which replaces normalization with centering and fixed scaling to preserve absolute reward magnitudes, ensuring that safety-critical objectives remain dominant throughout training. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance, particularly in realistic reactive settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/XiaolongTang23/Plan-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aircraft Trajectory Dataset Augmentation in Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07585v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aircraft trajectory modeling plays a crucial role in air traffic management (ATM) and is important for various downstream tasks, including conflict detection and landing time prediction. Dataset augmentation by adding synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is sufficient and balanced. We propose a novel framework called ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework, a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned latent space. The converted dataset is projected to reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original dimension, and the samples are decoded with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Several experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new, high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the results of several baselines.</p></details> |  |

Anticipating Future Motion by Generating Point Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21592v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e., predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating pixels rather than directly modeling motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[\LARGE GMP$^{3}$: Learning-Driven, Bellman-Guided Trajectory Planning for UAVs in Real-Time on SE(3)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21264v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose $\text{GMP}^{3}$, a multiphase global path planning framework that generates dynamically feasible three-dimensional trajectories for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in cluttered environments. The framework extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in constrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation.

Existing approaches often attempt to learn these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.</p></details> | ICME2025 |

However, we find that the perpendicular component of the pushing force from negative samples in contrastive learning is a double-edged sword: it contains rich supplementary information from negative samples, yet its unconstrained nature causes optimization trajectory drift and training instability. To address this, we propose Support Vector Regularization (SVR), a method that introduces an auxiliary support vector to control this perpendicular component, aiming to harness its rich information while mitigating the associated trajectory drift. The efficacy of SVR is critically governed by its semantic radius, for which we explore two unsupervised modeling strategies: direct parameterization and an adaptive radius predictor module enhanced with constraints to improve its predicting accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses widely used baselines like InfoNCE and SigLIP loss across classification, monolingual retrieval, and multilingual retrieval on standard audio-text datasets. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results on optimizing trajectory drift validate the correctness and effectiveness of our SVR method.</p></details> |  |

However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging. One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention, which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted for IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation System</p></details> |

Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection) to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit ``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.</p></details> | <details><summary>20pag...</summary><p>20pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization (JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics. To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to $\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning, and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling.

However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.

The framework integrates a two-stage nonlinear optimization pipeline that balances efficiency, safety and smoothness. Experimental results demonstrate that C-3TO produces collision-aware and dynamically feasible trajectories. Moreover, its flexibility in defining local window sizes and optimization parameters enables straightforward adaptation to diverse user's needs without compromising performance. By combining continuous trajectory parameterization with a continuously updated neural ESDF, C-3TO establishes a robust and generalizable foundation for safe and efficient local replanning in aerial robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ICRA 2026</p></details> |

Existing corridor based planners which rely on decomposition of the free space into collision free subsets scale poorly with environmental complexity and require explicit allocations of time windows to trajectory segments. We introduce a new trajectory parameterization that represents trajectories in a nonconvex collision free corridor as being in a convex cartesian product of balls. This parameterization allows us to decouple problem size from geometric complexity of the solution and naturally avoids explicit time allocation by allowing trajectories to evolve continuously inside ellipsoidal corridors. Building on this representation, we formulate the Orthogonal Trust Region Problem (Orth-TRP), a specialized convex program with separable block constraints, and develop a solver that exploits this parallel structure and the unique structure of each parallel subproblem for efficient optimization. Experiments on a quadrotor trajectory planning benchmark show that our approach produces smoother trajectories and lower runtimes than state-of-the-art corridor based planners, especially in highly complicated environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmenting Multi-Agent Communication with State Delta Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19209v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing multi-agent systems constructed from a single base LLM mostly use natural language for agent communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability, it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample its continuous state vectors to discrete tokens before transferring them to the other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process. We propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols, particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |

We identify a new vulnerability, LLMs generating convincing career trajectories in fake resumes and explore effective detection methods. To address this challenge, we construct a dataset of machine-generated career trajectories using LLMs and various methods, and demonstrate that conventional text-based detectors perform poorly on structured career data. We propose CareerScape, a novel heterogeneous, hierarchical multi-layer graph framework that models career entities and their relations in a unified global graph built from genuine resumes. Unlike conventional classifiers that treat each instance independently, CareerScape employs a structure-aware framework that augments user-specific subgraphs with trusted neighborhood information from a global graph, enabling the model to capture both global structural patterns and local inconsistencies indicative of synthetic career paths. Experimental results show that CareerScape outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5.8-85.0% relatively, highlighting the importance of structure-aware detection for machine-generated content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Main</p></details> |

| **[LEAML: Label-Efficient Adaptation to Out-of-Distribution Visual Tasks for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03232v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering, enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML framework.</p></details> |  |

However, as reasoning chains extend, critical intermediate steps and the original prompt will be buried in the context, receiving insufficient attention and leading to errors. In this paper, we propose Self-Anchor, a novel pipeline that leverages the inherent structure of reasoning to steer LLM attention. Self-Anchor decomposes reasoning trajectories into structured plans and automatically aligns the model's attention to the most relevant inference steps, allowing the model to maintain focus throughout generation. Our experiment shows that Self-Anchor outperforms SOTA prompting methods across six benchmarks. Notably, Self-Anchor significantly reduces the performance gap between ``non-reasoning'' models and specialized reasoning models, with the potential to enable most LLMs to tackle complex reasoning tasks without retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cache-to-Cache: Direct Semantic Communication Between Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03215v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size, supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus, we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5% higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average 2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/C2C.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLAMAFUZZ: Large Language Model Enhanced Greybox Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07714v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Greybox fuzzing has achieved success in revealing bugs and vulnerabilities in programs. However, randomized mutation strategies have limited the fuzzer's performance on structured data. Specialized fuzzers can handle complex structured data, but require additional efforts in grammar and suffer from low throughput. In this paper, we explore the potential of utilizing the Large Language Model to enhance greybox fuzzing for structured data. We utilize the pre-trained knowledge of LLM about data conversion and format to generate new valid inputs. We further fine-tuned it with paired mutation seeds to learn structured format and mutation strategies effectively. Our LLM-based fuzzer, LLAMAFUZZ, integrates the power of LLM to understand and mutate structured data to fuzzing. We conduct experiments on the standard bug-based benchmark Magma and a wide variety of real-world programs. LLAMAFUZZ outperforms our top competitor by 41 bugs on average. We also identified 47 unique bugs across all trials. Moreover, LLAMAFUZZ demonstrated consistent performance on both bug trigger and bug reached. Compared to AFL++, LLAMAFUZZ achieved 27.19% more branches in real-world program sets on average. We also demonstrate a case study to explain how LLMs enhance the fuzzing process in terms of code coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[FocusAgent: Simple Yet Effective Ways of Trimming the Large Context of Web Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03204v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) must process lengthy web page observations to complete user goals; these pages often exceed tens of thousands of tokens. This saturates context limits and increases computational cost processing; moreover, processing full pages exposes agents to security risks such as prompt injection. Existing pruning strategies either discard relevant content or retain irrelevant context, leading to suboptimal action prediction. We introduce FocusAgent, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a lightweight LLM retriever to extract the most relevant lines from accessibility tree (AxTree) observations, guided by task goals. By pruning noisy and irrelevant content, FocusAgent enables efficient reasoning while reducing vulnerability to injection attacks. Experiments on WorkArena and WebArena benchmarks show that FocusAgent matches the performance of strong baselines, while reducing observation size by over 50%. Furthermore, a variant of FocusAgent significantly reduces the success rate of prompt-injection attacks, including banner and pop-up attacks, while maintaining task success performance in attack-free settings. Our results highlight that targeted LLM-based retrieval is a practical and robust strategy for building web agents that are efficient, effective, and secure.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Large Language Models are Reliable for Judging Empathic Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10150v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts, crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks, LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as conversational companions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Final Layer: Intermediate Representations for Better Multilingual Calibration in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03136v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidence calibration, the alignment of a model's predicted confidence with its actual accuracy, is crucial for the reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this critical property remains largely under-explored in multilingual contexts. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale, systematic studies of multilingual calibration across six model families and over 100 languages, revealing that non-English languages suffer from systematically worse calibration. To diagnose this, we investigate the model's internal representations and find that the final layer, biased by English-centric training, provides a poor signal for multilingual confidence. In contrast, our layer-wise analysis uncovers a key insight that late-intermediate layers consistently offer a more reliable and better-calibrated signal. Building on this, we introduce a suite of training-free methods, including Language-Aware Confidence Ensemble (LACE), which adaptively selects an optimal ensemble of layers for each specific language. Our study highlights the hidden costs of English-centric alignment and offer a new path toward building more globally equitable and trustworthy LLMs by looking beyond the final layer.</p></details> |  |
| **[C2AL: Cohort-Contrastive Auxiliary Learning for Large-scale Recommendation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02215v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large-scale recommendation models under a single global objective implicitly assumes homogeneity across user populations. However, real-world data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns, neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models. Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16% reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on targeted minority cohorts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

A continuation-based formulation is presented for tracing any single eigenvalue of interest, which supports sparse matrix representations and accommodates both explicit and semi-implicit differential-algebraic models. Key implementation aspects, such as numerical integration, matrix updates, derivative approximations, and handling defective eigenvalues, are discussed in detail and practical recommendations are duly provided. The tracking approach is demonstrated through a comprehensive case study on the IEEE 39-bus system, as well as on a realistic dynamic model of the Irish transmission system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amelia: A Large Dataset and Benchmark for Airport Surface Movement Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21185v4)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Demand for air travel is rising, straining existing aviation infrastructure. In the US, more than 90% of airport control towers are understaffed, falling short of FAA and union standards. This, in part, has contributed to an uptick in near-misses and safety-critical events, highlighting the need for advancements in air traffic management technologies to ensure safe and efficient operations. Data-driven predictive models for terminal airspace show potential to address these challenges; however, the lack of large-scale surface movement datasets in the public domain has hindered the development of scalable and generalizable approaches. To address this, we introduce Amelia-42, a first-of-its-kind large collection of raw airport surface movement reports streamed through the FAA's System Wide Information Management (SWIM) Program, comprising over two years of trajectory data (~9.19 TB) across 42 US airports. We open-source tools to process this data into clean tabular position reports. We release Amelia42-Mini, a 15-day sample per airport, fully processed data on HuggingFace for ease of use. We also present a trajectory forecasting benchmark consisting of Amelia10-Bench, an accessible experiment family using 292 days from 10 airports, as well as Amelia-TF, a transformer-based baseline for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. All resources are available at our website: https://ameliacmu.github.io and https://huggingface.co/AmeliaCMU.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 19 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Query-Level Uncertainty in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09669v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is important for Large Language Models (LLMs) to be aware of the boundary of their knowledge, distinguishing queries they can confidently answer from those that lie beyond their capabilities. Such awareness enables models to perform adaptive inference, such as invoking retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), engaging in slow and deep thinking, or abstaining from answering when appropriate. These mechanisms are key to developing efficient and trustworthy AI. In this work, we propose a method to detect knowledge boundaries via Query-Level Uncertainty, which estimates if a model is capable of answering a given query before generating any tokens, thus avoiding the generation cost. To this end, we propose a novel, training-free method called Internal Confidence, which leverages self-evaluations across layers and tokens to provide a reliable signal of uncertainty. Empirical studies on both factual question answering and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our Internal Confidence outperforms several baselines in quality of confidence while being computationally cheaper. Furthermore, we demonstrate its benefits in adaptive inference settings, showing that for RAG and model cascading it reduces inference costs while preserving overall performance.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Ranked from Within: Ranking Large Multimodal Models Without Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06461v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can the relative performance of a pre-trained large multimodal model (LMM) be predicted without access to labels? As LMMs proliferate, it becomes increasingly important to develop efficient ways to choose between them when faced with new data or tasks. The usual approach does the equivalent of giving the models an exam and marking them. We opt to avoid marking and the associated labor of determining the ground-truth answers. Instead, we explore other signals elicited and ascertain how well the models know their own limits, evaluating the effectiveness of these signals at unsupervised model ranking. We evaluate $47$ state-of-the-art LMMs (\eg, LLaVA) across $9$ visual question answering benchmarks, analyzing how well uncertainty-based metrics can predict relative model performance. Our findings show that uncertainty scores derived from softmax distributions provide a robust and consistent basis for ranking models across various tasks. This facilitates the ranking of LMMs on unlabeled data, providing a practical approach for selecting models for diverse target domains without requiring manual annotation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |
| **[Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical Evidence: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation System for Querying UK NICE Clinical Guidelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02967v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for querying the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines using Large Language Models (LLMs). The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede their utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this project addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users with precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The system's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was evaluated against a database of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred guidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten retrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries. The most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the generation phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy question-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in performance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the source text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the RAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused Meditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. This, combined with a perfect Context Precision score of 1 for all RAG-enhanced models, confirms the system's ability to prevent information fabrication by grounding its answers in relevant source material. This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling cost-effective access to medical guidelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[External Data Extraction Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02964v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, RAG has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs). By integrating externally retrieved information, RAG alleviates issues like outdated knowledge and, crucially, insufficient domain expertise. While effective, RAG introduces new risks of external data extraction attacks (EDEAs), where sensitive or copyrighted data in its knowledge base may be extracted verbatim. These risks are particularly acute when RAG is used to customize specialized LLM applications with private knowledge bases. Despite initial studies exploring these risks, they often lack a formalized framework, robust attack performance, and comprehensive evaluation, leaving critical questions about real-world EDEA feasibility unanswered. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study to formalize EDEAs against retrieval-augmented LLMs. We first formally define EDEAs and propose a unified framework decomposing their design into three components: extraction instruction, jailbreak operator, and retrieval trigger, under which prior attacks can be considered instances within our framework. Guided by this framework, we develop SECRET: a Scalable and EffeCtive exteRnal data Extraction aTtack. Specifically, SECRET incorporates (1) an adaptive optimization process using LLMs as optimizers to generate specialized jailbreak prompts for EDEAs, and (2) cluster-focused triggering, an adaptive strategy that alternates between global exploration and local exploitation to efficiently generate effective retrieval triggers. Extensive evaluations across 4 models reveal that SECRET significantly outperforms previous attacks, and is highly effective against all 16 tested RAG instances. Notably, SECRET successfully extracts 35% of the data from RAG powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet for the first time, whereas other attacks yield 0% extraction. Our findings call for attention to this emerging threat.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leave No TRACE: Black-box Detection of Copyrighted Dataset Usage in Large Language Models via Watermarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02962v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on smaller, domain-specific datasets to improve downstream performance. These datasets often contain proprietary or copyrighted material, raising the need for reliable safeguards against unauthorized use. Existing membership inference attacks (MIAs) and dataset-inference methods typically require access to internal signals such as logits, while current black-box approaches often rely on handcrafted prompts or a clean reference dataset for calibration, both of which limit practical applicability. Watermarking is a promising alternative, but prior techniques can degrade text quality or reduce task performance. We propose TRACE, a practical framework for fully black-box detection of copyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning. \texttt{TRACE} rewrites datasets with distortion-free watermarks guided by a private key, ensuring both text quality and downstream utility. At detection time, we exploit the radioactivity effect of fine-tuning on watermarked data and introduce an entropy-gated procedure that selectively scores high-uncertainty tokens, substantially amplifying detection power. Across diverse datasets and model families, TRACE consistently achieves significant detections (p<0.05), often with extremely strong statistical evidence. Furthermore, it supports multi-dataset attribution and remains robust even after continued pretraining on large non-watermarked corpora. These results establish TRACE as a practical route to reliable black-box verification of copyrighted dataset usage. We will make our code available at: https://github.com/NusIoraPrivacy/TRACE.</p></details> |  |
| **[OffTopicEval: When Large Language Models Enter the Wrong Chat, Almost Always!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26495v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval, an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the strongest models - Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96% - fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in the 62-73% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48-70%), and Gemma and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53% and 23.84%, respectively. While operational safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground provides consistent gains of up to 23%, while P-ground delivers even larger boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27%. These results highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPT and Prejudice: A Sparse Approach to Understanding Learned Representations in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01252v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive, uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse, interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery, and model interpretability at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Co-rewarding: Stable Self-supervised RL for Eliciting Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00410v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is effective to improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), its reliance on human-annotated labels leads to the scaling up dilemma, especially for complex tasks. Recent self-rewarding methods investigate a label-free alternative to unlock the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, yet they frequently encounter the non-negligible training collapse issue, as the single-view supervision signal easily forms the self-consistent illusion, yielding the reward hacking. Inspired by the success of self-supervised learning, we propose \textit{Co-rewarding}, a novel self-supervised RL framework that improves training stability by seeking complementary supervision from another views. Specifically, we instantiate Co-rewarding in two ways: (1) \textit{Co-rewarding-I} is a data-side instantiation that derives reward signals from contrastive agreement across semantically analogous questions; and (2) \textit{Co-rewarding-II} is a model-side instantiation that maintains a slowly-updated reference teacher with pseudo labels to realize self-distillation. Intuitively, such instantiations introduce different levels of discrepancy to increase the difficulty of training collapse on trivial reasoning solutions. Empirically, Co-rewarding exhibits stable training across various setups, and outperforms other self-rewarding baselines by $+3.31\%$ improvements on average on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, especially by $+7.49\%$ on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct. Notably, Co-rewarding reaches or even surpasses RLVR with ground-truth (GT) label in several cases, such as a Pass@$1$ of $94.01\%$ on GSM8K with Qwen3-8B-Base remarkably higher than GT. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/tmlr-group/Co-rewarding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Carotid Risk Stratification with Large Vision-Language Models: Benchmarking, Fine-Tuning, and Clinical Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02922v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians. This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic, laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed, comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy, while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction, underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and domain adaptation for clinical translation.</p></details> |  |

While decoding-time strategies provide a promising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat token-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint dynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware, layer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types with their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation. Through empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation tokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens govern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing attention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the induction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to guide the final factual decoding. Our method requires no additional training or model modification, and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently improves factuality across multiple LLMs and various benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The submission was made before undergoing the required review by the co-authors' affiliated institutions.

Unlike autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves 92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods. DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Models for IUCN Red List Species Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02830v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted in conservation to address the biodiversity crisis, yet their reliability for species evaluation is uncertain. This study systematically validates five leading models on 21,955 species across four core IUCN Red List assessment components: taxonomy, conservation status, distribution, and threats. A critical paradox was revealed: models excelled at taxonomic classification (94.9%) but consistently failed at conservation reasoning (27.2% for status assessment). This knowledge-reasoning gap, evident across all models, suggests inherent architectural constraints, not just data limitations. Furthermore, models exhibited systematic biases favoring charismatic vertebrates, potentially amplifying existing conservation inequities. These findings delineate clear boundaries for responsible LLM deployment: they are powerful tools for information retrieval but require human oversight for judgment-based decisions. A hybrid approach is recommended, where LLMs augment expert capacity while human experts retain sole authority over risk assessment and policy.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

However, how a persona prompt is formulated can significantly affect outcomes, raising concerns about the fidelity of such simulations. Using five open-source LLMs, we systematically examine how different persona prompt strategies, specifically role adoption formats and demographic priming strategies, influence LLM simulations across 15 intersectional demographic groups in both open- and closed-ended tasks. Our findings show that LLMs struggle to simulate marginalized groups but that the choice of demographic priming and role adoption strategy significantly impacts their portrayal. Specifically, we find that prompting in an interview-style format and name-based priming can help reduce stereotyping and improve alignment.

Recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can serve as reliable and interpretable sentence-level translation evaluators via MQM error span annotations. With modern LLMs supporting larger context windows, a natural question arises: can we feed entire document translations into an LLM for quality assessment? Ideally, evaluation should be invariant to text length, producing consistent error spans regardless of input granularity. However, our analysis shows that text length significantly impacts evaluation: longer texts lead to fewer error spans and reduced system ranking accuracy. To address this limitation, we evaluate several strategies, including granularity-aligned prompting, Focus Sentence Prompting (FSP), and a fine-tuning approach to better align LLMs with the evaluation task. The latter two methods largely mitigate this length bias, making LLMs more reliable for long-form translation evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Quantifying Long-Range Interactions in Graph Machine Learning: a Large Graph Dataset and a Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09008v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-range dependencies are critical for effective graph representation learning, yet most existing datasets focus on small graphs tailored to inductive tasks, offering limited insight into long-range interactions. Current evaluations primarily compare models employing global attention (e.g., graph transformers) with those using local neighborhood aggregation (e.g., message-passing neural networks) without a direct measurement of long-range dependency. In this work, we introduce City-Networks, a novel large-scale transductive learning dataset derived from real-world city road networks. This dataset features graphs with over 100k nodes and significantly larger diameters than those in existing benchmarks, naturally embodying long-range information. We annotate the graphs based on local node eccentricities, ensuring that the classification task inherently requires information from distant nodes. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic measurement based on the Jacobians of neighbors from distant hops, offering a principled quantification of long-range dependencies. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications for both our dataset design and the proposed measurement-particularly by focusing on over-smoothing and influence score dilution-which establishes a robust foundation for further exploration of long-range interactions in graph neural networks.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[The Path of Self-Evolving Large Language Models: Achieving Data-Efficient Learning via Intrinsic Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02752v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but such training typically demands substantial efforts in creating and annotating data. In this work, we explore improving LLMs through RL with minimal data. Our approach alternates between the LLM proposing a task and then attempting to solve it. To minimize data dependency, we introduce two novel mechanisms grounded in self-awareness: (1) self-aware difficulty prediction, where the model learns to assess task difficulty relative to its own abilities and prioritize challenging yet solvable tasks, and (2) self-aware limit breaking, where the model recognizes when a task is beyond its capability boundary and proactively requests external data to break through that limit. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks showing a 53.8% relative improvement with less than 1.2% extra data demonstrate the efficacy of self-aware RL and underscore the promise of self-evolving agent training.</p></details> |  |
| **[A $1000\times$ Faster LLM-enhanced Algorithm For Path Planning in Large-scale Grid Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02716v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Path planning in grid maps, arising from various applications, has garnered significant attention. Existing methods, such as A*, Dijkstra, and their variants, work well for small-scale maps but fail to address large-scale ones due to high search time and memory consumption. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in path planning but still suffer from spatial illusion and poor planning performance. Among all the works, LLM-A* \cite{meng2024llm} leverages LLM to generate a series of waypoints and then uses A* to plan the paths between the neighboring waypoints. In this way, the complete path is constructed. However, LLM-A* still suffers from high computational time for large-scale maps. To fill this gap, we conducted a deep investigation into LLM-A* and found its bottleneck, resulting in limited performance. Accordingly, we design an innovative LLM-enhanced algorithm, abbr. as iLLM-A*. iLLM-A* includes 3 carefully designed mechanisms, including the optimization of A*, an incremental learning method for LLM to generate high-quality waypoints, and the selection of the appropriate waypoints for A* for path planning. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation on various grid maps shows that, compared with LLM-A*, iLLM-A* \textbf{1) achieves more than $1000\times$ speedup on average, and up to $2349.5\times$ speedup in the extreme case, 2) saves up to $58.6\%$ of the memory cost, 3) achieves both obviously shorter path length and lower path length standard deviation.}</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-To-Inconsistency: A Survival Analysis of Large Language Model Robustness to Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02712v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments, failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present the first comprehensive survival analysis of conversational AI robustness, analyzing 36,951 conversation turns across 9 state-of-the-art LLMs to model failure as a time-to-event process. Our survival modeling framework-employing Cox proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest approaches-reveals extraordinary temporal dynamics. We find that abrupt, prompt-to-prompt(P2P) semantic drift is catastrophic, dramatically increasing the hazard of conversational failure. In stark contrast, gradual, cumulative drift is highly protective, vastly reducing the failure hazard and enabling significantly longer dialogues. AFT models with interactions demonstrate superior performance, achieving excellent discrimination and exceptional calibration. These findings establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm for evaluating LLM robustness, offer concrete insights for designing resilient conversational agents, and challenge prevailing assumptions about the necessity of semantic consistency in conversational AI Systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Review on Harnessing Large Language Models to Overcome Recommender System Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21117v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have traditionally followed modular architectures comprising candidate generation, multi-stage ranking, and re-ranking, each trained separately with supervised objectives and hand-engineered features. While effective in many domains, such systems face persistent challenges including sparse and noisy interaction data, cold-start problems, limited personalization depth, and inadequate semantic understanding of user and item content. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new paradigm for addressing these limitations through unified, language-native mechanisms that can generalize across tasks, domains, and modalities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive technical survey of how LLMs can be leveraged to tackle key challenges in modern recommender systems. We examine the use of LLMs for prompt-driven candidate retrieval, language-native ranking, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and conversational recommendation, illustrating how these approaches enhance personalization, semantic alignment, and interpretability without requiring extensive task-specific supervision. LLMs further enable zero- and few-shot reasoning, allowing systems to operate effectively in cold-start and long-tail scenarios by leveraging external knowledge and contextual cues. We categorize these emerging LLM-driven architectures and analyze their effectiveness in mitigating core bottlenecks of conventional pipelines. In doing so, we provide a structured framework for understanding the design space of LLM-enhanced recommenders, and outline the trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and real-time performance. Our goal is to demonstrate that LLMs are not merely auxiliary components but foundational enablers for building more adaptive, semantically rich, and user-centric recommender systems</p></details> |  |

Yet, in dynamic and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak, a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution. EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for real-world optimization problems.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Improvement in Multimodal Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02665v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in self-improvement for Large Language Models (LLMs) have efficiently enhanced model capabilities without significantly increasing costs, particularly in terms of human effort. While this area is still relatively young, its extension to the multimodal domain holds immense potential for leveraging diverse data sources and developing more general self-improving models. This survey is the first to provide a comprehensive overview of self-improvement in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). We provide a structured overview of the current literature and discuss methods from three perspectives: 1) data collection, 2) data organization, and 3) model optimization, to facilitate the further development of self-improvement in MLLMs. We also include commonly used evaluations and downstream applications. Finally, we conclude by outlining open challenges and future research directions.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |
| **[When Long Helps Short: How Context Length in Supervised Fine-tuning Affects Behavior of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18762v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language processing (NLP) tasks. As real-world applications increasingly demand longer context windows, continued pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context data has become a common approach. While the effects of data length in continued pretraining have been extensively studied, their implications for SFT remain unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate how SFT data length influences LLM behavior on short-context tasks. Counterintuitively, we find that long-context SFT improves short-context performance, contrary to the commonly observed degradation from long-context pretraining. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon, we first decouple and analyze two key components, Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN), and show that both independently benefit from long-context SFT. We further study their interaction and reveal a knowledge preference bias: long-context SFT promotes contextual knowledge, while short-context SFT favors parametric knowledge, making exclusive reliance on long-context SFT suboptimal. Finally, we demonstrate that hybrid training mitigates this bias, offering explainable guidance for fine-tuning LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[TutorBench: A Benchmark To Assess Tutoring Capabilities Of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02663v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids, it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive, provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring, samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively, with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\%$ pass rate on rubric criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated benchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoT: Structured-of-Thought Prompting Guides Multilingual Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02648v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to engage in complex reasoning tasks through deep thinking. However, the capacity of reasoning has not been successfully transferred to non-high-resource languages due to resource constraints, which struggles with multilingual reasoning tasks. To this end, we propose Structured-of-Thought (SoT), a training-free method that improves the performance on multilingual reasoning through a multi-step transformation: Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge Transformation. The SoT method converts language-specific semantic information into language-agnostic structured representations, enabling the models to understand the query in different languages more sophisticated. Besides, SoT effectively guides LLMs toward more concentrated reasoning to maintain consistent underlying reasoning pathways when handling cross-lingual variations in expression. Experimental results demonstrate that SoT outperforms several strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks when adapting to various backbones of LLMs. It can also be integrated with other training-free strategies for further improvements.

However, while most prior studies focus on improving accuracy and reasoning abilities, a significant bottleneck in developing effective healthcare agents lies in the readability of LLM-generated responses, specifically, their ability to answer public health problems clearly and simply to people without medical backgrounds. In this work, we introduce RephQA, a benchmark for evaluating the readability of LLMs in public health question answering (QA). It contains 533 expert-reviewed QA pairs from 27 sources across 13 topics, and includes a proxy multiple-choice task to assess informativeness, along with two readability metrics: Flesch-Kincaid grade level and professional score. Evaluation of 25 LLMs reveals that most fail to meet readability standards, highlighting a gap between reasoning and effective communication. To address this, we explore four readability-enhancing strategies-standard prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and a token-adapted variant. Token-adapted GRPO achieves the best results, advancing the development of more practical and user-friendly public health agents. These results represent a step toward building more practical agents for public health.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM K...</summary><p>ACM KDD Health Track 2025 Blue Sky Best Paper</p></details> |

Recent diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) enable parallel token generation through iterative denoising. However, current parallel decoding strategies rely on fixed, input-agnostic heuristics (e.g., confidence thresholds), which fail to adapt to input-specific characteristics, resulting in suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs across diverse NLP tasks. In this work, we explore a more flexible and dynamic approach to parallel decoding. We propose Learning to Parallel Decode (Learn2PD), a framework that trains a lightweight and adaptive filter model to predict, for each token position, whether the current prediction matches the final output. This learned filter approximates an oracle parallel decoding strategy that unmasks tokens only when correctly predicted. Importantly, the filter model is learned in a post-training manner, requiring only a small amount of computation to optimize it (minute-level GPU time). Additionally, we introduce End-of-Text Prediction (EoTP) to detect decoding completion at the end of sequence, avoiding redundant decoding of padding tokens. Experiments on the LLaDA benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves up to 22.58$\times$ speedup without any performance drop, and up to 57.51$\times$ when combined with KV-Cache.</p></details> |  |

We derive the exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization and show that near criticality the selected minimizer depends sensitively on the initialization. Moreover, we show that adding regularization amplifies this sensitivity, generating a fractal boundary between initializations that converge and those that diverge. The analysis extends to general matrix factorization with orthogonal initialization. Our findings reveal that near-critical step sizes induce a chaotic regime of gradient descent where the long-term dynamics are unpredictable and there are no simple implicit biases, such as towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.</p></details> |  |

However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers, vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) tackle the latter by constraining the model output on a set of predefined and human-interpretable concepts. However, the increased interpretability achieved through these concept-based explanations implies a higher annotation burden. Moreover, if a new concept needs to be added, the whole system needs to be retrained. Inspired by the remarkable performance shown by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in few-shot settings, we propose a simple, yet effective, methodology, CBVLM, which tackles both of the aforementioned challenges. First, for each concept, we prompt the LVLM to answer if the concept is present in the input image. Then, we ask the LVLM to classify the image based on the previous concept predictions. Moreover, in both stages, we incorporate a retrieval module responsible for selecting the best examples for in-context learning. By grounding the final diagnosis on the predicted concepts, we ensure explainability, and by leveraging the few-shot capabilities of LVLMs, we drastically lower the annotation cost. We validate our approach with extensive experiments across four medical datasets and twelve LVLMs (both generic and medical) and show that CBVLM consistently outperforms CBMs and task-specific supervised methods without requiring any training and using just a few annotated examples.

Our attack jailbreaks billion-parameter language models with just 5 to 25 bit-flips, requiring up to 40$\times$ fewer bit flips than prior attacks on much smaller computer vision models. Unlike prompt-based jailbreaks, our method directly uncensors models in memory at runtime, enabling harmful outputs without requiring input-level modifications. Our key innovation is an efficient bit-selection algorithm that identifies critical bits for language model jailbreaks up to 20$\times$ faster than prior methods. We evaluate our attack on 10 open-source LLMs, achieving high attack success rates (ASRs) of 80-98% with minimal impact on model utility. We further demonstrate an end-to-end exploit via Rowhammer-based fault injection, reliably jailbreaking 5 models (69-91% ASR) on a GDDR6 GPU. Our analyses reveal that: (1) models with weaker post-training alignment require fewer bit-flips to jailbreak; (2) certain model components, e.g., value projection layers, are substantially more vulnerable; and (3) the attack is mechanistically different from existing jailbreak methods. We evaluate potential countermeasures and find that our attack remains effective against defenses at various stages of the LLM pipeline.</p></details> | Pre-print |

Bridging the Gap Between Neural Activity and Self-Explanations in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09277v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate plausible free text self-explanations to justify their answers. However, these natural language explanations may not accurately reflect the model's actual reasoning process, indicating a lack of faithfulness. Existing faithfulness evaluation methods rely primarily on behavioral tests or computational block analysis without examining the semantic content of internal neural representations. This paper proposes NeuroFaith, a flexible framework that measures the faithfulness of LLM free text self-explanation by identifying key concepts within explanations and mechanistically testing whether these concepts actually influence the model's predictions. We show the versatility of NeuroFaith across 2-hop reasoning and classification tasks. Additionally, a linear faithfulness probe based on NeuroFaith is developed to detect unfaithful self-explanations from representation space and improve faithfulness through steering. NeuroFaith provides a principled approach to evaluating and enhancing the faithfulness of LLM free text self-explanations, addressing critical needs for trustworthy AI systems.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we propose AudioStory, a unified framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with TTA systems to generate structured, long-form audio narratives. AudioStory possesses strong instruction-following reasoning generation capabilities. It employs LLMs to decompose complex narrative queries into temporally ordered sub-tasks with contextual cues, enabling coherent scene transitions and emotional tone consistency. AudioStory has two appealing features: (1) Decoupled bridging mechanism: AudioStory disentangles LLM-diffuser collaboration into two specialized components, i.e., a bridging query for intra-event semantic alignment and a residual query for cross-event coherence preservation. (2) End-to-end training: By unifying instruction comprehension and audio generation within a single end-to-end framework, AudioStory eliminates the need for modular training pipelines while enhancing synergy between components. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark AudioStory-10K, encompassing diverse domains such as animated soundscapes and natural sound narratives. Extensive experiments show the superiority of AudioStory on both single-audio generation and narrative audio generation, surpassing prior TTA baselines in both instruction-following ability and audio fidelity.

We investigate how to practically use such models to make accurate and efficient character predictions. Our algorithm for producing character predictions from a subword large language model (LLM) provides more accurate predictions than using a classification layer, a byte-level LLM, or an n-gram model. Additionally, we investigate a domain adaptation procedure based on a large dataset of sentences we curated based on scoring how useful each sentence might be for spoken or written AAC communication. We find our procedure further improves model performance on simple, conversational text.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Existing safety techniques -- including external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment -- each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model, and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular, and inference-aware control.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Few Large Shifts: Layer-Inconsistency Based Minimal Overhead Adversarial Example Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12586v5)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly susceptible to adversarial examples--subtle, imperceptible perturbations that can lead to incorrect predictions. While detection-based defenses offer a practical alternative to adversarial training, many existing methods depend on external models, complex architectures, or adversarial data, limiting their efficiency and generalizability. We introduce a lightweight, plug-in detection framework that leverages internal layer-wise inconsistencies within the target model itself, requiring only benign data for calibration. Our approach is grounded in the A Few Large Shifts Assumption, which posits that adversarial perturbations induce large, localized violations of layer-wise Lipschitz continuity in a small subset of layers. Building on this, we propose two complementary strategies--Recovery Testing (RT) and Logit-layer Testing (LT)--to empirically measure these violations and expose internal disruptions caused by adversaries. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet under both standard and adaptive threat models, our method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance with negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, our system-level analysis provides a practical method for selecting a detection threshold with a formal lower-bound guarantee on accuracy.

| **[On Predictability of Reinforcement Learning Dynamics for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00553v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1 Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window, achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 28 figures; 43</p></details> |
| **[TrimTokenator: Towards Adaptive Visual Token Pruning for Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00320v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics, leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference speed.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Large Language Models Inference Engines based on Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00133v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks (SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs, using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1) replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA), (2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a 5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexible Feature Distillation for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10155v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) has become a cornerstone for compressing large language models (LLMs). However, existing LLM-KD methods have primarily focused on logit-based approaches, which achieve good performance but overlook the rich internal representations of LLMs. Feature-level KD could leverage this structure to provide complementary benefits, yet it remains underexplored because current feature-KD approaches typically assume identical teacher-student hidden sizes, a restrictive and unrealistic assumption. A common workaround is to train a linear projector to align their feature spaces; however, this introduces additional parameters, distorts teacher embeddings, and often degrades downstream performance, especially in generative tasks. We propose Flex-KD, a parameter-free framework for task-driven feature distillation for LLMs. Instead of projecting the entire teacher representation, Flex-KD uses gradient-based scores to identify the most task-relevant dimensions of the teacher's hidden states and distills only this subspace into the student. This ensures that the student's limited capacity is allocated to informative components, while avoiding projector-induced distortion and extra parameters. Flex-KD integrates seamlessly with existing KD pipelines and supports differing teacher-student hidden sizes. Extensive experiments across both classification and generative tasks, i.e., instruction-following and summarization, show that Flex-KD consistently boosts student performance, achieving up to a 3.75 percent performance gain over the linear projection baseline.</p></details> |  |

This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design and Application of Multimodal Large Language Model Based System for End to End Automation of Accident Dataset Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00015v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road traffic accidents remain a major public safety and socio-economic issue in developing countries like Bangladesh. Existing accident data collection is largely manual, fragmented, and unreliable, resulting in underreporting and inconsistent records. This research proposes a fully automated system using Large Language Models (LLMs) and web scraping techniques to address these challenges. The pipeline consists of four components: automated web scraping code generation, news collection from online sources, accident news classification with structured data extraction, and duplicate removal. The system uses the multimodal generative LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash for seamless automation. The code generation module classifies webpages into pagination, dynamic, or infinite scrolling categories and generates suitable Python scripts for scraping. LLMs also classify and extract key accident information such as date, time, location, fatalities, injuries, road type, vehicle types, and pedestrian involvement. A deduplication algorithm ensures data integrity by removing duplicate reports. The system scraped 14 major Bangladeshi news sites over 111 days (Oct 1, 2024 - Jan 20, 2025), processing over 15,000 news articles and identifying 705 unique accidents. The code generation module achieved 91.3% calibration and 80% validation accuracy. Chittagong reported the highest number of accidents (80), fatalities (70), and injuries (115), followed by Dhaka, Faridpur, Gazipur, and Cox's Bazar. Peak accident times were morning (8-9 AM), noon (12-1 PM), and evening (6-7 PM). A public repository was also developed with usage instructions. This study demonstrates the viability of an LLM-powered, scalable system for accurate, low-effort accident data collection, providing a foundation for data-driven road safety policymaking in Bangladesh.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted for presentation in TRB annual meeting 2026.

| **[PlaceFM: A Training-free Geospatial Foundation Model of Places using Large-Scale Point of Interest Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02921v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth and continual updates of geospatial data from diverse sources, geospatial foundation model pre-training for urban representation learning has emerged as a key research direction for advancing data-driven urban planning. Spatial structure is fundamental to effective geospatial intelligence systems; however, existing foundation models often lack the flexibility to reason about places, context-rich regions spanning multiple spatial granularities that may consist of many spatially and semantically related points of interest. To address this gap, we propose PlaceFM, a geospatial foundation model that captures place representations through a training-free, clustering-based approach. PlaceFM summarizes the entire point of interest graph constructed from U.S. Foursquare data, producing general-purpose region embeddings while automatically identifying places of interest. These embeddings can be directly integrated into geolocation data pipelines to support a variety of urban downstream tasks. Without the need for costly pre-training, PlaceFM provides a scalable and efficient solution for multi-granular geospatial analysis. Extensive experiments on two real-world prediction tasks, ZIP code-level population density and housing prices, demonstrate that PlaceFM not only outperforms most state-of-the-art graph-based geospatial foundation models but also achieves up to a 100x speedup in generating region-level representations on large-scale POI graphs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/mohammadhashemii/PlaceFM.</p></details> |  |

Although large molecular language models have achieved notable success in task transfer, they often struggle to accurately analyze molecular features due to limited knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address this issue, we present Mol-LLaMA, a large molecular language model that grasps the general knowledge centered on molecules and exhibits explainability and reasoning ability. To this end, we design key data types that encompass the fundamental molecular features, taking into account the essential abilities for molecular reasoning. Further, to improve molecular understanding, we propose a module that integrates complementary information from different molecular encoders, leveraging the distinct advantages of molecular representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mol-LLaMA is capable of comprehending the general features of molecules and providing informative responses, implying its potential as a general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis.

To address this gap, we propose a taxonomy of ontological capabilities and introduce OntoURL, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' capabilities in handling ontologies -- formal and symbolic representations of domain knowledge. Based on the proposed taxonomy, OntoURL systematically assesses three dimensions: understanding, reasoning, and learning through 15 distinct tasks comprising 57,303 questions derived from 40 ontologies across 8 domains. Experiments with 20 open-source LLMs reveal significant performance differences across models, tasks, and domains, with current LLMs showing capabilities in understanding ontological knowledge but weaknesses in reasoning and learning tasks. Further experiments with few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting illustrate how different prompting strategies affect model performance. Additionally, a human evaluation reveals that LLMs outperform humans in understanding and reasoning tasks but fall short in most learning tasks. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in processing symbolic knowledge and establish OntoURL as a critical benchmark for advancing the integration of LLMs with formal knowledge representations.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, their creation demands substantial involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in tasks like ontology engineering, we explore schema generation using LLMs. To bridge the resource gap, we introduce two datasets: YAGO Schema and Wikidata EntitySchema, along with novel evaluation metrics. The LLM-based pipelines utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Experiments demonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas, paving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs. Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured generation, pushing the limits of LLMs on syntactically rich formalisms.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

Recent works mitigates this cost by projecting gradients into low-dimensional subspaces using sophisticated update strategies. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of gradient space and its underlying subspaces. We find that while a small subspace captures most gradient energy, a significant portion still resides in the residual bulk; moreover, the influence of the core subspace diminishes over time and in deeper layers. We also observe that the gradient space exhibits near-flat curvature, calling for algorithms that explicitly account for this geometry. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a suite of randomized algorithms, GrassWalk and GrassJump, which exploit subspace and achieve state-of-the-art memory savings while improving performance on LLaMA-1B and LLaMA-7B pretraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Microscaling Floating Point Formats for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01863v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing computational and memory demands of large language models (LLMs) necessitate innovative approaches to optimize resource usage without compromising performance. This paper leverages microscaling floating-point formats, a novel technique designed to address these challenges by reducing the storage and computational overhead associated with numerical representations in LLMs. Unlike traditional floating-point representations that allocate a dedicated scale for each value, microscaling employs a shared scale across a block of values, enabling compact one-byte floating-point representations while maintaining an extended dynamic range. We explore the application of microscaling in the context of 8-bit floating-point formats to significantly reduce memory footprint and computational costs. We tested several configurations of microscaling floats within the GPT-2 LLM architecture, demonstrating that microscaling data formats can achieve competitive accuracy during training and inference, proving its efficacy as a resource-efficient alternative for deploying LLMs at scale.

The development of advanced control strategies for complex scenarios is hindered, however, by the lack of scalability and robustness of the existing methods, in particular, due to the need of an individual control for each agent. One possible solution involves controlling a system through a leader or a group of leaders, which other agents tend to follow. Using such an approach we develop an effective control strategy for a leader, combining reinforcement learning (RL) with artificial forces acting on the system. To describe the guidance of active particles by a leader we introduce the generalized Vicsek model. This novel method is then applied to the problem of the effective evacuation by a robot-rescuer (leader) of large groups of people from hazardous places. We demonstrate, that while a straightforward application of RL yields suboptimal results, even for advanced architectures, our approach provides a robust and efficient evacuation strategy. The source code supporting this study is publicly available at: https://github.com/cinemere/evacuation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust MPC for Large-scale Linear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01794v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art approaches of Robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) are restricted to linear systems of relatively small scale, i.e., with no more than about 5 states. The main reason is the computational burden of determining a robust positively invariant (RPI) set, whose complexity suffers from the curse of dimensionality. The recently proposed approach of Deadbeat Robust Model Predictive Control (DRMPC) is the first that does not rely on an RPI set. Yet it comes with the full set of essential system theoretic guarantees. DRMPC is hence a viable option, in particular, for large-scale systems. This paper introduces a detailed design procedure for DRMPC. It is shown that the optimal control problem generated for DRMPC has exactly the same computational complexity as Nominal MPC. A numerical study validates its applicability to randomly generated large-scale linear systems of various dimensions.</p></details> |  |

However, scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i) partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2 to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables.

Recently, adopting LLMs in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) has drawn increasing attention. However, the adoption of LLMs faces two major challenges: limited information on graph structure and unreliable responses. LLMs struggle with text attributes isolated from the graph topology. Worse still, they yield unreliable predictions due to both information insufficiency and the inherent weakness of LLMs (e.g., hallucination). Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel method named Dynamic Text Bundling Supervision (DENSE) that queries LLMs with bundles of texts to obtain bundle-level labels and uses these labels to supervise graph neural networks. Specifically, we sample a set of bundles, each containing a set of nodes with corresponding texts of close proximity. We then query LLMs with the bundled texts to obtain the label of each bundle. Subsequently, the bundle labels are used to supervise the optimization of graph neural networks, and the bundles are further refined to exclude noisy items. To justify our design, we also provide theoretical analysis of the proposed method. Extensive experiments across ten datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods, such as the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and recently proposed kernel-based tests for large-scale data, are computationally intensive and/or ineffective for some common alternatives in high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a new test that exhibits high power across a wide range of alternatives. Furthermore, the new test is more robust to high dimensions than existing methods and does not require optimization procedures for choosing kernel bandwidth and other parameters through data splitting. Numerical studies demonstrate that the new approach performs well on both synthetic and real-world data.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, researchers designed gaming agents using Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, or Large Language Models. However, these agents often neglect the diverse strategies employed by human players due to their different personalities, resulting in repetitive solutions in similar situations. Without mimicking varied gaming strategies, these agents struggle to trigger diverse in-game interactions or uncover edge cases. In this paper, we present MIMIC, a novel framework that integrates diverse personality traits into gaming agents, enabling them to adopt different gaming strategies for similar situations. By mimicking different playstyles, MIMIC can achieve higher test coverage and richer in-game interactions across different games. It also outperforms state-of-the-art agents in Minecraft by achieving a higher task completion rate and providing more diverse solutions. These results highlight MIMIC's significant potential for effective game testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables.

This paper introduces an enhanced generative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through five key innovations: multimodal fusion architecture, retrieval-augmented generation mechanisms, causal inference-based debiasing, explainable recommendation generation, and real-time adaptive learning capabilities. Our framework leverages advanced large language models as the backbone while incorporating specialized modules for cross-modal understanding, contextual knowledge integration, bias mitigation, explanation synthesis, and continuous model adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (MovieLens-25M, Amazon-Electronics, Yelp-2023) demonstrate consistent improvements in recommendation accuracy, fairness, and diversity compared to existing approaches. The proposed framework achieves up to 2.3% improvement in NDCG@10 and 1.4% enhancement in diversity metrics while maintaining computational efficiency through optimized inference strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[PychoBench: Evaluating the Psychology Intelligence of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01611v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities, such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S. National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B) remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Collaborative Filtering and Large Language Models with Dynamic Alignment, Multimodal Fusion and Evidence-grounded Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01606v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has explored using Large Language Models for recommendation tasks by transforming user interaction histories and item metadata into text prompts, then having the LLM produce rankings or recommendations. A promising approach involves connecting collaborative filtering knowledge to LLM representations through compact adapter networks, which avoids expensive fine-tuning while preserving the strengths of both components. Yet several challenges persist in practice: collaborative filtering models often use static snapshots that miss rapidly changing user preferences; many real-world items contain rich visual and audio content beyond textual descriptions; and current systems struggle to provide trustworthy explanations backed by concrete evidence. Our work introduces \model{}, a framework that tackles these limitations through three key innovations. We develop an online adaptation mechanism that continuously incorporates new user interactions through lightweight modules, avoiding the need to retrain large models. We create a unified representation that seamlessly combines collaborative signals with visual and audio features, handling cases where some modalities may be unavailable. Finally, we design an explanation system that grounds recommendations in specific collaborative patterns and item attributes, producing natural language rationales users can verify. Our approach maintains the efficiency of frozen base models while adding minimal computational overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Reasoning Meets Compression: Understanding the Effects of LLMs Compression on Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02010v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compression methods, including quantization, distillation, and pruning, improve the computational efficiency of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, existing studies either fail to sufficiently compare all three compression methods on LRMs or lack in-depth interpretation analysis. In this paper, we investigate how the reasoning capabilities of LRMs are compromised during compression, through performance benchmarking and mechanistic interpretation. To uncover the effects of compression on reasoning performance, we benchmark quantized, distilled, and pruned DeepSeek-R1 models on four reasoning datasets (AIME 2024, FOLIO, Temporal Sequences, and MuSiQue). To precisely locate compression effects on model weights, we adapt difference of means and attribution patching techniques, focusing on the activation of every linear component in compressed LRMs, to interpret fine-grained causal relationships between weights and various reasoning capabilities. This fine-grained interpretation addresses a fundamental question of compression: which weights are the most important for reasoning? Overall, we find dynamically quantized 2.51-bit R1 reaches close-to-R1 performance. With empirical verification, we present three main findings that generalize across both Llama and Qwen: (1) Weight count has a greater impact on LRMs' knowledge memorization than reasoning, highlighting the risks of pruning and distillation; (2) The MLP up projection in the final layer of distilled LRMs is one of the most important components, offering a new perspective on locating critical weights - a fundamental problem in model compression; and (3) Current quantization methods overly compress the final-layer modules and MLP gate projections, so protecting just 2% of all weights that are excessively compressed can raise average accuracy by 6.57%, greatly surpassing the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users' questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly available in a Github repository at https://github.com/rgonzalezp/guiding-multimodal-large-language-models-with-blind-and-low-vision-people-visual-questions .</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figure, 2 tables, CV4A11y Workshop at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking and Benchmarking Large Language Models for Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24260v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) for Graph Reasoning have been extensively studied over the past two years, involving enabling LLMs to understand graph structures and reason on graphs to solve various graph problems, with graph algorithm problems being the most prevalent. Recent studies underscore the potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041 test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on the GraphAlgorithm benchmark. This strong baseline encourages further advancements in LLMs for Graph Reasoning in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-Scale Bayesian Causal Discovery with Interventional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01562v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring the causal relationships among a set of variables in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is an important but notoriously challenging problem. Recently, advancements in high-throughput genomic perturbation screens have inspired development of methods that leverage interventional data to improve model identification. However, existing methods still suffer poor performance on large-scale tasks and fail to quantify uncertainty. Here, we propose Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD), an empirical Bayesian framework for causal discovery with interventional data. Our approach models the likelihood of the matrix of total causal effects, which can be approximated by a matrix normal distribution, rather than the full data matrix. We place a spike-and-slab horseshoe prior on the edges and separately learn data-driven weights for scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structures from observational data, treating each edge as a latent variable to enable uncertainty-aware inference. Through extensive simulation, we show that IBCD achieves superior structure recovery compared to existing baselines. We apply IBCD to CRISPR perturbation (Perturb-seq) data on 521 genes, demonstrating that edge posterior inclusion probabilities enable identification of robust graph structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Glaucoma Detection and Structured OCT Report Generation via a Fine-tuned Multimodal Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02403v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: To develop an explainable multimodal large language model (MM-LLM) that (1) screens optic nerve head (ONH) OCT circle scans for quality and (2) generates structured clinical reports that include glaucoma diagnosis and sector-wise retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning assessments. Design: Retrospective cohort study of 1,310 subjects contributing 43,849 Spectralis ONH OCT circle scans (1,331 glaucomatous and 867 healthy eyes) from the DIGS and ADAGES cohorts. Methods: A MM-LLM (Llama 3.2 Vision-Instruct model) was fine-tuned to generate clinical descriptions of OCT imaging data. Training data included paired OCT images and automatically generated, structured clinical reports that described global and sectoral RNFL thinning. Poor-quality scans were labeled as unusable and paired with a fixed refusal statement. The model was evaluated on a held-out test set for three tasks: quality assessment, glaucoma detection, and RNFL thinning classification across seven anatomical sectors. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score. Model description quality was also evaluated using standard text evaluation metrics. Results: The model achieved 0.90 accuracy and 0.98 specificity for quality triage. For glaucoma detection, accuracy was 0.86 (sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.73, F1-score 0.91). RNFL thinning prediction accuracy ranged from 0.83 to 0.94, with highest performance in global and temporal sectors. Text generation scores showed strong alignment with reference reports (BLEU: 0.82; ROUGE-1: 0.94; ROUGE-2: 0.87; ROUGE-L: 0.92; BERTScore-F1: 0.99). Conclusions: The fine-tuned MM-LLM generated accurate clinical descriptions based on OCT imaging. The model achieved high accuracy in identifying image quality issues and detecting glaucoma. The model also provided sectoral descriptions of RNFL thinning to help support clinical OCT evaluation.</p></details> |  |

This matching requires researchers to know the exact wording that other researchers previously used, creating a challenging process that could lead to missing relevant data. Large Language Models (LLMs) could enhance data discovery by removing this requirement and allowing researchers to ask questions with natural language. However, we do not currently know if researchers would accept LLMs for data discovery. Using a human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) focus, we ran focus groups (N = 27) to understand researchers' perspectives towards LLMs for data discovery. Our conceptual model shows that the potential benefits are not enough for researchers to use LLMs instead of current technology. Barriers prevent researchers from fully accepting LLMs, but features around transparency could overcome them. Using our model will allow developers to incorporate features that result in an increased acceptance of LLMs for data discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[OntoLogX: Ontology-Guided Knowledge Graph Extraction from Cybersecurity Logs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01409v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of malicious activity. Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure, semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions. Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset, demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Automating Data-Driven Modeling and Analysis for Engineering Applications using Large Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01398v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable, and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development, training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark, involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of predictive performance.</p></details> |  |

Legato is the first large-scale pretrained OMR model capable of recognizing full-page or multi-page typeset music scores and the first to generate documents in ABC notation, a concise, human-readable format for symbolic music. Bringing together a pretrained vision encoder with an ABC decoder trained on a dataset of more than 214K images, our model exhibits the strong ability to generalize across various typeset scores. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a range of datasets and metrics and demonstrate that Legato outperforms the previous state of the art. On our most realistic dataset, we see a 68\% and 47.6\% absolute error reduction on the standard metrics TEDn and OMR-NED, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, research in this area is often limited by the lack of large, representative, and highquality application datasets that can support empirical studies and the development of new approaches benefiting XR software processes. In this paper, we introduce XRZoo, a comprehensive and curated dataset of XR applications designed to bridge this gap. XRZoo contains 12,528 free XR applications, spanning nine app stores, across all XR techniques (i.e., AR, MR, and VR) and use cases, with detailed metadata on key aspects such as application descriptions, application categories, release dates, user review numbers, and hardware specifications, etc. By making XRZoo publicly available, we aim to foster reproducible XR software engineering and security research, enable cross-disciplinary investigations, and also support the development of advanced XR systems by providing examples to developers. Our dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in improving the scalability, usability, and effectiveness of XR applications. XRZoo will be released and actively maintained.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Illusion of Readiness: Stress Testing Large Frontier Models on Multimodal Medical Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18234v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large frontier models like GPT-5 now achieve top scores on medical benchmarks. But our stress tests tell a different story. Leading systems often guess correctly even when key inputs like images are removed, flip answers under trivial prompt changes, and fabricate convincing yet flawed reasoning. These aren't glitches; they expose how today's benchmarks reward test-taking tricks over medical understanding. We evaluate six flagship models across six widely used benchmarks and find that high leaderboard scores hide brittleness and shortcut learning. Through clinician-guided rubric evaluation, we show that benchmarks vary widely in what they truly measure yet are treated interchangeably, masking failure modes. We caution that medical benchmark scores do not directly reflect real-world readiness. If we want AI to earn trust in healthcare, we must demand more than leaderboard wins and must hold systems accountable for robustness, sound reasoning, and alignment with real medical demands.</p></details> | 35 pages |
| **[CounselBench: A Large-Scale Expert Evaluation and Adversarial Benchmarking of Large Language Models in Mental Health Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08584v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical question answering (QA) benchmarks often focus on multiple-choice or fact-based tasks, leaving open-ended answers to real patient questions underexplored. This gap is particularly critical in mental health, where patient questions often mix symptoms, treatment concerns, and emotional needs, requiring answers that balance clinical caution with contextual sensitivity. We present CounselBench, a large-scale benchmark developed with 100 mental health professionals to evaluate and stress-test large language models (LLMs) in realistic help-seeking scenarios. The first component, CounselBench-EVAL, contains 2,000 expert evaluations of answers from GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Gemini, and human therapists on patient questions from the public forum CounselChat. Each answer is rated across six clinically grounded dimensions, with span-level annotations and written rationales. Expert evaluations show that while LLMs achieve high scores on several dimensions, they also exhibit recurring issues, including unconstructive feedback, overgeneralization, and limited personalization or relevance. Responses were frequently flagged for safety risks, most notably unauthorized medical advice. Follow-up experiments show that LLM judges systematically overrate model responses and overlook safety concerns identified by human experts. To probe failure modes more directly, we construct CounselBench-Adv, an adversarial dataset of 120 expert-authored mental health questions designed to trigger specific model issues. Evaluation of 3,240 responses from nine LLMs reveals consistent, model-specific failure patterns. Together, CounselBench establishes a clinically grounded framework for benchmarking LLMs in mental health QA.</p></details> |  |

Our method calculates a phylogenetic distance metric based on the similarity of LLMs' output. The resulting metric is then used to construct dendrograms, which satisfactorily capture known relationships across a set of 111 open-source and 45 closed models. Furthermore, our phylogenetic distance predicts performance in standard benchmarks, thus demonstrating its functional validity and paving the way for a time and cost-effective estimation of LLM capabilities. To sum up, by translating population genetic concepts to machine learning, we propose and validate a tool to evaluate LLM development, relationships and capabilities, even in the absence of transparent training information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology of Reasoning: Understanding Large Reasoning Models through Reasoning Graph Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05744v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large-scale reasoning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms underlying their success remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce the notion of a reasoning graph, extracted by clustering hidden-state representations at each reasoning step, and systematically analyze three key graph-theoretic properties: cyclicity, diameter, and small-world index, across multiple tasks (GSM8K, MATH500, AIME 2024). Our findings reveal that distilled reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) exhibit significantly more recurrent cycles (about 5 per sample), substantially larger graph diameters, and pronounced small-world characteristics (about 6x) compared to their base counterparts. Notably, these structural advantages grow with task difficulty and model capacity, with cycle detection peaking at the 14B scale and exploration diameter maximized in the 32B variant, correlating positively with accuracy. Furthermore, we show that supervised fine-tuning on an improved dataset systematically expands reasoning graph diameters in tandem with performance gains, offering concrete guidelines for dataset design aimed at boosting reasoning capabilities. By bridging theoretical insights into reasoning graph structures with practical recommendations for data construction, our work advances both the interpretability and the efficacy of large reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Neurips 2025</p></details> |

While numerous benchmarks have emerged to assess LALMs' performance, they remain fragmented and lack a structured taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive survey and propose a systematic taxonomy for LALM evaluations, categorizing them into four dimensions based on their objectives: (1) General Auditory Awareness and Processing, (2) Knowledge and Reasoning, (3) Dialogue-oriented Ability, and (4) Fairness, Safety, and Trustworthiness. We provide detailed overviews within each category and highlight challenges in this field, offering insights into promising future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey specifically focused on the evaluations of LALMs, providing clear guidelines for the community. We will release the collection of the surveyed papers and actively maintain it to support ongoing advancements in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Main).

This gap stems primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT. A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification. Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This framework incorporates a novel Observation \& Reasoning (O\&R) reward mechanism that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks. Project Page: https://rewatch-r1.github.io</p></details> |  |

As a company dedicated to building and operating large-scale GPU training clusters, we encounter several challenges when using NCCL in production, including 1) limited efficiency with costly and cumbersome P2P communication, 2) poor tolerance to frequent RNIC port failures, and 3) insufficient observability of transient collective communication anomalies. To address these issues, we propose ICCL, an efficient, reliable, and observable collective communication library in large-scale GPU training clusters. ICCL offloads the P2P communication from GPU kernels to CPU threads for minimal SM consumption, and removes the redundant memory copies irrelevant to the actual communicating process. ICCL also introduces a primary-backup QP mechanism to tolerate frequent NIC port failures, and designs a window-based monitor to observe network anomalies at O(us) level. We open-source ICCL and deploy it in production training clusters for several months, with results showing that compared to NCCL, ICCL achieves a 23.4%/28.5% improvement in P2P throughput/latency as well as a 6.02% increase in training throughput. We also share the operating experience of ICCL in large-scale clusters, hoping to give the communities more insights on production-level collective communication libraries in LLM training.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Steering When Necessary: Flexible Steering Large Language Models with Backtracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17621v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across many generation tasks. Nevertheless, effectively aligning them with desired behaviors remains a significant challenge. Activation steering is an effective and cost-efficient approach that directly modifies the activations of LLMs during the inference stage, aligning their responses with the desired behaviors and avoiding the high cost of fine-tuning. Existing methods typically indiscriminately intervene to all generations or rely solely on the question to determine intervention, which limits the accurate assessment of the intervention strength. To this end, we propose the Flexible Activation Steering with Backtracking (FASB) framework, which dynamically determines both the necessity and strength of intervention by tracking the internal states of the LLMs during generation, considering both the question and the generated content. Since intervening after detecting a deviation from the desired behavior is often too late, we further propose the backtracking mechanism to correct the deviated tokens and steer the LLMs toward the desired behavior. Extensive experiments on the TruthfulQA dataset and six multiple-choice datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines. Our code will be released at https://github.com/gjw185/FASB.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

We propose RECAP (Robust Safety Alignment via Counter-Aligned Prefilling), a principled reinforcement learning (RL) method for post-training that explicitly teaches models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe and helpful responses. RECAP trains on a mixture of synthetically generated counter-aligned CoT prefills and standard prompts, requires no additional training cost or modifications beyond vanilla reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness, reduces overrefusal, and preserves core reasoning capability -- all while maintaining inference token budget. Extensive analysis shows that RECAP-trained models engage in self-reflection more frequently and remain robust under adaptive attacks, preserving safety even after repeated attempts to override their reasoning.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date, continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected (or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results, which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk measures.</p></details> |  |

Large vision foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77 on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direction for generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, ICOMP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bi-National Academic Funding and Collaboration Dynamics: The Case of the German-Israeli Foundation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02743v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Academic grant programs are widely used to motivate international research collaboration and boost scientific impact across borders. Among these, bi-national funding schemes -- pairing researchers from just two designated countries - are common yet understudied compared with national and multinational funding. In this study, we explore whether bi-national programs genuinely foster new collaborations, high-quality research, and lasting partnerships. To this end, we conducted a bibliometric case study of the German-Israeli Foundation (GIF), covering 642 grants, 2,386 researchers, and 52,847 publications. Our results show that GIF funding catalyzes collaboration during, and even slightly before, the grant period, but rarely produces long-lasting partnerships that persist once the funding concludes. By tracing co-authorship before, during, and after the funding period, clustering collaboration trajectories with temporally-aware K-means, and predicting cluster membership with ML models (best: XGBoost, 74% accuracy), we find that 45% of teams with no prior joint work become active while funded, yet activity declines symmetrically post-award; roughly one-third sustain collaboration longer-term, and a small subset achieve high, lasting output. Moreover, there is no clear pattern in the scientometrics of the team's operating as a predictor for long-term collaboration before the grant. This refines prior assumptions that international funding generally forges enduring networks. The results suggest policy levers such as sequential funding, institutional anchoring (centers, shared infrastructure, mobility), and incentives favoring genuinely new pairings have the potential to convert short-term boosts into resilient scientific bridges and inform the design of bi-national science diplomacy instruments.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces AgenticRAG, a novel framework that combines tool-augmented foundation models with retrieval-augmented generation for zero-shot explainable recommendations. Our approach integrates external tool invocation, knowledge retrieval, and chain-of-thought reasoning to create autonomous recommendation agents capable of transparent decision-making without task-specific training. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AgenticRAG achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with NDCG@10 improvements of 0.4\% on Amazon Electronics, 0.8\% on MovieLens-1M, and 1.6\% on Yelp datasets.

The model supports de novo generation, pharmacophore-conditional sampling, fragment elaboration, and multi-endpoint affinity prediction (pIC50, pKi, pKd, pEC50). Training combines large-scale ligand libraries with mixed-fidelity protein-ligand complexes, followed by refinement on curated co-crystal datasets and parameter-efficient finetuning for project-specific adaptation. Flowr.root achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional 3D molecule generation and pocket-conditional ligand design, producing geometrically realistic, low-strain structures. The integrated affinity prediction module demonstrates superior accuracy on the SPINDR test set and outperforms recent models on the Schrodinger FEP+/OpenFE benchmark with substantial speed advantages. As a foundation model, Flowr.root requires finetuning on project-specific datasets to account for unseen structure-activity landscapes, yielding strong correlation with experimental data. Joint generation and affinity prediction enable inference-time scaling through importance sampling, steering molecular design toward higher-affinity compounds. Case studies validate this: selective CK2alpha ligand generation against CLK3 shows significant correlation between predicted and quantum-mechanical binding energies, while ERalpha and TYK2 scaffold elaboration demonstrates strong agreement with QM calculations. By integrating structure-aware generation, affinity estimation, and property-guided sampling, Flowr.root provides a comprehensive foundation for structure-based drug design spanning hit identification through lead optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Network Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23089v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance. Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs, revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural changes).</p></details> |  |
| **[Inferring Dynamic Physical Properties from Video Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02311v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid, and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficiently Generating Correlated Sample Paths from Multi-step Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02224v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.</p></details> |  |

We propose a detailed, property-by-property mapping of the LRMoo F1 Work to the widely adopted schema.org/Legislation vocabulary. Using Brazilian federal legislation from the Normas.leg.br portal as a practical case study, we demonstrate how to create interoperable, machine-readable descriptions via JSON-LD, focusing on stable URN identifiers, core metadata, and norm relationships. This structured mapping establishes a stable, URI-addressable anchor for each legal norm, creating a verifiable "ground truth". It provides the essential, interoperable foundation upon which subsequent layers of the model, such as temporal versions (Expressions) and internal components, can be built. By bridging formal ontology with web-native standards, this work paves the way for building deterministic and reliable Legal Knowledge Graphs (LKGs), overcoming the limitations of purely probabilistic models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version formalizes the LRMoo event-centric model for the legal lifecycle (enactment, publication).

However, current deep learning models use new principles for unsupervised representation learning that cannot be easily analyzed using classical theories. For example, visual foundation models have found tremendous success using self-supervision or denoising/masked autoencoders, which effectively learn representations from massive amounts of unlabeled data. However, it remains difficult to characterize the representations learned by these models and to explain why they perform well for diverse prediction tasks or show emergent behavior. To answer these questions, one needs to combine mathematical tools from statistics and optimization. This paper provides an overview of recent theoretical advances in representation learning from unlabeled data and mentions our contributions in this direction.</p></details> |  |
| **[PlaceFM: A Training-free Geospatial Foundation Model of Places using Large-Scale Point of Interest Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02921v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth and continual updates of geospatial data from diverse sources, geospatial foundation model pre-training for urban representation learning has emerged as a key research direction for advancing data-driven urban planning. Spatial structure is fundamental to effective geospatial intelligence systems; however, existing foundation models often lack the flexibility to reason about places, context-rich regions spanning multiple spatial granularities that may consist of many spatially and semantically related points of interest. To address this gap, we propose PlaceFM, a geospatial foundation model that captures place representations through a training-free, clustering-based approach. PlaceFM summarizes the entire point of interest graph constructed from U.S. Foursquare data, producing general-purpose region embeddings while automatically identifying places of interest. These embeddings can be directly integrated into geolocation data pipelines to support a variety of urban downstream tasks. Without the need for costly pre-training, PlaceFM provides a scalable and efficient solution for multi-granular geospatial analysis. Extensive experiments on two real-world prediction tasks, ZIP code-level population density and housing prices, demonstrate that PlaceFM not only outperforms most state-of-the-art graph-based geospatial foundation models but also achieves up to a 100x speedup in generating region-level representations on large-scale POI graphs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/mohammadhashemii/PlaceFM.</p></details> |  |

However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures.

| **[Multimodal Foundation Models for Early Disease Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01899v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare generates diverse streams of data, including electronic health records (EHR), medical imaging, genetics, and ongoing monitoring from wearable devices. Traditional diagnostic models frequently analyze these sources in isolation, which constrains their capacity to identify cross-modal correlations essential for early disease diagnosis. Our research presents a multimodal foundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an attention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each modality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head attention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining on many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with little extra work. We provide an experimental strategy that uses benchmark datasets in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, with the goal of testing early detection tasks. The framework includes data governance and model management tools in addition to technological performance to improve transparency, reliability, and clinical interpretability. The suggested method works toward a single foundation model for precision diagnostics, which could improve the accuracy of predictions and help doctors make decisions.</p></details> | 6 pages |

We introduce PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset specifically designed for Olympiad-level physics, enabling systematic study of retrieval-based reasoning. PhoPile includes diagrams, graphs, and equations, capturing the inherently multimodal nature of physics problem solving. Using PhoPile, we benchmark RAG-augmented foundation models, covering both large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) with multiple retrievers.

It has been applied to solve numerous problems across the entire software engineering lifecycle and has demonstrated its versatility in multiple domains. With recent advances in AI, particularly the emergence of foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs), the evolution of SBSE alongside these models remains undetermined. In this window of opportunity, we present a research roadmap that articulates the current landscape of SBSE in relation to FMs, identifies open challenges, and outlines potential research directions to advance SBSE through its integration and interplay with FMs. Specifically, we analyze five core aspects: leveraging FMs for SBSE design, applying FMs to complement SBSE in SE problems, employing SBSE to address FM challenges, adapting SBSE practices for FMs tailored to SE activities, and exploring the synergistic potential between SBSE and FMs. Furthermore, we present a forward-thinking perspective that envisions the future of SBSE in the era of FMs, highlighting promising research opportunities to address challenges in emerging domains.</p></details> |  |

While this is largely true for language and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on. Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results, relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller, dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Recent Advances in Time Series Foundation Models (BERT2S)</p></details> |

However, their robustness to continual adaptation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental stability-plasticity dilemma.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI Foundation Model for Time Series with Innovations Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01560v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces an Artificial Intelligence (AI) foundation model for time series in engineering applications, where causal operations are required for real-time monitoring and control. Since engineering time series are governed by physical, rather than linguistic, laws, large-language-model-based AI foundation models may be ineffective or inefficient. Building on the classical innovations representation theory of Wiener, Kallianpur, and Rosenblatt, we propose Time Series GPT (TS-GPT) -- an innovations-representation-based Generative Pre-trained Transformer for engineering monitoring and control. As an example of foundation model adaptation, we consider Probabilistic Generative Forecasting, which produces future time series samples from conditional probability distributions given past realizations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TS-GPT in forecasting real-time locational marginal prices using historical data from U.S. independent system operators.</p></details> |  |
| **[CarbonX: An Open-Source Tool for Computational Decarbonization Using Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01521v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts, yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable; (ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications. In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model, our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to 21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned, CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flock: A Knowledge Graph Foundation Model via Learning on Random Walks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01510v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs), which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations. Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail, and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement Learning Autonomously using Foundation Models for Multi-Robot Coordination Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14380v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware experiments.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives, aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and adaptation methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/wsl2000/NeuroTTT.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6 challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems. Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data, highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving diverse PDE systems.</p></details> |  |

However, privacy concerns prevent data sharing among multiple data owners, and proprietary restrictions prevent the learning service provider (LSP) from sharing the FM. In this work, we propose BlindFed, a framework enabling collaborative FM adaptation while protecting both parties: data owners do not access the FM or each other's data, and the LSP does not see sensitive task data. BlindFed relies on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and consists of three key innovations: (i) FHE-friendly architectural modifications via polynomial approximations and low-rank adapters, (ii) a two-stage split learning approach combining offline knowledge distillation and online encrypted inference for adapter training without backpropagation through the FM, and (iii) a privacy-boosting scheme using sample permutations and stochastic block sampling to mitigate model extraction attacks. Empirical results on four image classification datasets demonstrate the practical feasibility of the BlindFed framework, albeit at a high communication cost and large computational complexity for the LSP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Previous studies have been limited by small datasets, under-representation of symptomatic non-TB patients, and recordings collected in controlled environments. In this study, we enrolled 512 participants at two hospitals in Zambia, categorised into three groups: bacteriologically confirmed TB (TB+), symptomatic patients with other respiratory diseases (OR), and healthy controls (HC). Usable cough recordings with demographic and clinical data were obtained from 500 participants. Deep learning classifiers based on pre-trained speech foundation models were fine-tuned on cough recordings to predict diagnostic categories. The best-performing model, trained on 3-second audio clips, achieved an AUROC of 85.2% for distinguishing TB coughs from all other participants (TB+/Rest) and 80.1% for TB+ versus symptomatic OR participants (TB+/OR). Incorporating demographic and clinical features improved performance to 92.1% for TB+/Rest and 84.2% for TB+/OR. At a probability threshold of 0.38, the multimodal model reached 90.3% sensitivity and 73.1% specificity for TB+/Rest, meeting WHO target product profile benchmarks for TB screening. Adversarial testing and stratified analyses shows that the model was robust to confounding factors including background noise, recording time, and device variability. These results demonstrate the feasibility of cough-based AI for TB screening in real-world, low-resource settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics</p></details> |

Here, we introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within 1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially enabling real-time pathology AI integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoveGPT: Scaling Mobility Foundation Models with Spatially-Aware Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18670v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of foundation models in language has inspired a new wave of general-purpose models for human mobility. However, existing approaches struggle to scale effectively due to two fundamental limitations: a failure to use meaningful basic units to represent movement, and an inability to capture the vast diversity of patterns found in large-scale data. In this work, we develop MoveGPT, a large-scale foundation model specifically architected to overcome these barriers. MoveGPT is built upon two key innovations: (1) a unified location encoder that maps geographically disjoint locations into a shared semantic space, enabling pre-training on a global scale; and (2) a Spatially-Aware Mixture-of-Experts Transformer that develops specialized experts to efficiently capture diverse mobility patterns. Pre-trained on billion-scale datasets, MoveGPT establishes a new state-of-the-art across a wide range of downstream tasks, achieving performance gains of up to 35% on average. It also demonstrates strong generalization capabilities to unseen cities. Crucially, our work provides empirical evidence of scaling ability in human mobility, validating a clear path toward building increasingly capable foundation models in this domain.</p></details> |  |

Revealing Its Illusory Success and Fragile Foundation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00625v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect knowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for alignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has emerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of parameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other knowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the apparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current literature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of steering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would encourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics. This problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing literature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with robust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured by evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover it, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we find that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation queries. Our empirical evidence shows that editing is likely to be based on shortcuts rather than full semantics, calling for an urgent reconsideration of the very basis of model editing before further advancements can be meaningfully pursued.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a work in progress.

Analyzing physiological signals during sleep is critical in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual diagnoses by clinicians are time-intensive and subjective. Despite advances in deep learning that have enhanced automation, these approaches remain heavily dependent on large-scale labeled datasets. This study introduces SynthSleepNet, a multimodal hybrid self-supervised learning framework designed for analyzing polysomnography (PSG) data. SynthSleepNet effectively integrates masked prediction and contrastive learning to leverage complementary features across multiple modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). This approach enables the model to learn highly expressive representations of PSG data. Furthermore, a temporal context module based on Mamba was developed to efficiently capture contextual information across signals. SynthSleepNet achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream tasks: sleep-stage classification, apnea detection, and hypopnea detection, with accuracies of 89.89%, 99.75%, and 89.60%, respectively. The model demonstrated robust performance in a semi-supervised learning environment with limited labels, achieving accuracies of 87.98%, 99.37%, and 77.52% in the same tasks. These results underscore the potential of the model as a foundational tool for the comprehensive analysis of PSG data. SynthSleepNet demonstrates comprehensively superior performance across multiple downstream tasks compared to other methodologies, making it expected to set a new standard for sleep disorder monitoring and diagnostic systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Assessing Foundation Models for Mold Colony Detection with Limited Training Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00561v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems. Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than traditional models would achieve.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 figures, accepted as oral presentation at GCPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[CardioBench: Do Echocardiography Foundation Models Generalize Beyond the Lab?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00520v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions, high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs. CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional, structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the design of future echocardiography foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black-Box Time-Series Domain Adaptation via Cross-Prompt Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00487v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The black-box domain adaptation (BBDA) topic is developed to address the privacy and security issues where only an application programming interface (API) of the source model is available for domain adaptations. Although the BBDA topic has attracted growing research attentions, existing works mostly target the vision applications and are not directly applicable to the time-series applications possessing unique spatio-temporal characteristics. In addition, none of existing approaches have explored the strength of foundation model for black box time-series domain adaptation (BBTSDA). This paper proposes a concept of Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for the BBTSDA problems. CPFM is constructed under a dual branch network structure where each branch is equipped with a unique prompt to capture different characteristics of data distributions. In the domain adaptation phase, the reconstruction learning phase in the prompt and input levels is developed. All of which are built upon a time-series foundation model to overcome the spatio-temporal dynamic. Our rigorous experiments substantiate the advantage of CPFM achieving improved results with noticeable margins from its competitors in three time-series datasets of different application domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating New AI Cell Foundation Models on Challenging Kidney Pathology Cases Unaddressed by Previous Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01287v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate cell nuclei segmentation is critical for downstream tasks in kidney pathology and remains a major challenge due to the morphological diversity and imaging variability of renal tissues. While our prior work has evaluated early-generation AI cell foundation models in this domain, the effectiveness of recent cell foundation models remains unclear. In this study, we benchmark advanced AI cell foundation models (2025), including CellViT++ variants and Cellpose-SAM, against three widely used cell foundation models developed prior to 2024, using a diverse large-scale set of kidney image patches within a human-in-the-loop rating framework. We further performed fusion-based ensemble evaluation and model agreement analysis to assess the segmentation capabilities of the different models. Our results show that CellViT++ [Virchow] yields the highest standalone performance with 40.3% of predictions rated as "Good" on a curated set of 2,091 challenging samples, outperforming all prior models. In addition, our fused model achieves 62.2% "Good" predictions and only 0.4% "Bad", substantially reducing segmentation errors. Notably, the fusion model (2025) successfully resolved the majority of challenging cases that remained unaddressed in our previous study. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI cell foundation model development in renal pathology and provide a curated dataset of challenging samples to support future kidney-specific model refinement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning-Aware Prompt Orchestration: A Foundation Model for Multi-Agent Language Model Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00326v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large language models has enabled sophisticated multi-agent systems, yet coordinating their reasoning capabilities through prompt engineering remains challenging. We present a theoretically-grounded framework for dynamic prompt orchestration that enhances reasoning across multiple specialized agents. This framework addresses three core challenges: logical consistency preservation during agent transitions, reasoning-aware prompt adaptation, and scalable coordination of distributed inference. Our approach formalizes agent states using prompt templates, reasoning context vectors, and capability matrices. We prove system convergence to stable coordination patterns when step sizes satisfy $\alpha < \frac{1}{2L}$ where $L$ is the Lipschitz constant of the state transition function. We implement this through a distributed architecture that dynamically routes reasoning tasks while maintaining semantic coherence. Experimental results on 1,000 synthetic multi-agent conversations demonstrate a 42% reduction in reasoning latency, a 23% improvement in logical consistency measured by ROUGE-L score, and an 89% success rate for task completion without context loss across agent transitions. Ablation studies identify the consensus mechanism as the primary performance driver, while revealing limitations: performance degrades beyond 10 agent transitions, and the system requires 76.5GB memory for 1,000 concurrent agents. These findings establish a new paradigm for scalable reasoning in multi-agent systems, providing theoretical foundations for understanding reasoning emergence across coordinated language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAP: Two-Stage Adaptive Personalization of Multi-task and Multi-Modal Foundation Models in Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26524v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL), despite demonstrating impressive capabilities in the training of multiple models in a decentralized manner, has been shown to produce a final model not necessarily well-suited to the needs of each client. While extensive work has been conducted on how to create tailored personalized models, called Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), less attention has been given to personalization via fine-tuning of foundation models with multi-task and multi-modal properties. Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting that is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and modalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage Adaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations when it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising personalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server model under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a multitude of baselines. Implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/lee3296/TAP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Developing Generalist Foundation Models from a Multimodal Dataset for 3D Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17834v4)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in medical imaging AI, particularly in 3D imaging, have been limited due to the scarcity of comprehensive datasets. We introduce CT-RATE, a public dataset that pairs 3D medical images with corresponding textual reports. CT-RATE comprises 25,692 non-contrast 3D chest CT scans from 21,304 unique patients. Each scan is accompanied by its corresponding radiology report. Leveraging CT-RATE, we develop CT-CLIP, a CT-focused contrastive language-image pretraining framework designed for broad applications without the need for task-specific training. We demonstrate how CT-CLIP can be used in multi-abnormality detection and case retrieval, and outperforms state-of-the-art fully supervised models across all key metrics. By combining CT-CLIP's vision encoder with a pretrained large language model, we create CT-CHAT, a vision-language foundational chat model for 3D chest CT volumes. Finetuned on over 2.7 million question-answer pairs derived from the CT-RATE dataset, CT-CHAT underscores the necessity for specialized methods in 3D medical imaging. Collectively, the open-source release of CT-RATE, CT-CLIP, and CT-CHAT not only addresses critical challenges in 3D medical imaging but also lays the groundwork for future innovations in medical AI and improved patient care.</p></details> |  |

This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our video-based time series data extraction pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoLink: Empowering Remote Sensing Foundation Model with OpenStreetMap Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26016v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages. Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data integration.

Traditional methods rely on invasive tissue sampling, which may fail to capture a tumor's spatial heterogeneity. While deep learning models have shown promise in molecular profiling, their performance is often limited by scarce annotated data. In contrast, foundation deep learning models offer a more generalizable approach for glioma imaging biomarkers. We propose a Foundation-based Biomarker Network (FoundBioNet) that utilizes a SWIN-UNETR-based architecture to noninvasively predict IDH mutation status from multi-parametric MRI. Two key modules are incorporated: Tumor-Aware Feature Encoding (TAFE) for extracting multi-scale, tumor-focused features, and Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a diverse, multi-center cohort of 1705 glioma patients from six public datasets. Our model achieved AUCs of 90.58%, 88.08%, 65.41%, and 80.31% on independent test sets from EGD, TCGA, Ivy GAP, RHUH, and UPenn, consistently outperforming baseline approaches (p <= 0.05). Ablation studies confirmed that both the TAFE and CMD modules are essential for improving predictive accuracy. By integrating large-scale pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, FoundBioNet enables generalizable glioma characterization. This approach enhances diagnostic accuracy and interpretability, with the potential to enable more personalized patient care.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral and poster presentation at MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Kairos: Towards Adaptive and Generalizable Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25826v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for time series analysis, driven by large-scale pretraining on diverse data corpora. However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity, presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario. Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding. Kairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional encodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus comprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction strategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much fewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the Time-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods across diverse tasks.

However, their widespread adoption raises critical concerns regarding trustworthiness across dimensions. This paper presents a comprehensive framework to address these challenges through three key contributions. First, we systematically review global AI governance laws and policies from governments and regulatory bodies, as well as industry practices and standards. Based on this analysis, we propose a set of guiding principles for GenFMs, developed through extensive multidisciplinary collaboration that integrates technical, ethical, legal, and societal perspectives. Second, we introduce TrustGen, the first dynamic benchmarking platform designed to evaluate trustworthiness across multiple dimensions and model types, including text-to-image, large language, and vision-language models. TrustGen leverages modular components--metadata curation, test case generation, and contextual variation--to enable adaptive and iterative assessments, overcoming the limitations of static evaluation methods. Using TrustGen, we reveal significant progress in trustworthiness while identifying persistent challenges. Finally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the challenges and future directions for trustworthy GenFMs, which reveals the complex, evolving nature of trustworthiness, highlighting the nuanced trade-offs between utility and trustworthiness, and consideration for various downstream applications, identifying persistent challenges and providing a strategic roadmap for future research. This work establishes a holistic framework for advancing trustworthiness in GenAI, paving the way for safer and more responsible integration of GenFMs into critical applications. To facilitate advancement in the community, we release the toolkit for dynamic evaluation.</p></details> |  |

As vision foundation models (VFMs) increasingly serve as the backbone of vision applications, it remains unclear how SSL interacts with these pre-trained models. To address this gap, we develop new SSL benchmark datasets where frozen VFMs underperform and systematically evaluate representative SSL methods. We make a surprising observation: parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using only labeled data often matches SSL performance, even without leveraging unlabeled data. This motivates us to revisit self-training, a conceptually simple SSL baseline, where we use the supervised PEFT model to pseudo-label unlabeled data for further training. To overcome the notorious issue of noisy pseudo-labels, we propose ensembling multiple PEFT approaches and VFM backbones to produce more robust pseudo-labels. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful approach, providing actionable insights into SSL with VFMs and paving the way for more scalable and practical semi-supervised learning in the era of foundation models.</p></details> |  |

| **[Can Molecular Foundation Models Know What They Don't Know? A Simple Remedy with Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25509v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular foundation models are rapidly advancing scientific discovery, but their unreliability on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples severely limits their application in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery and protein design. A critical failure mode is chemical hallucination, where models make high-confidence yet entirely incorrect predictions for unknown molecules. To address this challenge, we introduce Molecular Preference-Aligned Instance Ranking (Mole-PAIR), a simple, plug-and-play module that can be flexibly integrated with existing foundation models to improve their reliability on OOD data through cost-effective post-training. Specifically, our method formulates the OOD detection problem as a preference optimization over the estimated OOD affinity between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, achieving this goal through a pairwise learning objective. We show that this objective essentially optimizes AUROC, which measures how consistently ID and OOD samples are ranked by the model. Extensive experiments across five real-world molecular datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the OOD detection capabilities of existing molecular foundation models, achieving up to 45.8%, 43.9%, and 24.3% improvements in AUROC under distribution shifts of size, scaffold, and assay, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Unlike training a variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of 1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://aligntok.github.io/</p></details> |

Successfully executing these tasks often requires orchestrating calls to FMs alongside other software components. However, manually decomposing a task into a coherent sequence of smaller, logically aggregated steps, commonly referred to as workflows, demands considerable effort and specialized domain knowledge. While FMs can assist in generating such workflows specified in domain-specific languages (DSLs), achieving accuracy and reliability in this process remains a challenge. This work introduces a framework that leverages static analysis feedback to enable FMs to detect and repair defects in the DSL-based workflows they generate. We begin by presenting the first-ever taxonomy of incidences of defects in FM-generated DSL workflows, categorizing them into 18 distinct types. Furthermore, we observe a high prevalence of defects across FM-generated DSL workflows, with 87.27% of the studied instances containing at least one defect. This, in turn, emphasizes the magnitude of the problem in practice and underscores the necessity for implementing mitigation strategies. Following this, we demonstrate that nine types of these defects can be effectively identified through static analysis of the workflows. For this purpose, we develop Timon, the first-of-its-kind static analyzer specifically designed for FM-generated DSL workflows. Finally, we show that by incorporating feedback from Timon, we can guide Pumbaa, an FM-based tool, to repair the detected defect incidences. By systematically detecting and repairing defects, our work provides a crucial step towards the reliable and automated generation of executable workflows from natural language requirements.</p></details> |  |

Yet machine learning for ECG interpretation remains fragmented, often limited to narrow tasks or datasets. Foundation models promise broader adaptability, but their generalization across diverse ECG tasks is not well understood. We benchmarked eight ECG foundation models on 26 clinically relevant tasks using 12 public datasets comprising 1,650 regression and classification targets. Models were evaluated under fine-tuning and frozen settings, with scaling analyses across dataset sizes. Results show heterogeneous performance across domains: in the most widely studied domain, adult ECG interpretation, three foundation models consistently outperformed strong supervised baselines. In contrast, ECG-CPC, a compact structured state-space model pretrained on HEEDB, dominated other categories where most foundation models failed to surpass supervised learning. Foundation models also displayed distinct scaling behaviors with dataset size, which are critical for small-scale clinical applications. Overall, while foundation models show promise for adult ECG analysis, substantial gaps remain in cardiac structure, outcome prediction, and patient characterization. Notably, ECG-CPC's strong performance despite being orders of magnitude smaller and consuming minimal computational resources highlights untapped opportunities for advancing ECG foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 3 figures source code under https://github.com/AI4HealthUOL/ecg-fm-benchmarking</p></details> |

However, developing AI models often requires extensive annotation, and existing models tend to underperform on independent, unseen data. Foundation models (FMs), large AI models trained on vast unlabeled datasets, have shown promise in overcoming these challenges. Nonetheless, available FMs for ophthalmology lack extensive validation, especially for segmentation tasks, and focus on a single imaging modality. In this context, we propose MIRAGE, a novel multimodal FM for the analysis of OCT and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) images. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation benchmark with OCT/SLO classification and segmentation tasks. The comparison with general and specialized FMs and segmentation methods shows the superiority of MIRAGE in both types of tasks, highlighting its suitability as a basis for the development of robust AI systems for retinal OCT image analysis.

While recent domain adaptation studies have introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and the dual supervisions during iterative adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAM consistently outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.</p></details> | 5 pages |

Current neural network approaches to MTPP inference rely on training separate, specialized models for each target system. We pursue a radically different approach: drawing on amortized inference and in-context learning, we pretrain a deep neural network to infer, in-context, the conditional intensity functions of event histories from a context defined by sets of event sequences. Pretraining is performed on a large synthetic dataset of MTPPs sampled from a broad distribution of Hawkes processes. Once pretrained, our Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) can estimate MTPPs from real-world data without any additional training, or be rapidly finetuned to target systems. Experiments show that this amortized approach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction across common benchmark datasets. Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials will soon be available online</p></details> |  |

Despite their success in general domains, applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1) the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks; and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs' learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Foundation Models for Causal Inference via Prior-Data Fitted Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10914v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper, we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including for back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train models to perform in-context learning in these settings. We show that CausalFM achieves competitive in-context learning performance even when compared to baselines that are specifically trained for the task at hand. In sum, our framework can be used as a general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference, CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other disciplines.</p></details> |  |

We introduce GIT-BO, a Gradient-Informed BO framework that couples TabPFN v2, a tabular foundation model that performs zero-shot Bayesian inference in context, with an active-subspace mechanism computed from the model's own predictive-mean gradients. This aligns exploration to an intrinsic low-dimensional subspace via a Fisher-information estimate and selects queries with a UCB acquisition, requiring no online retraining. Across 60 problem variants spanning 20 benchmarks-nine scalable synthetic families and ten real-world tasks (e.g., power systems, Rover, MOPTA08, Mazda)-up to 500 dimensions, GIT-BO delivers a stronger performance-time trade-off than state-of-the-art GP-based methods (SAASBO, TuRBO, Vanilla BO, BAxUS), ranking highest in performance and with runtime advantages that grow with dimensionality. Limitations include memory footprint and dependence on the capacity of the underlying TFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Establishing a Foundation for Tetun Ad-Hoc Text Retrieval: Stemming, Indexing, Retrieval, and Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11758v5)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Searching for information on the internet and digital platforms requires effective retrieval solutions. However, such solutions are not yet available for Tetun, making it difficult to find relevant documents for search queries in this language. To address this gap, we investigate Tetun text retrieval with a focus on the ad-hoc retrieval task. The study begins with the development of essential language resources -- including a list of stopwords, a stemmer, and a test collection -- that serve as a foundation for Tetun text retrieval. Various strategies are evaluated using document titles and content. The results show that retrieving document titles, after removing hyphens and apostrophes but without applying stemming, improves performance compared to the baseline. Efficiency increases by 31.37\%, while effectiveness achieves an average relative gains of +9.40\% in MAP@10 and +30.35\% in NDCG@10 with DFR BM25. Beyond the top-10 cutoff point, Hiemstra LM demonstrates strong performance across multiple retrieval strategies and evaluation metrics. The contributions of this work include the development of \textit{Labadain-Stopwords} (a list of 160 Tetun stopwords), \textit{Labadain-Stemmer} (a Tetun stemmer with three variants), and \textit{Labadain-Avaliad\'or} (a Tetun test collection comprising 59 topics, 33,550 documents, and 5,900 \textit{qrels}). These resources are publicly available to support future research in Tetun information retrieval.</p></details> | Version 4 |

Despite its potential, data preparation, pre-training strategy development, and architectural design present significant challenges in constructing this model. Therefore, we introduce UniTraj, a Universal Trajectory foundation model that aims to address these limitations through three key innovations. First, we construct WorldTrace, an unprecedented dataset of 2.45 million trajectories with billions of GPS points spanning 70 countries, providing the diverse geographic coverage essential for region-independent modeling. Second, we develop novel pre-training strategies--Adaptive Trajectory Resampling and Self-supervised Trajectory Masking--that enable robust learning from heterogeneous trajectory data with varying sampling rates and quality. Finally, we tailor a flexible model architecture to accommodate a variety of trajectory tasks, effectively capturing complex movement patterns to support broad applicability. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior scalability, adaptability, and generalization, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal yet non-exclusive training resource.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a research paper by NeurIPS'25</p></details> |
| **[Specialization after Generalization: Towards Understanding Test-Time Training in Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24510v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent empirical studies have explored the idea of continuing to train a model at test-time for a given task, known as test-time training (TTT), and have found it to yield significant performance improvements. However, there is limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task. Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most effective.</p></details> |  |
| **[DART: Differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer for Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10390v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The content-agnostic, fixed-grid tokenizers used by standard large-scale vision models like Vision Transformer (ViT) and Vision Mamba (Vim) represent a fundamental performance bottleneck, creating a trade-off between capturing fine-grained detail and suffering from redundant computation. To resolve this dilemma, we introduce DART, a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer. DART employs learnable region scores and quantile-based partitioning to create content-aware patches of varying sizes, intelligently allocating a higher token density to information-rich regions. The impact of this approach is profound: it unlocks a more intelligent scaling paradigm, where a DART-equipped DeiT-Small (22M parameters) matches the performance of a DeiT-Base (86M) with nearly double the inference speed by efficiently capturing high-resolution details in key regions. Furthermore, the principle of adaptive tokenization proves its generality with clear benefits in dense prediction and spatiotemporal video tasks. We argue that by resolving the tokenizer bottleneck at its source, adaptive tokenization is a key component for building the next generation of more efficient and capable foundation models for multimodal AI, robotics, and content generation.

However, existing methods, whether based on handcrafted feature engineering or standard deep learning, face two major challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale EEG-AD datasets for robust representation learning, and 2) the absence of a dedicated deep learning pipeline for subject-level detection, which is more clinically meaningful than the commonly used sample-level detection. To address these gaps, we have curated the world's largest EEG-AD corpus to date, comprising 2,255 subjects. Leveraging this unique data corpus, we propose LEAD, the first large-scale foundation model for EEG analysis in dementia. Our approach provides an innovative framework for subject-level AD detection, including: 1) a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline such as artifact removal, resampling, and filtering, and a newly proposed multi-scale segmentation strategy, 2) a subject-regularized spatio-temporal transformer trained with a novel subject-level cross-entropy loss and an indices group-shuffling algorithm, and 3) AD-guided contrastive pre-training. We pre-train on 12 datasets (3 AD-related and 9 non-AD) and fine-tune/test on 4 AD datasets. Compared with 10 baselines, LEAD consistently obtains superior subject-level detection performance under the challenging subject-independent cross-validation protocol. On the benchmark ADFTD dataset, our model achieves an impressive subject-level Sensitivity of 90.91% under the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) setting. These results strongly validate the effectiveness of our method for real-world EEG-based AD detection. Source code: https://github.com/DL4mHealth/LEAD</p></details> |  |
| **[DINOReg: Strong Point Cloud Registration with Vision Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24370v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7% increase in registration recall. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ccjccjccj/DINOReg.</p></details> |  |

However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations, severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over 904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24 synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets, advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.</p></details> |  |
| **[G-reasoner: Foundation Models for Unified Reasoning over Graph-structured Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24276v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG (GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency and cross-graph generalization.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Graph Foundation Models: Bridging Language Model Paradigms and Graph Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24256v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pretrain-transfer paradigm, which underpins the success of large language models (LLMs), has demonstrated the immense power of creating foundation models that learn generalizable representations from vast datasets. However, extending this paradigm to Operations Research (OR) problems on graph structures remains challenging due to the fundamental conflict between the statistical flexibility of language and the strict combinatorial constraints of graphs. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for applying foundation model innovations to OR.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we present EVLF-FM, a multimodal vision-language foundation model (VLM) designed to unify broad diagnostic capability with fine-grain explainability. The development and testing of EVLF-FM encompassed over 1.3 million total samples from 23 global datasets across eleven imaging modalities related to six clinical specialties: dermatology, hepatology, ophthalmology, pathology, pulmonology, and radiology. External validation employed 8,884 independent test samples from 10 additional datasets across five imaging modalities. Technically, EVLF-FM is developed to assist with multiple disease diagnosis and visual question answering with pixel-level visual grounding and reasoning capabilities. In internal validation for disease diagnostics, EVLF-FM achieved the highest average accuracy (0.858) and F1-score (0.797), outperforming leading generalist and specialist models. In medical visual grounding, EVLF-FM also achieved stellar performance across nine modalities with average mIOU of 0.743 and Acc@0.5 of 0.837. External validations further confirmed strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, with competitive F1-scores despite a smaller model size. Through a hybrid training strategy combining supervised and visual reinforcement fine-tuning, EVLF-FM not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also exhibits step-by-step reasoning, aligning outputs with visual evidence. EVLF-FM is an early multi-disease VLM model with explainability and reasoning capabilities that could advance adoption of and trust in foundation models for real-world clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uni-NTFM: A Unified Foundation Model for EEG Signal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24222v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on various and unlabeled data have demonstrated significant success in natural language and vision, but their application to electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenged due to the signal's unique properties. Existing brain foundation models that inherit architectures designed for text or images lead to three limitations in pre-training: 1) conflating time-domain waveform patterns with frequency-domain rhythmic features in a single processing stream, 2) ignoring the critical spatial topology of electrodes with different standards, and 3) reliance on the inflexible, dense network to process functionally distinct EEG patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce the Unified Neural Topological Foundation Model (Uni-NTFM), which is designed based on neuroscience principles to produce universal and interpretable representations. Uni-NTFM integrates three core innovations: 1) a decoupled architecture parallelly encodes time, frequency, and raw signal representations before performing cross-domain feature integration; 2) a topological embedding mechanism to unify electrodes from different international standards and generate structured input sequences for brain regions; and 3) a Mixture-of-Experts neural Transformer that efficiently scales model capacity by routing signal patterns to specialized subnetworks. The largest model, Uni-NTFM$_{large}$, has a record-breaking 1.9B parameters and was pretrained on over 28,000 hours of diverse EEG data via a dual-domain masked reconstruction objective. Uni-NTFM significantly outperforms existing task-specific methods and foundation models across nine distinct downstream tasks under both linear probing and fine-tuning settings, demonstrating a superior ability to learn universal representations of brain activity.</p></details> |  |

FoG is characterized by sudden episodes where walking cannot start or is interrupted, occurring exclusively during standing or walking, and never while sitting or lying down. Current FoG detection systems require extensive patient-specific training data and lack generalization, limiting clinical deployment. To address these issues, we introduce FM-FoG, a real-time foundation model-based wearable system achieving FoG detection in unseen patients without patient-specific training. Our approach combines self-supervised pretraining on diverse Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) datasets with sensor context integration. Since FoG occurs only during ambulatory activities, a lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier selectively activates the foundation model only during walking or standing, avoiding unnecessary computation. Evaluated on the VCU FoG-IMU dataset with 23 PD patients, FM-FoG achieves a 98.5% F1-score when tested on previously unseen patients, substantially outperforming competitive baseline methods. Deployed on a Google Pixel 8a smartphone, the system extends battery life by up to 72% while maintaining sub-20ms intervention latency. The results indicate that our FM-FoG can enable practical, energy-efficient healthcare applications that generalize across patients without individual training requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint version, 12 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, existing game benchmarks fall short of practical needs: they lack evaluations of diverse LLM capabilities across various game genres, studies of agentic modules crucial for complex gameplay, and fine-tuning datasets for aligning pre-trained LLMs into gaming agents. To fill these gaps, we present Orak, a foundational benchmark designed to train and evaluate LLM agents across diverse real-world video games. Unlike existing benchmarks, Orak includes 12 popular video games spanning all major genres, enabling comprehensive studies of LLM capabilities and agentic modules essential for intricate game scenarios. To support consistent evaluation of LLMs, we introduce a plug-and-play interface based on Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables LLMs to seamlessly connect with games and manipulate agentic modules. Additionally, we propose a fine-tuning dataset, consisting of LLM gameplay trajectories across diverse game genres. Orak offers a comprehensive evaluation framework, encompassing general game score leaderboards, LLM battle arenas, and in-depth analyses of visual input state, agentic strategies, and fine-tuning effects, establishing a foundation towards building generic gaming agents.

It is commonly the first-line imaging in neurologic emergencies given its rapidity of image acquisition, safety, cost, and ubiquity. Deep learning models may facilitate detection of a wide range of diseases. However, the scarcity of high-quality labels and annotations, particularly among less common conditions, significantly hinders the development of powerful models. To address this challenge, we introduce FM-CT: a Foundation Model for Head CT for generalizable disease detection, trained using self-supervised learning. Our approach pre-trains a deep learning model on a large, diverse dataset of 361,663 non-contrast 3D head CT scans without the need for manual annotations, enabling the model to learn robust, generalizable features. To investigate the potential of self-supervised learning in head CT, we employed both discrimination with self-distillation and masked image modeling, and we construct our model in 3D rather than at the slice level (2D) to exploit the structure of head CT scans more comprehensively and efficiently. The model's downstream classification performance is evaluated using internal and three external datasets, encompassing both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our results demonstrate that the self-supervised foundation model significantly improves performance on downstream diagnostic tasks compared to models trained from scratch and previous 3D CT foundation models on scarce annotated datasets. This work highlights the effectiveness of self-supervised learning in medical imaging and sets a new benchmark for head CT image analysis in 3D, enabling broader use of artificial intelligence for head CT-based diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review Preprint</p></details> |

However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360 images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion 0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in deep learning and foundation models have led to substantial improvements in general time series forecasting, most existing approaches fail to capture the complex spatial interdependencies and uncertainty inherent in electricity markets. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset across 24 European countries (38 regions), spanning from 2022-01-01 to 2025-01-01. Building on this groundwork, we propose PriceFM, a spatiotemporal foundation model that integrates graph-based inductive biases to capture spatial interdependencies across interconnected electricity markets. The model is designed for multi-region, multi-timestep, and multi-quantile probabilistic electricity price forecasting. Extensive experiments and ablation studies confirm the model's effectiveness, consistently outperforming competitive baselines and highlighting the importance of spatial context in electricity markets.

Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows. This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture, enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD} significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT), providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships. (3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11 representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE) by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%. Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems, which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.</p></details> | 31 pages, 22 figures |

With the growing number of TSFMs, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a transferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an in-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it predicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target) dataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as contextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time scenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset meta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ tabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce a novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers, capturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize across arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for transferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3 forecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong alignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets, achieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement compared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.</p></details> |  |

While unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge for single tasks, existing multi-task UDA methods primarily rely on adversarial learning approaches that are less effective than recent self-training techniques. In this paper, we introduce FAMDA, a simple yet effective UDA framework that bridges this gap by leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as powerful teachers. Our approach integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for the target domain, effectively distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a single, efficient student network. Extensive experiments show that FAMDA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard synthetic-to-real UDA multi-task learning (MTL) benchmarks and a challenging new day-to-night adaptation task. Our framework enables the training of highly efficient models; a lightweight variant achieves SOTA accuracy while being more than 10$\times$ smaller than foundation models, highlighting FAMDA's suitability for creating domain-adaptive and efficient models for resource-constrained robotics applications.</p></details> |  |

Traditional impact models, whether process-based, statistical, or machine learning, struggle with spatial generalization due to limited observations and concept drift. Recently proposed vision foundation models trained on satellite imagery demand massive compute and are ill-suited for dynamic land-surface prediction. We introduce StefaLand, a generative spatiotemporal earth foundation model centered on landscape interactions. StefaLand improves predictions on four tasks and five datasets: streamflow, soil moisture, and soil composition, compared to prior state-of-the-art. Results highlight its ability to generalize across diverse, data-scarce regions and support broad land-surface applications. The model builds on a masked autoencoder backbone that learns deep joint representations of landscape attributes, with a location-aware architecture fusing static and time-series inputs, attribute-based representations that drastically reduce compute, and residual fine-tuning adapters that enhance transfer. While inspired by prior methods, their alignment with geoscience and integration in one model enables robust performance on dynamic land-surface tasks. StefaLand can be pretrained and finetuned on academic compute yet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and even fine-tuned vision foundation models. To our knowledge, this is the first geoscience land-surface foundation model that demonstrably improves dynamic land-surface interaction predictions and supports diverse downstream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Decoding for Robotics Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01728v3)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. Trained on vast datasets of simulated and real-world trajectories, these models map multimodal observations directly to action sequences for physical execution. Despite promising real-world capabilities, these models are still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral correctness. We address this gap by introducing SafeDec, a constrained decoding framework for autoregressive, robot foundation models that enforces invariant safety specifications on candidate action trajectories. Task-specific safety rules are expressed as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulas and are enforced at inference time with minimal overhead. Our method ensures that generated actions provably satisfy STL specifications under assumed dynamics at runtime without retraining , while remaining agnostic of the underlying policy. We evaluate SafeDec on tasks from the CHORES benchmark for state-of-the-art generalist policies (e.g., SPOC, Flare, PoliFormer) across hundreds of procedurally generated environments and show that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe actions but also for conditional action generation.

Yet, while self-supervised speech representation learning from raw waveforms has been remarkably successful, these approaches have not achieved similar feats for general-purpose audio representation learning from waveforms. Here, we propose WavJEPA, a waveform-based version of the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture. WavJEPA leverages high-level semantic representation learning to tackle the shortcomings of representation learning at the speech unit or token level. We show that this approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art time-domain audio foundation models across a wide variety of downstream benchmark tasks, while requiring considerably fewer computational resources. Additionally, to overcome the performance drop that time-domain models typically exhibit in noisy and reverberant real-world acoustic environments, we present WavJEPA-Nat. WavJEPA-Nat is a multi-channel extension of the WavJEPA architecture trained on simulated naturalistic scenes. We find that WavJEPA-Nat is highly robust to reverberation and noise. These results highlight the feasibility and computational efficiency of general-purpose audio representation learning from raw waveforms, showcasing the potential for low-latency, robust time-domain audio foundation models for real-world applications.</p></details> | Still under review |
| **[ControlEvents: Controllable Synthesis of Event Camera Datawith Foundational Prior from Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22864v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, event cameras have gained significant attention due to their bio-inspired properties, such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. However, obtaining large-scale labeled ground-truth data for event-based vision tasks remains challenging and costly. In this paper, we present ControlEvents, a diffusion-based generative model designed to synthesize high-quality event data guided by diverse control signals such as class text labels, 2D skeletons, and 3D body poses. Our key insight is to leverage the diffusion prior from foundation models, such as Stable Diffusion, enabling high-quality event data generation with minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled data. Our method streamlines the data generation process and significantly reduces the cost of producing labeled event datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by synthesizing event data for visual recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation. Our experiments show that the synthesized labeled event data enhances model performance in all tasks. Additionally, our approach can generate events based on unseen text labels during training, illustrating the powerful text-based generation capabilities inherited from foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoveFM-R: Advancing Mobility Foundation Models via Language-driven Semantic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22403v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobility Foundation Models (MFMs) have advanced the modeling of human movement patterns, yet they face a ceiling due to limitations in data scale and semantic understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful semantic reasoning, they lack the innate understanding of spatio-temporal statistics required for generating physically plausible mobility trajectories. To address these gaps, we propose MoveFM-R, a novel framework that unlocks the full potential of mobility foundation models by leveraging language-driven semantic reasoning capabilities. It tackles two key challenges: the vocabulary mismatch between continuous geographic coordinates and discrete language tokens, and the representation gap between the latent vectors of MFMs and the semantic world of LLMs. MoveFM-R is built on three core innovations: a semantically enhanced location encoding to bridge the geography-language gap, a progressive curriculum to align the LLM's reasoning with mobility patterns, and an interactive self-reflection mechanism for conditional trajectory generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoveFM-R significantly outperforms existing MFM-based and LLM-based baselines. It also shows robust generalization in zero-shot settings and excels at generating realistic trajectories from natural language instructions. By synthesizing the statistical power of MFMs with the deep semantic understanding of LLMs, MoveFM-R pioneers a new paradigm that enables a more comprehensive, interpretable, and powerful modeling of human mobility. The implementation of MoveFM-R is available online at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoveFM-R-CDE7/.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCAM: A Real-World Typographic Robustness Evaluation for Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04893v6)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typographic attacks exploit the interplay between text and visual content in multimodal foundation models, causing misclassifications when misleading text is embedded within images. Existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings indicate that typographic attacks remain effective against state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models, especially those employing vision encoders inherently vulnerable to such attacks. However, employing larger Large Language Model backbones reduces this vulnerability while simultaneously enhancing typographic understanding. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems. Finally, we publicly release the datasets introduced in this paper, along with the code for evaluations under www.bliss.berlin/research/scam.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 Workshop EVAL-FoMo-2</p></details> |
| **[Intercept Cancer: Cancer Pre-Screening with Large Scale Healthcare Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00209v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately, existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieves strong efficacy, with 50% sensitivity in predicting first cancer risks at 99% specificity cutoff, and outperforming feature-based tree models and both general and medical LLMs by up to 20% AUPRC. Despite significant demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Adaptive Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Weather Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22020v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advances in machine learning have equipped Weather Foundation Models (WFMs) with substantial generalization capabilities across diverse downstream tasks, the escalating computational requirements associated with their expanding scale increasingly hinder practical deployment. Current Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, designed for vision or language tasks, fail to address the unique challenges of weather downstream tasks, such as variable heterogeneity, resolution diversity, and spatiotemporal coverage variations, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to WFMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce WeatherPEFT, a novel PEFT framework for WFMs incorporating two synergistic innovations. First, during the forward pass, Task-Adaptive Dynamic Prompting (TADP) dynamically injects the embedding weights within the encoder to the input tokens of the pre-trained backbone via internal and external pattern extraction, enabling context-aware feature recalibration for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, during backpropagation, Stochastic Fisher-Guided Adaptive Selection (SFAS) not only leverages Fisher information to identify and update the most task-critical parameters, thereby preserving invariant pre-trained knowledge, but also introduces randomness to stabilize the selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of WeatherPEFT on three downstream tasks, where existing PEFT methods show significant gaps versus Full-Tuning, and WeatherPEFT achieves performance parity with Full-Tuning using fewer trainable parameters. The code of this work will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reasoning in Foundation Models: Benchmarking Object-Centric Spatial Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21922v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models. While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs) have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models. Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL, LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, NeurIPS Workshop SpaVLE</p></details> |
| **[Towards a Physics Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13805v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing through a ``train once, deploy anywhere'' paradigm, where a single pre-trained model adapts to countless downstream tasks without retraining. Access to a Physics Foundation Model (PFM) would be transformative -- democratizing access to high-fidelity simulations, accelerating scientific discovery, and eliminating the need for specialized solver development. Yet current physics-aware machine learning approaches remain fundamentally limited to single, narrow domains and require retraining for each new system. We present the General Physics Transformer (GPhyT), trained on 1.8 TB of diverse simulation data, that demonstrates foundation model capabilities are achievable for physics. Our key insight is that transformers can learn to infer governing dynamics from context, enabling a single model to simulate fluid-solid interactions, shock waves, thermal convection, and multi-phase dynamics without being told the underlying equations. GPhyT achieves three critical breakthroughs: (1) superior performance across multiple physics domains, outperforming specialized architectures by up to 29x, (2) zero-shot generalization to entirely unseen physical systems through in-context learning, and (3) stable long-term predictions through 50-timestep rollouts. By establishing that a single model can learn generalizable physical principles from data alone, this work opens the path toward a universal PFM that could transform computational science and engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[QoNext: Towards Next-generation QoE for Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21889v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing evaluations of foundation models, including recent human-centric approaches, fail to capture what truly matters: user's experience during interaction. Current methods treat evaluation as a matter of output correctness alone, overlooking that user satisfaction emerges from the interplay between response quality and interaction, which limits their ability to account for the mechanisms underlying user experience. To address this gap, we introduce QoNext, the first framework that adapts Quality of Experience (QoE) principles from networking and multimedia to the assessment of foundation models. QoNext identifies experiential factors that shape user experience and incorporates them into controlled experiments, where human ratings are collected under varied configurations. From these studies we construct a QoE-oriented database and train predictive models that estimate perceived user experience from measurable system parameters. Our results demonstrate that QoNext not only enables proactive and fine-grained evaluation but also provides actionable guidance for productized services of optimizing foundation models in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolSpectLLM: A Molecular Foundation Model Bridging Spectroscopy, Molecule Elucidation, and 3D Structure Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21861v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction. Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks. MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task, obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular elucidation, and molecular design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expanding Reasoning Potential in Foundation Model by Learning Diverse Chains of Thought Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21124v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only 10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of downstream RL performance by 7.81%.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChaosNexus: A Foundation Model for Universal Chaotic System Forecasting with Multi-scale Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21802v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately forecasting chaotic systems, prevalent in domains such as weather prediction and fluid dynamics, remains a significant scientific challenge. The inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system, they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications, which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics. ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40% compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning. Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we introduce SpectrumLab, a pioneering unified platform designed to systematize and accelerate deep learning research in spectroscopy. SpectrumLab integrates three core components: a comprehensive Python library featuring essential data processing and evaluation tools, along with leaderboards; an innovative SpectrumAnnotator module that generates high-quality benchmarks from limited seed data; and SpectrumBench, a multi-layered benchmark suite covering 14 spectroscopic tasks and over 10 spectrum types, featuring spectra curated from over 1.2 million distinct chemical substances. Thorough empirical studies on SpectrumBench with 18 cutting-edge multimodal LLMs reveal critical limitations of current approaches. We hope SpectrumLab will serve as a crucial foundation for future advancements in deep learning-driven spectroscopy.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Status of Foundation Models for SAR Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21722v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive results, we still have a long way to go.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlotFM: A Motion Foundation Model with Slot Attention for Diverse Downstream Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21673v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wearable accelerometers are used for a wide range of applications, such as gesture recognition, gait analysis, and sports monitoring. Yet most existing foundation models focus primarily on classifying common daily activities such as locomotion and exercise, limiting their applicability to the broader range of tasks that rely on other signal characteristics. We present SlotFM, an accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong generalization for sensing foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MORPH: Shape-agnostic PDE Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21670v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning.</p></details> |  |
