| **[SpecSphere: Dual-Pass Spectral-Spatial Graph Neural Networks with Certified Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08320v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SpecSphere, the first dual-pass spectral-spatial GNN that certifies every prediction against both $\ell\_{0}$ edge flips and $\ell\_{\infty}$ feature perturbations, adapts to the full homophily-heterophily spectrum, and surpasses the expressive power of 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman while retaining linear-time complexity. Our model couples a Chebyshev-polynomial spectral branch with an attention-gated spatial branch and fuses their representations through a lightweight MLP trained in a cooperative-adversarial min-max game. We further establish (i) a uniform Chebyshev approximation theorem, (ii) minimax-optimal risk across the homophily-heterophily spectrum, (iii) closed-form robustness certificates, and (iv) universal approximation strictly beyond 1-WL. SpecSphere achieves state-of-the-art node-classification accuracy and delivers tighter certified robustness guarantees on real-world benchmarks. These results demonstrate that high expressivity, heterophily adaptation, and provable robustness can coexist within a single, scalable architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial public goods games with queueing and reputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09154v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world social and economic systems, the provisioning of public goods generally entails continuous interactions among individuals, with decisions to cooperate or defect being influenced by dynamic factors such as timing, resource availability, and the duration of engagement. However, the traditional public goods game ignores the asynchrony of the strategy adopted by players in the game. To address this problem, we propose a spatial public goods game that integrates an M/M/1 queueing system to simulate the dynamic flow of player interactions. We use a birth-death process to characterize the stochastic dynamics of this queueing system, with players arriving following a Poisson process and service times being exponentially distributed under a first-come-first-served basis with finite queue capacity. We also incorporate reputation so that players who have cooperated in the past are more likely to be chosen for future interactions. Our research shows that a high arrival rate, low service rate, and the reputation mechanism jointly facilitate the emergence of cooperative individuals in the network, which thus provides an interesting and new perspective for the provisioning of public goods.</p></details> |  |
| **[VGC-RIO: A Tightly Integrated Radar-Inertial Odometry with Spatial Weighted Doppler Velocity and Local Geometric Constrained RCS Histograms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09103v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in 4D radar-inertial odometry have demonstrated promising potential for autonomous lo calization in adverse conditions. However, effective handling of sparse and noisy radar measurements remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose a radar-inertial odometry with a spatial weighting method that adapts to unevenly distributed points and a novel point-description histogram for challenging point registration. To make full use of the Doppler velocity from different spatial sections, we propose a weighting calculation model. To enhance the point cloud registration performance under challenging scenarios, we con struct a novel point histogram descriptor that combines local geometric features and radar cross-section (RCS) features. We have also conducted extensive experiments on both public and self-constructed datasets. The results demonstrate the precision and robustness of the proposed VGC-RIO.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Quality Spatial Reconstruction and Orthoimage Generation Using Efficient 2D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19703v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Highly accurate geometric precision and dense image features characterize True Digital Orthophoto Maps (TDOMs), which are in great demand for applications such as urban planning, infrastructure management, and environmental monitoring.Traditional TDOM generation methods need sophisticated processes, such as Digital Surface Models (DSM) and occlusion detection, which are computationally expensive and prone to errors.This work presents an alternative technique rooted in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS), free of explicit DSM and occlusion detection. With depth map generation, spatial information for every pixel within the TDOM is retrieved and can reconstruct the scene with high precision. Divide-and-conquer strategy achieves excellent GS training and rendering with high-resolution TDOMs at a lower resource cost, which preserves higher quality of rendering on complex terrain and thin structure without a decrease in efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of large-scale scene reconstruction and high-precision terrain modeling. This approach provides accurate spatial data, which assists users in better planning and decision-making based on maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coordinated Spatial Reuse Scheduling With Machine Learning in IEEE 802.11 MAPC Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07278v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The densification of Wi-Fi deployments means that fully distributed random channel access is no longer sufficient for high and predictable performance. Therefore, the upcoming IEEE 802.11bn amendment introduces multi-access point coordination (MAPC) methods. This paper addresses a variant of MAPC called coordinated spatial reuse (C-SR), where devices transmit simultaneously on the same channel, with the power adjusted to minimize interference. The C-SR scheduling problem is selecting which devices transmit concurrently and with what settings. We provide a theoretical upper bound model, optimized for either throughput or fairness, which finds the best possible transmission schedule using mixed-integer linear programming. Then, a practical, probing-based approach is proposed which uses multi-armed bandits (MABs), a type of reinforcement learning, to solve the C-SR scheduling problem. We validate both classical (flat) MAB and hierarchical MAB (H-MAB) schemes with simulations and in a testbed. Using H-MABs for C-SR improves aggregate throughput over legacy IEEE 802.11 (on average by 80\% in random scenarios), without reducing the number of transmission opportunities per station. Finally, our framework is lightweight and ready for implementation in Wi-Fi devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 18 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Spatial Health Disparities Using Disease Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02086v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Epidemiologists commonly use regional aggregates of health outcomes to map mortality or incidence rates and identify geographic disparities. However, to detect health disparities across regions, it is necessary to identify "difference boundaries" that separate neighboring regions with significantly different spatial effects. This can be particularly challenging when dealing with multiple outcomes for each unit and accounting for dependence among diseases and across areal units. In this study, we address the issue of multivariate difference boundary detection for correlated diseases by formulating the problem in terms of Bayesian pairwise multiple comparisons by extending it through the introduction of adjacency modeling and disease graph dependencies. Specifically, we seek the posterior probabilities of neighboring spatial effects being different. To accomplish this, we adopt a class of multivariate areally referenced Dirichlet process models that accommodate spatial and interdisease dependence by endowing the spatial random effects with a discrete probability law. Our method is evaluated through simulation studies and applied to detect difference boundaries for multiple cancers using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Geography of Transportation Cybersecurity: Visitor Flows, Industry Clusters, and Spatial Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08822v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of the transportation cybersecurity ecosystem, encompassing cybersecurity, automotive, and transportation and logistics sectors, will lead to the formation of distinct spatial clusters and visitor flow patterns across the US. This study examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of visitor flows, analyzing how socioeconomic factors shape industry clustering and workforce distribution within these evolving sectors. To model and predict visitor flow patterns, we develop a BiTransGCN framework, integrating an attention-based Transformer architecture with a Graph Convolutional Network backbone. By integrating AI-enabled forecasting techniques with spatial analysis, this study improves our ability to track, interpret, and anticipate changes in industry clustering and mobility trends, thereby supporting strategic planning for a secure and resilient transportation network. It offers a data-driven foundation for economic planning, workforce development, and targeted investments in the transportation cybersecurity ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrated Bayesian non-parametric spatial modeling for cross-sample identification of spatially variable genes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09654v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized tissue analysis by simultaneously mapping gene expression, spatial topography, and histological context across consecutive tissue sections, enabling systematic investigation of spatial heterogeneity. The detection of spatially variable (SV) genes, which are molecular signatures with position-dependent expression, provides critical insights into disease mechanisms spanning oncology, neurology, and cardiovascular research. Current methodologies, however, confront dual constraints: predominant reliance on predefined spatial pattern templates restricts detection of novel complex spatial architectures, and inconsistent sample selection strategies compromise analytical stability and biological interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical framework incorporating non-parametric spatial modeling and across-sample integration. It takes advantage of the non-parametric technique and develops an adaptive spatial process accommodating complex pattern discovery while maintaining biological interpretability. A novel cross-sample bi-level shrinkage prior is further introduced for robust multi-sample SV gene detection, facilitating more effective information fusion. An efficient variational inference is developed for posterior inference ensuring computational scalability. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the improved performance of our proposed method over existing analytical frameworks, and its application to DLPFC data reveals interpretable SV genes whose spatial patterns delineate neuroanatomically relevant clusters and gradients, advancing brain transcriptomics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient 3D Perception on Multi-Sweep Point Cloud with Gumbel Spatial Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07742v4)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies point cloud perception within outdoor environments. Existing methods face limitations in recognizing objects located at a distance or occluded, due to the sparse nature of outdoor point clouds. In this work, we observe a significant mitigation of this problem by accumulating multiple temporally consecutive point cloud sweeps, resulting in a remarkable improvement in perception accuracy. However, the computation cost also increases, hindering previous approaches from utilizing a large number of point cloud sweeps. To tackle this challenge, we find that a considerable portion of points in the accumulated point cloud is redundant, and discarding these points has minimal impact on perception accuracy. We introduce a simple yet effective Gumbel Spatial Pruning (GSP) layer that dynamically prunes points based on a learned end-to-end sampling. The GSP layer is decoupled from other network components and thus can be seamlessly integrated into existing point cloud network architectures. Without incurring additional computational overhead, we increase the number of point cloud sweeps from 10, a common practice, to as many as 40. Consequently, there is a significant enhancement in perception performance. For instance, in nuScenes 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation tasks, our pruning strategy improves several 3D perception baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Confounding in Multivariate Areal Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07232v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate spatial confounding in the presence of multivariate disease dependence. In the "analysis model perspective" of spatial confounding, adding a spatially dependent random effect can lead to significant variance inflation of the posterior distribution of the fixed effects. The "data generation perspective" views covariates as stochastic and correlated with an unobserved spatial confounder, leading to inferior statistical inference over multiple realizations. While multiple methods have been proposed for adjusting statistical models to mitigate spatial confounding in estimating regression coefficients, results on interactions between spatial confounding and multivariate dependence are very limited. We contribute to this domain by investigating spatial confounding from the analysis and data generation perspectives in a Bayesian coregionalized areal regression model. We derive novel results that distinguish variance inflation due to spatial confounding from inflation based on multicollinearity between predictors and provide insights into the estimation efficiency of a spatial estimator under a spatially confounded data generation model. We demonstrate favorable performance of spatial analysis compared to a non-spatial model in our simulation experiments even in the presence of spatial confounding and a misspecified spatial structure. In this regard, we align with several other authors in the defense of traditional hierarchical spatial models (Gilbert et al., 2025; Khan and Berrett, 2023; Zimmerman and Ver Hoef, 2022) and extend this defense to multivariate areal models. We analyze county-level data from the US on obesity / diabetes prevalence and diabetes-related cancer mortality, comparing the results with and without spatial random effects.</p></details> | 26 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Jointly spatial-temporal representation learning for individual trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04055v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual trajectories, rich in human-environment interaction information across space and time, serve as vital inputs for geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs). However, existing attempts at learning trajectory representations have overlooked the implicit spatial-temporal dependency within trajectories, failing to encode such dependency in a deep learning-friendly format. That poses a challenge in obtaining general-purpose trajectory representations. Therefore, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal joint representation learning method (ST-GraphRL) to formalize learnable spatial-temporal dependencies into trajectory representations. The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a weighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility interactions in both space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage jointly encoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion), to learn entangled spatial-temporal dependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating space and time information; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn explicit mobility regularities by simulating the spatial-temporal distributions of trajectories. Tested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed ST-GraphRL outperformed all the baseline models in predicting movement spatial-temporal distributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal correlations. Analyzing spatial-temporal features presented in latent space validates that ST-GraphRL understands spatial-temporal patterns. This study may also benefit representation learnings of other geospatial data to achieve general-purpose data representations and advance GeoFMs development.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 3 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[OmniAudio: Generating Spatial Audio from 360-Degree Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14906v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional video-to-audio generation techniques primarily focus on field-of-view (FoV) video and non-spatial audio, often missing the spatial cues necessary for accurately representing sound sources in 3D environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel task, 360V2SA, to generate spatial audio from 360-degree videos, specifically producing First-order Ambisonics (FOA) audio - a standard format for representing 3D spatial audio that captures sound directionality and enables realistic 3D audio reproduction. We first create Sphere360, a novel dataset tailored for this task that is curated from real-world data. We also design an efficient semi-automated pipeline for collecting and cleaning paired video-audio data. To generate spatial audio from 360-degree video, we propose a novel framework OmniAudio, which leverages self-supervised pre-training using both spatial audio data (in FOA format) and large-scale non-spatial data. Furthermore, OmniAudio features a dual-branch framework that utilizes both panoramic and FoV video inputs to capture comprehensive local and global information from 360-degree videos. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective metrics on Sphere360. Code and datasets will be released at https://github.com/liuhuadai/OmniAudio. The demo page is available at https://OmniAudio-360V2SA.github.io.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Price Equilibria in a Spatial Competition with Captive Buyers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06961v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores price competition with exogenous product differentiation in a spatial model similar to that of Nakagawa (2023). Nakagawa examines product differentiation within the framework of Varian (1980). Nakagawa integrates Varian's concept of uninformed consumers, who lack complete price information, into a spatial model based on Hotelling (1929). While Nakagawa placed informed consumers at the center of the Hotelling line and used quadratic transportation costs, our study employs a uniform distribution of informed consumers and linear transportation costs. This approach enables a more direct comparison with established spatial competition literature, particularly Osborne and Pitchik (1987). We classify equilibrium candidates and characterize the parameter regions corresponding to each equilibrium. There is no pure equilibrium in the region where we construct mixed strategy equilibria. Furthermore, we compare the expected profit in the equilibrium of our model with the findings of Osborne and Pitchik (1987). Finally, we discuss the impact of captive buyers on the nature of spatial competition.</p></details> | 44 pages, 13 figures |
| **[AudioMiXR: Spatial Audio Object Manipulation with 6DoF for Sound Design in Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02929v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present AudioMiXR, an augmented reality (AR) interface intended to assess how users manipulate virtual audio objects situated in their physical space using six degrees of freedom (6DoF) deployed on a head-mounted display (Apple Vision Pro) for 3D sound design. Existing tools for 3D sound design are typically constrained to desktop displays, which may limit spatial awareness of mixing within the execution environment. Utilizing an XR HMD to create soundscapes may provide a real-time test environment for 3D sound design, as modern HMDs can provide precise spatial localization assisted by cross-modal interactions. However, there is no research on design guidelines specific to sound design with six degrees of freedom (6DoF) in XR. To provide a first step toward identifying design-related research directions in this space, we conducted an exploratory study where we recruited 27 participants, consisting of expert and non-expert sound designers. The goal was to assess design lessons that can be used to inform future research venues in 3D sound design. We ran a within-subjects study where users designed both a music and cinematic soundscapes. After thematically analyzing participant data, we constructed two design lessons: 1. Proprioception for AR Sound Design, and 2. Balancing Audio-Visual Modalities in AR GUIs. Additionally, we provide application domains that can benefit most from 6DoF sound design based on our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revision necessary for accuracy</p></details> |
| **[Inference on Dynamic Spatial Autoregressive Models with Change Point Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18773v3)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze a varying-coefficient dynamic spatial autoregressive model with spatial fixed effects. One salient feature of the model is the incorporation of multiple spatial weight matrices through their linear combinations with varying coefficients, which help solve the problem of choosing the most ``correct'' one for applied econometricians who often face the availability of multiple expert spatial weight matrices. We estimate and make inferences on the model coefficients and coefficients in basis expansions of the varying coefficients through penalized estimations, establishing the oracle properties of the estimators and the consistency of the overall estimated spatial weight matrix, which can be time-dependent. We further consider two applications of our model in change point detections in dynamic spatial autoregressive models, providing theoretical justifications in consistent change point locations estimation and practical implementations. Simulation experiments demonstrate the performance of our proposed methodology, and real data analyses are also carried out.</p></details> | 58 pages, 7 figure |
| **[Structure-preserving contrastive learning for spatial time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06380v3)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of neural network models largely relies on learning meaningful latent patterns from data, where self-supervised learning of informative representations can enhance model performance and generalisability. However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations. This provides insights to design more effective neural networks for data-driven transportation research. Our code is made openly accessible with all resulting data at https://github.com/yiru-jiao/spclt</p></details> | <details><summary>TL;DR...</summary><p>TL;DR: Preserving certain structures of similarity relations in spatio-temporal data can improve downstream task performance via contrastive learning</p></details> |
| **[Generalizing Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods to probe for spatial correlations in temporal networks and infer their topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16070v3)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motifs are thought to be some fundamental components of social face-to-face interaction temporal networks. However, the motifs previously considered are either limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles, which are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of social systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these triangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be mined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the edge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods motifs of the literature. We also confirm in empirical data that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to the Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show how mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for spatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that network. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the edge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions. In the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the edge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network they were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development, that we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.</p></details> |  |

| **[Budgeted Spatial Data Acquisition: When Coverage and Connectivity Matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04853v4)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data is undoubtedly becoming a commodity like oil, land, and labor in the 21st century. Although there have been many successful marketplaces for data trading, the existing data marketplaces lack consideration of the case where buyers want to acquire a collection of datasets (instead of one), and the overall spatial coverage and connectivity matter. In this paper, we take the first attempt to formulate this problem as Budgeted Maximum Coverage with Connectivity Constraint (BMCC), which aims to acquire a dataset collection with the maximum spatial coverage under a limited budget while maintaining spatial connectivity. To solve the problem, we propose two approximate algorithms with detailed theoretical guarantees and time complexity analysis, followed by two acceleration strategies to further improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Experiments are conducted on five real-world spatial dataset collections to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS), with the DOI: {10.1007/s11704-025-41427-9}</p></details> |
| **[GeoThinneR: An R Package for Efficient Spatial Thinning of Species Occurrences and Point Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07867v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we present GeoThinneR, an R package for efficient and flexible spatial thinning of species occurrence data. Spatial thinning is a widely used preprocessing step in species distribution modeling (SDM) that can help reduce sampling bias, but existing R implementations rely on brute-force algorithms that scale poorly with large datasets. GeoThinneR implements multiple thinning approaches, including ensuring a minimum distance between points, subsampling points on a grid, and filtering based on decimal precision. To handle large datasets, it introduces two optimized algorithms based on local kd-trees and adaptive neighbor estimation, which greatly reduce memory usage and execution time. Additional functionalities such as group-wise thinning and point prioritization are included to facilitate its use in SDM workflows. We here provide performance benchmarks using both simulated and real-world data to demonstrate substantial performance improvements over existing tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Satellite Object Localization with Dilated Convolutions and Attention-aided Spatial Pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05599v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object localization in satellite imagery is particularly challenging due to the high variability of objects, low spatial resolution, and interference from noise and dominant features such as clouds and city lights. In this research, we focus on three satellite datasets: upper atmospheric Gravity Waves (GW), mesospheric Bores (Bore), and Ocean Eddies (OE), each presenting its own unique challenges. These challenges include the variability in the scale and appearance of the main object patterns, where the size, shape, and feature extent of objects of interest can differ significantly. To address these challenges, we introduce YOLO-DCAP, a novel enhanced version of YOLOv5 designed to improve object localization in these complex scenarios. YOLO-DCAP incorporates a Multi-scale Dilated Residual Convolution (MDRC) block to capture multi-scale features at scale with varying dilation rates, and an Attention-aided Spatial Pooling (AaSP) module to focus on the global relevant spatial regions, enhancing feature selection. These structural improvements help to better localize objects in satellite imagery. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-DCAP significantly outperforms both the YOLO base model and state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average improvement of 20.95% in mAP50 and 32.23% in IoU over the base model, and 7.35% and 9.84% respectively over state-of-the-art alternatives, consistently across all three satellite datasets. These consistent gains across all three satellite datasets highlight the robustness and generalizability of the proposed approach. Our code is open sourced at https://github.com/AI-4-atmosphere-remote-sensing/satellite-object-localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to International conference on Advanced Machine Learning and Data Science (AMLDS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[SITE: towards Spatial Intelligence Thorough Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05456v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence (SI) represents a cognitive ability encompassing the visualization, manipulation, and reasoning about spatial relationships, underpinning disciplines from neuroscience to robotics. We introduce SITE, a benchmark dataset towards SI Thorough Evaluation in a standardized format of multi-choice visual question-answering, designed to assess large vision-language models' spatial intelligence across diverse visual modalities (single-image, multi-image, and video) and SI factors (figural to environmental scales, spatial visualization and orientation, intrinsic and extrinsic, static and dynamic). Our approach to curating the benchmark combines a bottom-up survey about 31 existing datasets and a top-down strategy drawing upon three classification systems in cognitive science, which prompt us to design two novel types of tasks about view-taking and dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments reveal that leading models fall behind human experts especially in spatial orientation, a fundamental SI factor. Moreover, we demonstrate a positive correlation between a model's spatial reasoning proficiency and its performance on an embodied AI task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmented Deep Contexts for Spatially Embedded Video Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05309v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most Neural Video Codecs (NVCs) only employ temporal references to generate temporal-only contexts and latent prior. These temporal-only NVCs fail to handle large motions or emerging objects due to limited contexts and misaligned latent prior. To relieve the limitations, we propose a Spatially Embedded Video Codec (SEVC), in which the low-resolution video is compressed for spatial references. Firstly, our SEVC leverages both spatial and temporal references to generate augmented motion vectors and hybrid spatial-temporal contexts. Secondly, to address the misalignment issue in latent prior and enrich the prior information, we introduce a spatial-guided latent prior augmented by multiple temporal latent representations. At last, we design a joint spatial-temporal optimization to learn quality-adaptive bit allocation for spatial references, further boosting rate-distortion performance. Experimental results show that our SEVC effectively alleviates the limitations in handling large motions or emerging objects, and also reduces 11.9% more bitrate than the previous state-of-the-art NVC while providing an additional low-resolution bitstream. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/EsakaK/SEVC.</p></details> | 15 pages,CVPR |

They enable municipalities to monitor mitigation strategies and foster engagement among governments, businesses, and communities. However, smaller municipalities often face data limitations that hinder tailored climate strategies. This study generates detailed final energy consumption and emissions data at the local administrative level for Germany and Spain. Using national datasets, we apply spatial disaggregation techniques with open data sources. A key innovation is the application of XGBoost for imputing missing data, combined with a stepwise spatial disaggregation process incorporating district- and province-level statistics. Prioritizing reproducibility, our open-data approach provides a scalable framework for municipalities to develop actionable climate plans. To ensure transparency, we assess the reliability of imputed values and assign confidence ratings to the disaggregated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages of text, 13 figures, 22 tables</p></details> |
| **[3DSRBench: A Comprehensive 3D Spatial Reasoning Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07825v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D spatial reasoning is the ability to analyze and interpret the positions, orientations, and spatial relationships of objects within the 3D space. This allows models to develop a comprehensive understanding of the 3D scene, enabling their applicability to a broader range of areas, such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and AR/VR. While large multi-modal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in a wide range of image and video understanding tasks, their capabilities to perform 3D spatial reasoning on diverse natural images are less studied. In this work we present the first comprehensive 3D spatial reasoning benchmark, 3DSRBench, with 2,772 manually annotated visual question-answer pairs across 12 question types. We conduct robust and thorough evaluation of 3D spatial reasoning capabilities by balancing the data distribution and adopting a novel FlipEval strategy. To further study the robustness of 3D spatial reasoning w.r.t. camera 3D viewpoints, our 3DSRBench includes two subsets with 3D spatial reasoning questions on paired images with common and uncommon viewpoints. We benchmark a wide range of open-sourced and proprietary LMMs, uncovering their limitations in various aspects of 3D awareness, such as height, orientation, location, and multi-object reasoning, as well as their degraded performance on images with uncommon camera viewpoints.

| **[Anonymous Self-Stabilising Localisation via Spatial Population Protocols](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08434v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the distributed localization problem (DLP), $n$ anonymous robots (agents) $a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}$ begin at arbitrary positions $p_0, ..., p_{n-1}$ in $S$, where $S$ is an Euclidean space. The primary goal in DLP is for agents to reach a consensus on a unified coordinate system that accurately reflects the relative positions of all points, $p_0, ..., p_{n-1}$. Extensive research on DLP has primarily focused on the feasibility and complexity of achieving consensus when agents have limited access to inter-agent distances, often due to missing or imprecise data. In this paper, however, we examine a minimalist, computationally efficient model of distributed computing in which agents have access to all pairwise distances, if needed. Specifically, we introduce a novel variant of population protocols, referred to as the spatial population protocols model. In this variant each agent can memorise one or a fixed number of coordinates, and when agents $a_i$ and $a_j$ interact, they can not only exchange their current knowledge but also either determine the distance $d(i,j)$ between them in $S$ (distance query model) or obtain the vector $v(i,j)$ spanning points $p_i$ and $p_j$ (vector query model). We propose several localisation protocols, including: (1) Two leader-based protocols with distance queries, stabilizing silently in $o(n)$ time using an efficient multi-contact epidemic, a generalization of the one-way epidemic in population protocols; (2) A distance-based protocol self-stabilizing silently in $O(n(\log n/n)^{1/(k+1)}\log n)$ time in $k$-dimensions, leveraging a leader election mechanism; (3) An optimally fast protocol with vector queries, self-stabilizing silently in $O(\log n)$ time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a brief announcement for SAND 2025</p></details> |

Unlike existing methods that rely on expensive 3D-specific fine-tuning with specialized 3D inputs such as point clouds or voxel-based features, SpatialPrompting employs a keyframe-driven prompt generation strategy. This framework uses metrics such as vision-language similarity, Mahalanobis distance, field of view, and image sharpness to select a diverse and informative set of keyframes from image sequences and then integrates them with corresponding camera pose data to effectively abstract spatial relationships and infer complex 3D structures. The proposed framework not only establishes a new paradigm for flexible spatial reasoning that utilizes intuitive visual and positional cues but also achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on benchmark datasets, such as ScanQA and SQA3D, across several metrics. The proposed method effectively eliminates the need for specialized 3D inputs and fine-tuning, offering a simpler and more scalable alternative to conventional approaches.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |

Leveraging neural text-to-speech synthesis with FastSpeech 2 and VALL-E for expressive narration and character-specific voices, the framework employs advanced language models to automatically interpret textual narratives and generate realistic spatial audio effects. These sound effects are dynamically synchronized with the storyline through sophisticated temporal integration methods, including Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Diffusion-based generative models combined with higher-order ambisonics (HOA) and scattering delay networks (SDN) enable highly realistic 3D soundscapes, substantially enhancing listener immersion and narrative realism. This technology significantly advances audiobook applications, providing richer experiences for educational content, storytelling platforms, and accessibility solutions for visually impaired audiences. Future work will address personalization, ethical management of synthesized voices, and integration with multi-sensory platforms.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a theoretical analysis of two adaptive detectors for GDD in scenarios with known spatial steering vectors.

| **[Texture Image Synthesis Using Spatial GAN Based on Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01842v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Texture synthesis is a fundamental task in computer vision, whose goal is to generate visually realistic and structurally coherent textures for a wide range of applications, from graphics to scientific simulations. While traditional methods like tiling and patch-based techniques often struggle with complex textures, recent advancements in deep learning have transformed this field. In this paper, we propose ViT-SGAN, a new hybrid model that fuses Vision Transformers (ViTs) with a Spatial Generative Adversarial Network (SGAN) to address the limitations of previous methods. By incorporating specialized texture descriptors such as mean-variance (mu, sigma) and textons into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, our model achieves superior texture synthesis. This approach enhances the model's capacity to capture complex spatial dependencies, leading to improved texture quality that is superior to state-of-the-art models, especially for regular and irregular textures. Comparison experiments with metrics such as FID, IS, SSIM, and LPIPS demonstrate the substantial improvement of ViT-SGAN, which underlines its efficiency in generating diverse realistic textures.</p></details> | Preprint |

A novel deep reinforcement learning framework, Proximal Policy Optimization with Adversarial Curriculum Transfer (PPO-ACT), is proposed to model agent strategy optimization in dynamic environments. Traditional evolutionary game models frequently exhibit limitations in modeling long-term decision-making processes. Deep reinforcement learning effectively addresses this limitation by bridging policy gradient methods with evolutionary game theory. Our study pioneers the application of proximal policy optimization's continuous strategy optimization capability to public goods games through a two-stage adversarial curriculum transfer training paradigm. The experimental results show that PPO-ACT performs better in critical enhancement factor regimes. Compared to conventional standard proximal policy optimization methods, Q-learning and Fermi update rules, achieve earlier cooperation phase transitions and maintain stable cooperative equilibria. This framework exhibits better robustness when handling challenging scenarios like all-defector initial conditions. Systematic comparisons reveal the unique advantage of policy gradient methods in population-scale cooperation, i.e., achieving spatiotemporal payoff coordination through value function propagation. Our work provides a new computational framework for studying cooperation emergence in complex systems, algorithmically validating the punishment promotes cooperation hypothesis while offering methodological insights for multi-agent system strategy design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Task Offloading and Channel Allocation in Spatial-Temporal Dynamic for MEC Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04272v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computation offloading and resource allocation are critical in mobile edge computing (MEC) systems to handle the massive and complex requirements of applications restricted by limited resources. In a multi-user multi-server MEC network, the mobility of terminals causes computing requests to be dynamically distributed in space. At the same time, the non-negligible dependencies among tasks in some specific applications impose temporal correlation constraints on the solution as well, leading the time-adjacent tasks to experience varying resource availability and competition from parallel counterparts. To address such dynamic spatial-temporal characteristics as a challenge in the allocation of communication and computation resources, we formulate a long-term delay-energy trade-off cost minimization problem in the view of jointly optimizing task offloading and resource allocation. We begin by designing a priority evaluation scheme to decouple task dependencies and then develop a grouped Knapsack problem for channel allocation considering the current data load and channel status. Afterward, in order to meet the rapid response needs of MEC systems, we exploit the double duel deep Q network (D3QN) to make offloading decisions and integrate channel allocation results into the reward as part of the dynamic environment feedback in D3QN, constituting the joint optimization of task offloading and channel allocation. Finally, comprehensive simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in the delay-energy trade-off cost and its adaptability for various applications.</p></details> |  |

The discrete spatial distribution and the super-high dimensional sequencing results make ST data challenging to be modeled effectively. In this paper, we manage to model ST in a continuous and compact manner by the proposed tool, SUICA, empowered by the great approximation capability of Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that can enhance both the spatial density and the gene expression. Concretely within the proposed SUICA, we incorporate a graph-augmented Autoencoder to effectively model the context information of the unstructured spots and provide informative embeddings that are structure-aware for spatial mapping. We also tackle the extremely skewed distribution in a regression-by-classification fashion and enforce classification-based loss functions for the optimization of SUICA. By extensive experiments of a wide range of common ST platforms under varying degradations, SUICA outperforms both conventional INR variants and SOTA methods regarding numerical fidelity, statistical correlation, and bio-conservation. The prediction by SUICA also showcases amplified gene signatures that enriches the bio-conservation of the raw data and benefits subsequent analysis.

The significant gap between 3D and language modalities makes it a notable challenge to distinguish multiple similar objects through the described spatial relationships. Current methods attempt to achieve cross-modal understanding in complex scenes via a target-centered learning mechanism, ignoring the perception of referred objects. We propose a novel 2D-assisted 3D visual grounding framework that constructs semantic-spatial scene graphs with referred object discrimination for relationship perception. The framework incorporates a dual-branch visual encoder that utilizes 2D pre-trained attributes to guide the multi-modal object encoding. Furthermore, our cross-modal interaction module uses graph attention to facilitate relationship-oriented information fusion. The enhanced object representation and iterative relational learning enable the model to establish effective alignment between 3D vision and referential descriptions. Experimental results on the popular benchmarks demonstrate our superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially in addressing the challenges of multiple similar distractors.</p></details> |  |

However, THz signal propagation differs significantly from lower-frequency bands due to severe free space path loss, minimal diffraction and specular reflection, and prominent scattering, making conventional channel modeling and pilot-based estimation approaches inefficient. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of applying radio radiance field (RRF) framework to the THz band. This method reconstructs a continuous RRF using visual-based geometry and sparse THz RF measurements, enabling efficient spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI) modeling without dense sampling. We first build a fine simulated THz scenario, then we reconstruct the RRF and evaluate the performance in terms of both reconstruction quality and effectiveness in THz communication, showing that the reconstructed RRF captures key propagation paths with sparse training samples. Our findings demonstrate that RRF modeling remains effective in the THz regime and provides a promising direction for scalable, low-cost spatial channel reconstruction in future 6G networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE conferences</p></details> |

Users frequently require aggregated statistical information derived from historical sensory data within specific spatial and temporal boundaries. To address this, users submit aggregation query requests with spatial-temporal constraints to target UAVs that store the relevant data. These UAVs process and return the query results, which can be aggregated within the network during transmission to conserve energy and bandwidth-resources that are inherently limited in UAV networks. However,the dynamic topology caused by UAV mobility, coupled with these resource constraints, makes efficient in-network aggregation challenging without compromising user query delay. To the best of our knowledge, existing research has yet to adequately explore spatial-temporal range aggregation queries in the context of UAV networks. In this paper, we propose ESTA, an Efficient Spatial-Temporal range Aggregation query processing algorithm tailored for UAV networks. ESTA leverages pre-planned UAV trajectories to construct a topology change graph that models the network's evolving connectivity. It then employs an efficient shortest path algorithm to determine the minimum query response delay. Subsequently, while adhering to user-specified delay constraints, ESTA transforms the in-network aggregation process into a series of set cover problems, which are solved recursively to build a Spatial-Temporal Aggregation Tree (STAT). This tree enables the identification of an energy-efficient routing path for aggregating and delivering query results. Extensive simulations demonstrate that ESTA reduces energy consumption by more than 50% compared to a baseline algorithm, all while satisfying the required query delay.</p></details> | 15 pages, 14 figures |

However, existing systems such as Simba and Sedona, which incorporate distributed spatial indexing, still incur substantial index construction overheads, rendering them far from optimal for real-time analytics. Recent studies demonstrate that learned indices can achieve high efficiency through well-designed machine learning models, but how to design a learned index for distributed spatial analytics remains unaddressed. In this paper, we present LiLIS, a Lightweight Distributed Learned Index for big spatial data. LiLIS combines machine-learned search strategies with spatial-aware partitioning within a distributed framework, and efficiently implements common spatial queries, including point query, range query, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and spatial joins. Extensive experimental results over real-world and synthetic datasets show that LiLIS outperforms state-of-the-art big spatial data analytics by $2-3$ orders of magnitude for most spatial queries, and the index building achieves $1.5-2\times$ speed-up.

However, the scarcity of labeled HSI data limits the full potential of deep learning, especially for transformer-based architectures that require large-scale training. To address this constraint, we propose Spatial-Frequency Masked Image Modeling (SFMIM), a self-supervised pretraining strategy for hyperspectral data that utilizes the large portion of unlabeled data. Our method introduces a novel dual-domain masking mechanism that operates in both spatial and frequency domains. The input HSI cube is initially divided into non-overlapping patches along the spatial dimension, with each patch comprising the entire spectrum of its corresponding spatial location. In spatial masking, we randomly mask selected patches and train the model to reconstruct the masked inputs using the visible patches. Concurrently, in frequency masking, we remove portions of the frequency components of the input spectra and predict the missing frequencies. By learning to reconstruct these masked components, the transformer-based encoder captures higher-order spectral-spatial correlations. We evaluate our approach on three publicly available HSI classification benchmarks and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our model shows rapid convergence during fine-tuning, highlighting the efficiency of our pretraining strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint to appear in IEEE IGARSS 2025</p></details> |

Recent computational advancements allow efficient, relatively simple, and quick approximate Bayesian estimation for MRP. As population health outcomes of interest including vaccination uptake are known to have spatial structure, precision may be gained by including space in the model. We test a recently proposed spatial MRP method that includes a BYM2 spatial term that smooths across demographics and geographic areas using a large, unrepresentative survey. We produce California county-level estimates of first-dose COVID-19 vaccination up to June 2021 using classic and spatial MRP models, and poststratify using data from the American Community Survey (US Census Bureau). We assess validity using reported first-dose vaccination counts from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Neither classic nor spatial MRP models performed well, highlighting: 1. spatial MRP may be most appropriate for richer data contexts, 2. some demographics in the survey data are over-sampled and -aggregated, producing model over-smoothing, and 3. a need for survey producers to share user-representative metrics to better benchmark estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages (13 main article + 23 pages of appendix), 4 figures.

To overcome this issue, we present a spatial autoregressive modeling framework, which maps observations at a location and its neighbors to independent random variables. This is a highly flexible modeling approach and well-suited for non-Gaussian fields, providing simpler interpretability. In particular, we consider the SAR model with Generalized Extreme Value distribution innovations to combine the observation at a central grid location with its neighbors, capturing extreme spatial behavior based on the heavy-tailed innovations. While these models are fast to simulate by exploiting the sparsity of the key matrices in the computations, the maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters is prohibitive due to the intractability of the likelihood, making optimization challenging. To overcome this, we train a convolutional neural network on a large training set that covers a useful parameter space, and then use the trained network for fast parameter estimation. Finally, we apply this model to analyze annual maximum precipitation data from ERA-Interim-driven Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations, allowing us to explore its spatial extreme behavior across North America.</p></details> |  |

Among the various Spatial Transcriptomics techniques available, Visium has emerged as the most widely adopted. However, its accessibility is limited by high costs, the need for specialized expertise, and slow clinical integration. Additionally, gene capture inefficiencies lead to significant dropout, corrupting acquired data. To address these challenges, the deep learning community has explored the gene expression prediction task directly from histology images. Yet, inconsistencies in datasets, preprocessing, and training protocols hinder fair comparisons between models. To bridge this gap, we introduce SpaRED, a systematically curated database comprising 26 public datasets, providing a standardized resource for model evaluation. We further propose SpaCKLE, a state-of-the-art transformer-based gene expression completion model that reduces mean squared error by over 82.5% compared to existing approaches. Finally, we establish the SpaRED benchmark, evaluating eight state-of-the-art prediction models on both raw and SpaCKLE-completed data, demonstrating SpaCKLE substantially improves the results across all the gene expression prediction models. Altogether, our contributions constitute the most comprehensive benchmark of gene expression prediction from histology images to date and a stepping stone for future research on Spatial Transcriptomics.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2407.13027</p></details> |

This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE.

However, base models face limitations, as they only contain the knowledge available at the time of training, and updating them is both time-consuming and costly. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged in the literature as the preferred approach for injecting contextual information into Foundation Models. It prevails over techniques such as fine-tuning, which are less effective in dynamic, real-time scenarios like those found in urban environments. However, traditional RAG architectures, based on semantic databases, knowledge graphs, structured data, or AI-powered web searches, do not fully meet the demands of urban contexts. Urban environments are complex systems characterized by large volumes of interconnected data, frequent updates, real-time processing requirements, security needs, and strong links to the physical world. This work proposes a real-time spatial RAG architecture that defines the necessary components for the effective integration of generative AI into cities, leveraging temporal and spatial filtering capabilities through linked data. The proposed architecture is implemented using FIWARE, an ecosystem of software components to develop smart city solutions and digital twins. The design and implementation are demonstrated through the use case of a tourism assistant in the city of Madrid. The use case serves to validate the correct integration of Foundation Models through the proposed RAG architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unaligned RGB Guided Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution with Spatial-Spectral Concordance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02109v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral images super-resolution aims to improve the spatial resolution, yet its performance is often limited at high-resolution ratios. The recent adoption of high-resolution reference images for super-resolution is driven by the poor spatial detail found in low-resolution HSIs, presenting it as a favorable method. However, these approaches cannot effectively utilize information from the reference image, due to the inaccuracy of alignment and its inadequate interaction between alignment and fusion modules. In this paper, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Concordance Hyperspectral Super-Resolution (SSC-HSR) framework for unaligned reference RGB guided HSI SR to address the issues of inaccurate alignment and poor interactivity of the previous approaches. Specifically, to ensure spatial concordance, i.e., align images more accurately across resolutions and refine textures, we construct a Two-Stage Image Alignment with a synthetic generation pipeline in the image alignment module, where the fine-tuned optical flow model can produce a more accurate optical flow in the first stage and warp model can refine damaged textures in the second stage. To enhance the interaction between alignment and fusion modules and ensure spectral concordance during reconstruction, we propose a Feature Aggregation module and an Attention Fusion module. In the feature aggregation module, we introduce an Iterative Deformable Feature Aggregation block to achieve significant feature matching and texture aggregation with the fusion multi-scale results guidance, iteratively generating learnable offset. Besides, we introduce two basic spectral-wise attention blocks in the attention fusion module to model the inter-spectra interactions. Extensive experiments on three natural or remote-sensing datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonparametric Monitoring of Spatial Dependence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17022v2)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In process monitoring, it is common for measurements to be taken regularly or randomly from different spatial locations in two or three dimensions. While there are nonparametric methods for process monitoring with such spatial data to detect changes in the mean, there is a gap in the literature for nonparametric control charting methods developed to monitor spatial dependence. This study considers streams of regular, rectangular data sets using spatial ordinal patterns (SOPs) as a nonparametric method to detect spatial dependencies. We propose novel SOP control charts, which are distribution-free and do not require prior Phase-I analysis. To uncover higher-order dependencies, we develop a new class of statistics that combines SOPs with the Box-Pierce approach. An extensive simulation study demonstrates the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed charts over traditional parametric approaches, particularly when the spatial dependence is nonlinear or bilateral or when the spatial data contains outliers. The proposed SOP control charts are illustrated using real-world datasets to detect (i) heavy rainfall in Germany, (ii) war-related fires in (eastern) Ukraine, and (iii) manufacturing defects in textile production. This wide range of applications and findings demonstrates the broad utility of the proposed nonparametric control charts. In addition, all methods in this study are provided as a publicly available \texttt{Julia} package on \href{https://github.com/AdaemmerP/OrdinalPatterns.jl}{GitHub} for further implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 9 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |
| **[Evaluation of Thermal Control Based on Spatial Thermal Comfort with Reconstructed Environmental Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00468v2)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving thermal comfort while maintaining energy efficiency is a critical objective in building system control. Conventional thermal comfort models, such as the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), rely on both environmental and personal variables. However, the use of fixed-location sensors limits the ability to capture spatial variability, which reduces the accuracy of occupant-specific comfort estimation. To address this limitation, this study proposes a new PMV estimation method that incorporates spatial environmental data reconstructed using the Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (Gappy POD) algorithm. In addition, a group PMV-based control framework is developed to account for the thermal comfort of multiple occupants. The Gappy POD method enables fast and accurate reconstruction of indoor temperature fields from sparse sensor measurements. Using these reconstructed fields and occupant location data, spatially resolved PMV values are calculated. Group-level thermal conditions are then derived through statistical aggregation methods and used to control indoor temperature in a multi-occupant living lab environment. Experimental results show that the Gappy POD algorithm achieves an average relative error below 3\% in temperature reconstruction. PMV distributions varied by up to 1.26 scale units depending on occupant location. Moreover, thermal satisfaction outcomes varied depending on the group PMV method employed. These findings underscore the importance for adaptive thermal control strategies that incorporate both spatial and individual variability, offering valuable insights for future occupant-centric building operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Spatial Diffusion: Intensity-Preserving Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01917v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in producing high-quality images. However, because these models typically operate in continuous intensity spaces - diffusing independently per pixel and color channel - they are fundamentally ill-suited for applications where quantities such as particle counts or material units are inherently discrete and governed by strict conservation laws such as mass preservation, limiting their applicability in scientific workflows. To address this limitation, we propose Discrete Spatial Diffusion (DSD), a framework based on a continuous-time, discrete-state jump stochastic process that operates directly in discrete spatial domains while strictly preserving mass in both forward and reverse diffusion processes. By using spatial diffusion to achieve mass preservation, we introduce stochasticity naturally through a discrete formulation. We demonstrate the expressive flexibility of DSD by performing image synthesis, class conditioning, and image inpainting across widely-used image benchmarks, with the ability to condition on image intensity. Additionally, we highlight its applicability to domain-specific scientific data for materials microstructure, bridging the gap between diffusion models and mass-conditioned scientific applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreeInsert: Disentangled Text-Guided Object Insertion in 3D Gaussian Scene without Spatial Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01322v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven object insertion in 3D scenes is an emerging task that enables intuitive scene editing through natural language. However, existing 2D editing-based methods often rely on spatial priors such as 2D masks or 3D bounding boxes, and they struggle to ensure consistency of the inserted object. These limitations hinder flexibility and scalability in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose FreeInsert, a novel framework that leverages foundation models including MLLMs, LGMs, and diffusion models to disentangle object generation from spatial placement. This enables unsupervised and flexible object insertion in 3D scenes without spatial priors. FreeInsert starts with an MLLM-based parser that extracts structured semantics, including object types, spatial relationships, and attachment regions, from user instructions. These semantics guide both the reconstruction of the inserted object for 3D consistency and the learning of its degrees of freedom. We leverage the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to initialize object pose and scale. A hierarchical, spatially aware refinement stage further integrates spatial semantics and MLLM-inferred priors to enhance placement. Finally, the appearance of the object is improved using the inserted-object image to enhance visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that FreeInsert achieves semantically coherent, spatially precise, and visually realistic 3D insertions without relying on spatial priors, offering a user-friendly and flexible editing experience.</p></details> |  |

The low rank component coefficients are endowed with a flexible graphical Gaussian Markov random field model. The utilization of a low rank and compactly-supported covariance structure combines the full-scale approximation and the basis graphical lasso; we term this new approach the full-scale basis graphical lasso (FSBGL). Estimation employs a graphical lasso-penalized likelihood, which is optimized using a difference-of-convex scheme. We illustrate the proposed approach with a challenging high-resolution simulation dataset of the thermosphere. In a comparison against state-of-the-art spatial models, the FSBGL performs better at capturing salient features of the thermospheric temperature fields, even with limited available training data.</p></details> | 37 pages, 6 figures |

In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. We identify sets of individuals whose overlap shows a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures plus supplementary information with 12 pages, methods, model and 4 figures of results</p></details> |

However, Transformer-based methods either ignore the spatial neighborhood relationships between the joints when used for skeleton representations or disregard the local temporal patterns of the local joint movements in skeleton sequence modeling, while GCN-based methods often neglect the need for pose-specific representations. To address these problems, we propose a new method that exploits the graph modeling capability of GCN to represent each skeleton with multiple graphs of different orders, incorporated with a newly introduced Graph Order Attention module that dynamically emphasizes the most representative orders for each joint. The resulting spatial features of the sequence are further processed using a proposed temporal Body Aware Transformer that models the global body feature dependencies in the sequence with awareness of the local inter-skeleton feature dependencies of joints. Given that our 3D pose output aligns with the central 2D pose in the sequence, we improve the self-attention mechanism to be aware of the central pose while diminishing its focus gradually towards the first and the last poses. Extensive experiments on Human3.6m, MPIINF-3DHP, and HumanEva-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code and models are made available on Github.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Quasi-Score Matching Estimation for Spatial Autoregressive Model with Random Weights Matrix and Regressors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19721v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancements in technology for data collection, the application of the spatial autoregressive (SAR) model has become increasingly prevalent in real-world analysis, particularly when dealing with large datasets. However, the commonly used quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) for the SAR model is not computationally scalable to handle the data with a large size. In addition, when establishing the asymptotic properties of the parameter estimators of the SAR model, both weights matrix and regressors are assumed to be nonstochastic in classical spatial econometrics, which is perhaps not realistic in real applications. Motivated by the machine learning literature, this paper proposes quasi-score matching estimation for the SAR model. This new estimation approach is developed based on the likelihood, but significantly reduces the computational complexity of the QMLE. The asymptotic properties of parameter estimators under the random weights matrix and regressors are established, which provides a new theoretical framework for the asymptotic inference of the SAR-type models. The usefulness of the quasi-score matching estimation and its asymptotic inference is illustrated via extensive simulation studies and a case study of an anti-conflict social network experiment for middle school students.</p></details> | 35 pages |

Current large multimodal models (LMMs), however, lack of this capability of 3D spatial reasoning. This limitation stems from the scarcity of 3D training data and the bias in current model designs toward 2D data. In this paper, we systematically study the impact of 3D-informed data, architecture, and training setups, introducing SpatialLLM, a large multi-modal model with advanced 3D spatial reasoning abilities. To address data limitations, we develop two types of 3D-informed training datasets: (1) 3D-informed probing data focused on object's 3D location and orientation, and (2) 3D-informed conversation data for complex spatial relationships. Notably, we are the first to curate VQA data that incorporate 3D orientation relationships on real images. Furthermore, we systematically integrate these two types of training data with the architectural and training designs of LMMs, providing a roadmap for optimal design aimed at achieving superior 3D reasoning capabilities. Our SpatialLLM advances machines toward highly capable 3D-informed reasoning, surpassing GPT-4o performance by 8.7%. Our systematic empirical design and the resulting findings offer valuable insights for future research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 highlight, camera ready version</p></details> |

A key objective in spatial analysis is to model spatial relationships and infer spatial processes to generate knowledge from spatial data, which has been largely based on spatial statistical methods. More recently, machine learning offers scalable and flexible approaches that complement traditional methods and has been increasingly applied in spatial data science. Despite its advantages, machine learning is often criticized for being a black box, which limits our understanding of model behavior and output. Recognizing this limitation, XAI has emerged as a pivotal field in AI that provides methods to explain the output of machine learning models to enhance transparency and understanding. These methods are crucial for model diagnosis, bias detection, and ensuring the reliability of results obtained from machine learning models. This chapter introduces key concepts and methods in XAI with a focus on Shapley value-based approaches, which is arguably the most popular XAI method, and their integration with spatial analysis. An empirical example of county-level voting behaviors in the 2020 Presidential election is presented to demonstrate the use of Shapley values and spatial analysis with a comparison to multi-scale geographically weighted regression. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the challenges and limitations of current XAI techniques and proposes new directions.</p></details> |  |

The outputs of such systems vary not only with physical parameters but also with external time-varying input signals. Accurately catching the dynamics of such systems is challenging. We have adapted and extended an existing transformer model for single output prediction to a multiple-output transformer that is able to predict multiple output responses of these systems. The multiple-output transformer generalizes the interpretability of the original transformer. The generalized interpretable attention weight matrix explores not only the temporal correlations in the sequence, but also the interactions between the multiple outputs, providing explanation for the spatial correlation in the output domain. This multiple-output transformer accurately predicts the sequence of multiple outputs, regardless of the nonlinearity of the system and the dimensionality of the parameter space.</p></details> |  |

In many of these cases, the treated and control units correspond to spatial units such as regions or neighborhoods. Our approach addresses the challenge of understanding how an intervention applied at specific locations influences the surrounding area. Traditional synthetic control applications may struggle with defining the effective area of impact, the extent of treatment propagation across space, and the variation of effects with distance from the treatment sites. To address these challenges, we introduce Spatial Vertical Regression (SVR) within the Bayesian paradigm. This innovative approach allows us to accurately predict the outcomes in varying proximities to the treatment sites, while meticulously accounting for the spatial structure inherent in the data. Specifically, rooted on the vertical regression framework of the synthetic control method, SVR employs a Gaussian process to ensure that the imputation of missing potential outcomes for areas of different distance around the treatment sites is spatially coherent, reflecting the expectation that nearby areas experience similar outcomes and have similar relationships to control areas. This approach is particularly pertinent to our study on the Florentine tramway's first line construction. We study its influence on the local commercial landscape, focusing on how business prevalence varies at different distances from the tram stops.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepSTA: A Spatial-Temporal Attention Network for Logistics Delivery Timely Rate Prediction in Anomaly Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00402v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prediction of couriers' delivery timely rates in advance is essential to the logistics industry, enabling companies to take preemptive measures to ensure the normal operation of delivery services. This becomes even more critical during anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers' delivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly. Existing studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many works focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly model abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other features, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous events occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in these scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal attention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we design an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent neural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec to model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks and long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of couriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal circumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a memory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention mechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by 12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over multiple competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2023</p></details> |
| **[A Unified Approach for Multi-Granularity Search over Spatial Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04805v4)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been increased interest in data search as a means to find relevant datasets or data points in data lakes and repositories. Although approaches have been proposed to support spatial dataset search and data point search, they consider the two types of searches independently. To enable search operations ranging from the coarse-grained dataset level to the fine-grained data point level, we provide an integrated one that supports diverse query types and distance metrics. In this paper, we focus on designing a multi-granularity spatial data search system, called Spadas, that supports both dataset and data point search operations. To address the challenges of the high cost of indexing and susceptibility to outliers, we propose a unified index that can drastically improve query efficiency in various scenarios by organizing data reasonably and removing outliers in datasets. Moreover, to accelerate all data search operations, we propose a set of pruning mechanisms based on the unified index, including fast bound estimation, approximation technique with error bound, and pruning in batch techniques, to effectively filter out non-relevant datasets and points. Finally, we report the results of a detailed experimental evaluation using six spatial data repositories, achieving orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrating the effectiveness by case study. An online spatial data search system of Spadas is also implemented and made accessible to users.</p></details> |  |

These observations are commonly streams of RGB images, whose high dimensionality includes substantial task-irrelevant information, requiring large models to extract relevant patterns. In contrast, using more structured observations, such as the spatial poses (positions and orientations) of key objects over time, enables training more compact policies that can recognize relevant patterns with fewer parameters. However, obtaining accurate object poses in open-set, real-world environments remains challenging. For instance, it is impractical to assume that all relevant objects are equipped with markers, and recent learning-based 6D pose estimation and tracking methods often depend on pre-scanned object meshes, requiring manual reconstruction. In this work, we propose PRISM-DP, an approach that leverages segmentation, mesh generation, pose estimation, and pose tracking models to enable compact diffusion policy learning directly from the spatial poses of task-relevant objects. Crucially, because PRISM-DP uses a mesh generation model, it eliminates the need for manual mesh processing or creation, improving scalability and usability in open-set, real-world environments. Experiments across a range of tasks in both simulation and real-world settings show that PRISM-DP outperforms high-dimensional image-based diffusion policies and achieves performance comparable to policies trained with ground-truth state information. We conclude with a discussion of the broader implications and limitations of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Despite long-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and accurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and random shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal Perception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical motion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in an end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to capture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained perception progressively refines the object-level features using previous outputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation. Because there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation, we manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on GasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such as gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, ICIP 2025 Conference</p></details> |

Thus, Wind Power Forecasting (WPF) has been widely recognized as one of the most critical issues in wind power integration and operation. There has been an explosion of studies on wind power forecasting problems in the past decades. Nevertheless, how to well handle the WPF problem is still challenging, since high prediction accuracy is always demanded to ensure grid stability and security of supply. We present a unique Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting dataset: SDWPF, which includes the spatial distribution of wind turbines, as well as the dynamic context factors. Whereas, most of the existing datasets have only a small number of wind turbines without knowing the locations and context information of wind turbines at a fine-grained time scale. By contrast, SDWPF provides the wind power data of 134 wind turbines from a wind farm over half a year with their relative positions and internal statuses. We use this dataset to launch the Baidu KDD Cup 2022 to examine the limit of current WPF solutions.

However, as a foundational model on interactive segmentation, SAM2 performs segmentation directly based on mask memory from the past six frames, leading to two significant challenges. Firstly, during inference in videos, objects may disappear since SAM2 relies solely on memory without accounting for object motion information, which limits its long-range object tracking capabilities. Secondly, its memory is constructed from fixed past frames, making it susceptible to challenges associated with object disappearance or occlusion, due to potentially inaccurate segmentation results in memory. To address these problems, we present MoSAM, incorporating two key strategies to integrate object motion cues into the model and establish more reliable feature memory. Firstly, we propose Motion-Guided Prompting (MGP), which represents the object motion in both sparse and dense manners, then injects them into SAM2 through a set of motion-guided prompts. MGP enables the model to adjust its focus towards the direction of motion, thereby enhancing the object tracking capabilities. Furthermore, acknowledging that past segmentation results may be inaccurate, we devise a Spatial-Temporal Memory Selection (ST-MS) mechanism that dynamically identifies frames likely to contain accurate segmentation in both pixel- and frame-level. By eliminating potentially inaccurate mask predictions from memory, we can leverage more reliable memory features to exploit similar regions for improving segmentation results. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks of video object segmentation and video instance segmentation demonstrate that our MoSAM achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other competitors.</p></details> |  |

However, when operated in the high-recall, low-precision regime required for exhaustive event coverage in soccer analytics, their lack of contextual understanding becomes apparent: many false positives could be resolved by considering a broader sequence of actions and game-state information. In this work, we address this limitation by reasoning at the game level and improving STAD through the addition of a denoising sequence transduction task. Sequences of noisy, context-free player-centric predictions are processed alongside clean game state information using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model. By modeling extended temporal context and reasoning jointly over team-level dynamics, our method leverages the "language of soccer" - its tactical regularities and inter-player dependencies - to generate "denoised" sequences of actions. This approach improves both precision and recall in low-confidence regimes, enabling more reliable event extraction from broadcast video and complementing existing pixel-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, submitted to Advanced Concepts for Intelligent Vision Systems 2025</p></details> |

OFOS platforms offer dynamic allocation incentives to users and merchants through diverse marketing campaigns to encourage payments while maintaining the platforms' budget efficiency. Despite significant progress, the marketing domain continues to face two primary challenges: (i) how to allocate a limited budget with greater efficiency, demanding precision in predicting users' monotonic response (i.e. sensitivity) to incentives, and (ii) ensuring spatio-temporal adaptability and robustness in diverse marketing campaigns across different times and locations. To address these issues, we propose a Constrained Monotonic Adaptive Network (CoMAN) method for spatio-temporal perception within marketing pricing. Specifically, we capture spatio-temporal preferences within attribute features through two foundational spatio-temporal perception modules. To further enhance catching the user sensitivity differentials to incentives across varied times and locations, we design modules for learning spatio-temporal convexity and concavity as well as for expressing sensitivity functions. CoMAN can achieve a more efficient allocation of incentive investments during pricing, thus increasing the conversion rate and orders while maintaining budget efficiency. Extensive offline and online experimental results within our diverse marketing campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while outperforming the monotonic state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Previous approaches for temporal modeling fall into two categories: recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods. The former, while meticulously processing frames one by one, neglect short-term spatio-temporal information redundancies, leading to inefficiencies. The latter naively stack frames sequentially, overlooking the inherent temporal dependencies. In this paper, we re-examine the two dominant temporal modeling approaches within the realm of spatio-temporal predictive learning, offering a unified perspective. Building upon this analysis, we introduce USTEP (Unified Spatio-TEmporal Predictive learning), an innovative framework that reconciles the recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods by integrating both micro-temporal and macro-temporal scales. Extensive experiments on a wide range of spatio-temporal predictive learning demonstrate that USTEP achieves significant improvements over existing temporal modeling approaches, thereby establishing it as a robust solution for a wide range of spatio-temporal applications.</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |

However, most existing learning-based methods for event-based optical flow adopt frame-based techniques, ignoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of events. Additionally, these methods assume linear motion between consecutive events within the loss time window, which increases optical flow errors in long-time sequences. In this work, we observe that rich spatio-temporal information and accurate nonlinear motion between events are crucial for event-based optical flow estimation. Therefore, we propose E-NMSTFlow, a novel unsupervised event-based optical flow network focusing on long-time sequences. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Motion Feature Aware (STMFA) module and an Adaptive Motion Feature Enhancement (AMFE) module, both of which utilize rich spatio-temporal information to learn spatio-temporal data associations. Meanwhile, we propose a nonlinear motion compensation loss that utilizes the accurate nonlinear motion between events to improve the unsupervised learning of our network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Remarkably, our method ranks first among unsupervised learning methods on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets.

Existing solutions often rely on a pre-alignment strategy to normalize data, which can distort intrinsic patterns and escalate computational and memory demands. Addressing these limitations, we introduce STRGCN, a Spatio-Temporal Relational Graph Convolutional Network that avoids pre-alignment and directly captures the complex interdependencies in IMTS by representing them as a fully connected graph. Each observation is represented as a node, allowing the model to effectively handle misaligned timestamps by mapping all inter-node relationships, thus faithfully preserving the asynchronous nature of the data. Moreover, we enhance this model with a hierarchical ``Sandwich'' structure that strategically aggregates nodes to optimize graph embeddings, reducing computational overhead while maintaining detailed local and global context. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that STRGCN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, competitive memory usage and training speed.</p></details> |  |

Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/jegp/nrf</p></details> |

IberFire integrates 260 features across eight main categories: auxiliary features, fire history, geography, topography, meteorology, vegetation indices, human activity, and land cover. All features are derived from open-access sources, ensuring transparency and real-time applicability. The data processing pipeline was implemented entirely using open-source tools, and the codebase has been made publicly available. This work not only enhances spatio-temporal granularity and feature diversity compared to existing European datacubes but also provides a reproducible methodology for constructing similar datasets. IberFire supports advanced wildfire risk modelling through Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, enables climate pattern analysis and informs strategic planning in fire prevention and land management. The dataset is publicly available on Zenodo to promote open research and collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal data fusion of censored threshold exceedances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20268v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data fusion models are widely used in air quality monitoring to integrate in situ and remote-sensing data, offering spatially complete and temporally detailed estimates. However, traditional Gaussian-based models often underestimate extreme pollution values, leading to biased risk assessments. To address this, we present a Bayesian hierarchical data fusion framework rooted in extreme value theory, using the Dirac-delta generalised Pareto distribution to jointly account for threshold and non-threshold exceedances while preserving the temporal structure of extreme events. Our model is used to describe and predict censored threshold exceedances of PM2.5 pollution in the Greater London region by using remote sensing observations from the EAC4 dataset, a reanalysis product from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS), and in situ observation stations from the automatic urban and rural network (AURN) ran by the UK government. Some of our approach's key innovations include combining data with varying spatio-temporal resolutions and fully accounting for parameter uncertainties. Results show that our model outperforms Gaussian-based alternatives and standalone remote-sensing data in predicting threshold exceedances at the majority of observation sites and can even result in improved spatial patterns of PM2.5 pollution than those discernible from the remote-sensing data. Moreover, our approach captures greater variability and spatial patterns, such as higher PM2.5 concentrations near coastal areas, which are not evident in remote-sensing data alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[3DPyranet Features Fusion for Spatio-temporal Feature Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18977v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural network (CNN) slides a kernel over the whole image to produce an output map. This kernel scheme reduces the number of parameters with respect to a fully connected neural network (NN). While CNN has proven to be an effective model in recognition of handwritten characters and traffic signal sign boards, etc. recently, its deep variants have proven to be effective in similar as well as more challenging applications like object, scene and action recognition. Deep CNN add more layers and kernels to the classical CNN, increasing the number of parameters, and partly reducing the main advantage of CNN which is less parameters. In this paper, a 3D pyramidal neural network called 3DPyraNet and a discriminative approach for spatio-temporal feature learning based on it, called 3DPyraNet-F, are proposed. 3DPyraNet introduces a new weighting scheme which learns features from both spatial and temporal dimensions analyzing multiple adjacent frames and keeping a biological plausible structure. It keeps the spatial topology of the input image and presents fewer parameters and lower computational and memory costs compared to both fully connected NNs and recent deep CNNs. 3DPyraNet-F extract the features maps of the highest layer of the learned network, fuse them in a single vector, and provide it as input in such a way to a linear-SVM classifier that enhances the recognition of human actions and dynamic scenes from the videos. Encouraging results are reported with 3DPyraNet in real-world environments, especially in the presence of camera induced motion. Further, 3DPyraNet-F clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art on three benchmark datasets and shows comparable result for the fourth.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often fail to incorporate adequate spatio-temporal modeling and prompt alignment within a unified framework, resulting in temporal inconsistencies, geometric distortions, or low-quality 4D content that deviates from the provided texts. Therefore, we propose STP4D, a novel approach that aims to integrate comprehensive spatio-temporal-prompt consistency modeling for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Specifically, STP4D employs three carefully designed modules: Time-varying Prompt Embedding, Geometric Information Enhancement, and Temporal Extension Deformation, which collaborate to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, STP4D is among the first methods to exploit the Diffusion model to generate 4D Gaussians, combining the fine-grained modeling capabilities and the real-time rendering process of 4DGS with the rapid inference speed of the Diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STP4D excels in generating high-fidelity 4D content with exceptional efficiency (approximately 4.6s per asset), surpassing existing methods in both quality and speed.</p></details> |  |

Multi-sensor synchronous measurement has proven to be more effective for WHAR than using a single sensor. However, existing WHAR methods use shared convolutional kernels for indiscriminate temporal feature extraction across each sensor variable, which fails to effectively capture spatio-temporal relationships of intra-sensor and inter-sensor variables. We propose the DecomposeWHAR model consisting of a decomposition phase and a fusion phase to better model the relationships between modality variables. The decomposition creates high-dimensional representations of each intra-sensor variable through the improved Depth Separable Convolution to capture local temporal features while preserving their unique characteristics. The fusion phase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and fusing their features at both the channel and variable levels. Long-range temporal dependencies are modeled using the State Space Model (SSM), and later cross-sensor interactions are dynamically captured through a self-attention mechanism, highlighting inter-sensor spatial correlations. Our model demonstrates superior performance on three widely used WHAR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 3D segmentation models solely focus on spatial information. To address this gap, we propose OmniMamba4D, a novel segmentation model designed for 4D medical images (3D images over time). OmniMamba4D utilizes a spatio-temporal tetra-orientated Mamba block to effectively capture both spatial and temporal features. Unlike traditional 3D models, which analyze single-time points, OmniMamba4D processes 4D CT data, providing comprehensive spatio-temporal information on lesion progression. Evaluated on an internal dataset comprising of 3,252 CT scans, OmniMamba4D achieves a competitive Dice score of 0.682, comparable to state-of-the-arts (SOTA) models, while maintaining computational efficiency and better detecting disappeared lesions. This work demonstrates a new framework to leverage spatio-temporal information for longitudinal CT lesion segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2025</p></details> |

However, the inherent nonlinearity of the marine dynamic system presents significant challenges. Current forecasting methods mainly include physics-based numerical simulations and data-driven machine learning approaches. The former, while describing SST evolution through differential equations, suffers from high computational complexity and limited applicability, whereas the latter, despite its computational benefits, requires large datasets and faces interpretability challenges. This study presents a prediction framework based solely on data-driven techniques. Using phase space reconstruction, we construct initial-delay attractor pairs with a mathematical homeomorphism and design a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Mapping (STFM) to uncover their intrinsic connections. Unlike conventional models, our method captures SST dynamics efficiently through phase space reconstruction and achieves high prediction accuracy with minimal training data in comparative tests</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures |

However, the low resolution of TIR images, along with tracking interference, significantly limits the perfor-mance of TIR trackers. To address these challenges, we introduce STARS, a novel sparse learning-based CF tracker that incorporates spatio-temporal regulari-zation and super-resolution reconstruction. First, we apply adaptive sparse filter-ing and temporal domain filtering to extract key features of the target while reduc-ing interference from background clutter and noise. Next, we introduce an edge-preserving sparse regularization method to stabilize target features and prevent excessive blurring. This regularization integrates multiple terms and employs the alternating direction method of multipliers to optimize the solution. Finally, we propose a gradient-enhanced super-resolution method to extract fine-grained TIR target features and improve the resolution of TIR images, addressing performance degradation in tracking caused by low-resolution sequences. To the best of our knowledge, STARS is the first to integrate super-resolution methods within a sparse learning-based CF framework. Extensive experiments on the LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR2017 benchmarks demonstrate that STARS outperforms state-of-the-art trackers in terms of robustness.</p></details> |  |

Among EEG techniques, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is favored due to its robust signal-to-noise ratio, minimal training demands, and elevated information transmission rate. Frequency detection in SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces commonly employs canonical correlation analysis (CCA). SSCCA (spatio-spectral canonical correlation analysis) augments CCA by refining spatial filtering. This paper presents a multistage feature fusion methodology for short-duration SSVEP frequency identification, employing SSCCA with template signals derived via leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). A filterbank generates bandpass filters for stimulus frequencies and their harmonics, whereas SSCCA calculates correlation coefficients between subbands and templates. Two phases of non-linear weighting amalgamate these coefficients to discern the target stimulus. This multistage methodology surpasses traditional techniques, attaining a accuracy of 94.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is presented in the Undergraduate Conference on Intelligent Computing and Systems (UCICS 2025) organised by Varendra University, Rajshahi, Bangladesh, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541v3)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, similar to most RGBT fusion tasks, it still mainly relies on manually aligned multimodal image pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Multimodal Spatio-temporal Graph learning Network (MSGNet) for alignment-free RGBT VOD problem by leveraging the robust graph representation learning model. Specifically, we first design an Adaptive Partitioning Layer (APL) to estimate the corresponding regions of the Thermal image within the RGB image (high-resolution), achieving a preliminary inexact alignment. Then, we introduce the Spatial Sparse Graph Learning Module (S-SGLM) which employs a sparse information passing mechanism on the estimated inexact alignment to achieve reliable information interaction between different modalities. Moreover, to fully exploit the temporal cues for RGBT VOD problem, we introduce Hybrid Structured Temporal Modeling (HSTM), which involves a Temporal Sparse Graph Learning Module (T-SGLM) and Temporal Star Block (TSB). T-SGLM aims to filter out some redundant information between adjacent frames by employing the sparse aggregation mechanism on the temporal graph. Meanwhile, TSB is dedicated to achieving the complementary learning of local spatial relationships. Extensive comparative experiments conducted on both the aligned dataset VT-VOD50 and the unaligned dataset UVT-VOD2024 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. Our project will be made available on our website for free public access.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPOT: Spatio-Temporal Pattern Mining and Optimization for Load Consolidation in Freight Transportation Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09680v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Freight consolidation has significant potential to reduce transportation costs and mitigate congestion and pollution. An effective load consolidation plan relies on carefully chosen consolidation points to ensure alignment with existing transportation management processes, such as driver scheduling, personnel planning, and terminal operations. This complexity represents a significant challenge when searching for optimal consolidation strategies. Traditional optimization-based methods provide exact solutions, but their computational complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances and they fail to leverage historical data. Machine learning-based approaches address these issues but often ignore operational constraints, leading to infeasible consolidation plans. This work proposes SPOT, an end-to-end approach that integrates the benefits of machine learning (ML) and optimization for load consolidation. The ML component plays a key role in the planning phase by identifying the consolidation points through spatio-temporal clustering and constrained frequent itemset mining, while the optimization selects the most cost-effective feasible consolidation routes for a given operational day. Extensive experiments conducted on industrial load data demonstrate that SPOT significantly reduces travel distance and transportation costs (by about 50% on large terminals) compared to the existing industry-standard load planning strategy and a neighborhood-based heuristic. Moreover, the ML component provides valuable tactical-level insights by identifying frequently recurring consolidation opportunities that guide proactive planning. In addition, SPOT is computationally efficient and can be easily scaled to accommodate large transportation networks.</p></details> |  |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Joint Conference on Neural Networks(IJCNN), 2015</p></details> |

The key challenge of accurate prediction is how to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and adapt to the inherent dynamics in data. Traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) often struggle with static adjacency matrices that introduce domain bias or learnable matrices that may be overfitting to specific patterns. This challenge becomes more complex when considering Multi-Task Learning (MTL). While MTL has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy through task synergies, it can also face significant hurdles due to task interference. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a novel MTL framework, Dynamic Group-wise Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task Learning (DG-STMTL). DG-STMTL proposes a hybrid adjacency matrix generation module that combines static matrices with dynamic ones through a task-specific gating mechanism. We also introduce a group-wise GCN module to enhance the modelling capability of spatio-temporal dependencies. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate our method. Results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-arts, indicating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and model will be released at https://github.com/Jayce1kk/SpaceVLLM.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> |  |

Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty.

Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.</p></details> | 6 pages |

We would like to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. Thus, we propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address these challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance (in terms of an f-divergence) between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.09482</p></details> |
| **[Towards Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control through Spatio-temporal Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11014v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are integral to intelligent traffic management, fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatio-temporal correlations between multiple intersections.

| **[Decoding Covert Speech from EEG Using a Functional Areas Spatio-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03762v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Covert speech involves imagining speaking without audible sound or any movements. Decoding covert speech from electroencephalogram (EEG) is challenging due to a limited understanding of neural pronunciation mapping and the low signal-to-noise ratio of the signal. In this study, we developed a large-scale multi-utterance speech EEG dataset from 57 right-handed native English-speaking subjects, each performing covert and overt speech tasks by repeating the same word in five utterances within a ten-second duration. Given the spatio-temporal nature of the neural activation process during speech pronunciation, we developed a Functional Areas Spatio-temporal Transformer (FAST), an effective framework for converting EEG signals into tokens and utilizing transformer architecture for sequence encoding. Our results reveal distinct and interpretable speech neural features by the visualization of FAST-generated activation maps across frontal and temporal brain regions with each word being covertly spoken, providing new insights into the discriminative features of the neural representation of covert speech. This is the first report of such a study, which provides interpretable evidence for speech decoding from EEG.

| **[DRAN: A Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network for Spatio-temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01531v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems' states are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. To address non-stationarity frameworks, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, we develop a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module that enables the normalization and de-normalization process in spatio-temporal systems. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state of the art methods in weather prediction and traffic flows forecasting tasks. Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes. Moreover, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of ``data-governance-analytics-decision.'' We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on the ``AGREE'' principles: Automation, Generalization, Robustness, Explainability, and Efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions.

However, the inherently sparse and non-deterministic nature of radar data limits the effectiveness of traditional single-frame BEV paradigms. In this paper, we addresses this limitation by introducing AttentiveGRU, a novel attention-based recurrent approach tailored for radar constraints, which extracts individualized spatio-temporal context for objects by dynamically identifying and fusing temporally correlated structures across present and memory states. By leveraging the consistency of object's latent representation over time, our approach exploits temporal relations to enrich feature representations for both stationary and moving objects, thereby enhancing detection performance and eliminating the need for externally providing or estimating any information about ego vehicle motion. Our experimental results on the public nuScenes dataset show a significant increase in mAP for the car category by 21% over the best radar-only submission. Further evaluations on an additional dataset demonstrate notable improvements in object detection capabilities, underscoring the applicability and effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, SNN possess a crucial characteristic, namely the ability to process spatio-temporal information. However, this ability is constrained by both internal and external factors in practical applications, thereby affecting the performance of SNN. Firstly, the internal issue of SNN lies in the inherent limitations of their network structure and neuronal model, which result in the network adopting a unified processing approach for information of different temporal dimensions when processing input data containing complex temporal information. Secondly, the external issue of SNN stems from the direct encoding method commonly adopted by directly trained SNN, which uses the same feature map for input at each time step, failing to fully exploit the spatio-temporal characteristics of SNN. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Unconstrained Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ULIF) neuronal model that allows for learning different membrane potential parameters at different time steps, thereby enhancing SNN' ability to process information of different temporal dimensions. Additionally, this paper presents a hybrid encoding scheme aimed at solving the problem of direct encoding lacking temporal dimension information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively improve the overall performance of SNN in object detection and object recognition tasks. related code is available at https://github.com/hhx0320/ASNN.</p></details> |  |

Despite its success, existing Mamba-based vision models have overlooked the nuances of event-driven tasks, especially in video reconstruction. Event-based video reconstruction (EBVR) demands spatial translation invariance and close attention to local event relationships in the spatio-temporal domain. Unfortunately, conventional Mamba algorithms apply static window partitions and standard reshape scanning methods, leading to significant losses in local connectivity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EventMamba--a specialized model designed for EBVR tasks. EventMamba innovates by incorporating random window offset (RWO) in the spatial domain, moving away from the restrictive fixed partitioning. Additionally, it features a new consistent traversal serialization approach in the spatio-temporal domain, which maintains the proximity of adjacent events both spatially and temporally. These enhancements enable EventMamba to retain Mamba's robust modeling capabilities while significantly preserving the spatio-temporal locality of event data. Comprehensive testing on multiple datasets shows that EventMamba markedly enhances video reconstruction, drastically improving computation speed while delivering superior visual quality compared to Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniFlow: A Foundation Model for Unified Urban Spatio-Temporal Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12972v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal flow prediction, encompassing traffic flows and crowd flows, is crucial for optimizing city infrastructure and managing traffic and emergency responses. Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability.

The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.</p></details> |  |

Built upon the powerful Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, JavisDiT is able to generate high-quality audio and video content simultaneously from open-ended user prompts. To ensure optimal synchronization, we introduce a fine-grained spatio-temporal alignment mechanism through a Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Synchronized Prior (HiST-Sypo) Estimator. This module extracts both global and fine-grained spatio-temporal priors, guiding the synchronization between the visual and auditory components. Furthermore, we propose a new benchmark, JavisBench, consisting of 10,140 high-quality text-captioned sounding videos spanning diverse scenes and complex real-world scenarios. Further, we specifically devise a robust metric for evaluating the synchronization between generated audio-video pairs in real-world complex content. Experimental results demonstrate that JavisDiT significantly outperforms existing methods by ensuring both high-quality generation and precise synchronization, setting a new standard for JAVG tasks.

However, existing multi-sensor fusion research predominantly integrates complementary context from multiple images rather than videos. This primarily stems from two factors: 1) the scarcity of large-scale multi-sensor video datasets, limiting research in video fusion, and 2) the inherent difficulty of jointly modeling spatial and temporal dependencies in a unified framework. This paper proactively compensates for the dilemmas. First, we construct M3SVD, a benchmark dataset with $220$ temporally synchronized and spatially registered infrared-visible video pairs comprising 153,797 frames, filling the data gap for the video fusion community. Secondly, we propose VideoFusion, a multi-modal video fusion model that fully exploits cross-modal complementarity and temporal dynamics to generate spatio-temporally coherent videos from (potentially degraded) multi-modal inputs. Specifically, 1) a differential reinforcement module is developed for cross-modal information interaction and enhancement, 2) a complete modality-guided fusion strategy is employed to adaptively integrate multi-modal features, and 3) a bi-temporal co-attention mechanism is devised to dynamically aggregate forward-backward temporal contexts to reinforce cross-frame feature representations. Extensive experiments reveal that VideoFusion outperforms existing image-oriented fusion paradigms in sequential scenarios, effectively mitigating temporal inconsistency and interference.</p></details> |  |

VT migration is an effective way that migrates the VT when the locations of physical entities keep changing to maintain seamless immersive VT services. However, an efficient VT migration is challenging due to the rapid movement of vehicles, dynamic workloads of Roadside Units (RSUs), and heterogeneous resources of the RSUs. To achieve efficient migration decisions and a minimum latency for the VT migration, we propose a multi-agent split Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework combined with spatio-temporal trajectory generation. In this framework, multiple split DRL agents utilize split architecture to efficiently determine VT migration decisions. Furthermore, we propose a spatio-temporal trajectory generation algorithm based on trajectory datasets and road network data to simulate vehicle trajectories, enhancing the generalization of the proposed scheme for managing VT migration in dynamic network environments. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only enhances the Quality of Experience (QoE) by 29% but also reduces the computational parameter count by approximately 25% while maintaining similar performances, enhancing users' immersive experiences in vehicular metaverses.</p></details> |  |

Our approach combines Bayesian Structural Time Series for modeling marginal crop yields, ensuring a more robust quantification of uncertainty given the typically short historical records. To capture dynamic dependencies between regions, we develop a time-varying conditional copula model, where the copula parameter evolves over time as a function of its previous lag and extreme weather covariates. Unlike traditional approaches that treat climatic factors as fixed inputs, we incorporate dynamic Generalized Extreme Value models to characterize extreme weather events, enabling a more accurate reflection of their impact on crop yields. Furthermore, to ensure scalability for large-scale applications, we build on the existing Partitioning Around Medoids clustering algorithm and introduce a novel dissimilarity measure that integrates both spatial and copula-based dependence, enabling an effective reduction of the dimensionality in the dependence structure.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches face a trilemma: diffusion-based methods achieve high visual fidelity but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while GAN-based solutions sacrifice lip-sync accuracy or dental details for real-time performance. We present MuseTalk, a novel two-stage training framework that resolves this trade-off through latent space optimization and spatio-temporal data sampling strategy. Our key innovations include: (1) During the Facial Abstract Pretraining stage, we propose Informative Frame Sampling to temporally align reference-source pose pairs, eliminating redundant feature interference while preserving identity cues. (2) In the Lip-Sync Adversarial Finetuning stage, we employ Dynamic Margin Sampling to spatially select the most suitable lip-movement-promoting regions, balancing audio-visual synchronization and dental clarity. (3) MuseTalk establishes an effective audio-visual feature fusion framework in the latent space, delivering 30 FPS output at 256*256 resolution on an NVIDIA V100 GPU. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MuseTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity while achieving comparable lip-sync accuracy. %The codes and models will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Recent advances have improved the spatial reasoning ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing large-scale data, but these models still struggle to analyze kinematic elements like traveled distance and speed of moving objects. To bridge this gap, we construct a spatio-temporal reasoning dataset and benchmark involving kinematic instruction tuning, referred to as STKit and STKit-Bench. They consist of real-world videos with 3D annotations, detailing object motion dynamics: traveled distance, speed, movement direction, inter-object distance comparisons, and relative movement direction. To further scale such data construction to videos without 3D labels, we propose an automatic pipeline to generate pseudo-labels using 4D reconstruction in real-world scale. With our kinematic instruction tuning data for spatio-temporal reasoning, we present ST-VLM, a VLM enhanced for spatio-temporal reasoning, which exhibits outstanding performance on STKit-Bench. Furthermore, we show that ST-VLM generalizes robustly across diverse domains and tasks, outperforming baselines on other spatio-temporal benchmarks (eg, ActivityNet, TVQA+). Finally, by integrating learned spatio-temporal reasoning with existing abilities, ST-VLM enables complex multi-step reasoning. Project page: https://ikodoh.github.io/ST-VLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unbiased and Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Anticipation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13059v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Scene Graphs (STSGs) provide a concise and expressive representation of dynamic scenes by modeling objects and their evolving relationships over time. However, real-world visual relationships often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, causing existing methods for tasks like Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) and Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) to produce biased scene graphs. To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages loss masking and curriculum learning to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Unlike prior methods that add extra architectural components to learn unbiased estimators, we propose an impartial training objective that reduces the dominance of head classes during learning and focuses on underrepresented tail relationships. Our curriculum-driven mask generation strategy further empowers the model to adaptively adjust its bias mitigation strategy over time, enabling more balanced and robust estimations. To thoroughly assess performance under various distribution shifts, we also introduce two new tasks Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation offering a challenging benchmark for evaluating the resilience of STSG models. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate the superior unbiased performance and robustness of our method compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Compared to its predecessor SV4D, SV4D 2.0 is more robust to occlusions and large motion, generalizes better to real-world videos, and produces higher-quality outputs in terms of detail sharpness and spatio-temporal consistency. We achieve this by introducing key improvements in multiple aspects: 1) network architecture: eliminating the dependency of reference multi-views and designing blending mechanism for 3D and frame attention, 2) data: enhancing quality and quantity of training data, 3) training strategy: adopting progressive 3D-4D training for better generalization, and 4) 4D optimization: handling 3D inconsistency and large motion via 2-stage refinement and progressive frame sampling.

However, relation modeling between different image patches exhibits significant variations. For instance, background regions dominated by target-irrelevant information require reduced attention allocation, while foreground, particularly boundary areas, need to be be emphasized. A single model may not effectively handle all kinds of relation modeling simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel tracker called SPMTrack based on mixture-of-experts tailored for visual tracking task (TMoE), combining the capability of multiple experts to handle diverse relation modeling more flexibly. Benefiting from TMoE, we extend relation modeling from image pairs to spatio-temporal context, further improving tracking accuracy with minimal increase in model parameters. Moreover, we employ TMoE as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, substantially reducing trainable parameters, which enables us to train SPMTrack of varying scales efficiently and preserve the generalization ability of pretrained models to achieve superior performance. We conduct experiments on seven datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers.

Despite its importance, conventional LVEF estimation remains time-consuming and operator-dependent. Recent deep learning advancements have enhanced automation, yet many existing models are computationally demanding, hindering their feasibility for real-time clinical applications. Additionally, the interplay between spatial and temporal features is crucial for accurate estimation but is often overlooked. In this work, we propose Echo-E$^3$Net, an efficient Endo-Epi spatio-temporal network tailored for LVEF estimation. Our method introduces the Endo-Epi Cardial Border Detector (E$^2$CBD) module, which enhances feature extraction by leveraging spatial and temporal landmark cues. Complementing this, the Endo-Epi Feature Aggregator (E$^2$FA) distills statistical descriptors from backbone feature maps, refining the final EF prediction. These modules, along with a multi-component loss function tailored to align with the clinical definition of EF, collectively enhance spatial-temporal representation learning, ensuring robust and efficient EF estimation. We evaluate Echo-E$^3$Net on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, achieving a RMSE of 5.15 and an R$^2$ score of 0.82, setting a new benchmark in efficiency with 6.8 million parameters and only 8.49G Flops.

While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Predictors in the Presence of Missing and Heterogeneous Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01701v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning approaches achieve outstanding predictive performance in modeling modern data, despite the increasing complexity and scale. However, evaluating the quality of predictive models becomes more challenging, as traditional statistical assumptions often no longer hold. In particular, spatio-temporal data exhibit dependencies across both time and space, often involving nonlinear dynamics, non-stationarities, and missing observations. As a result, advanced predictors such as spatio-temporal graph neural networks require novel evaluation methodologies. This paper introduces a residual correlation analysis framework designed to assess the optimality of spatio-temporal predictive neural models, particularly in scenarios with incomplete and heterogeneous data. By leveraging the principle that residual correlation indicates information not captured by the model, this framework serves as a powerful tool to identify and localize regions in space and time where model performance can be improved. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to operate under minimal assumptions, enabling robust evaluation of deep learning models applied to multivariate time series, even in the presence of missing and heterogeneous data. The methodology employs tailored spatio-temporal graphs to encode sparse spatial and temporal dependencies within the data and utilizes asymptotically distribution-free summary statistics to pinpoint time intervals and spatial regions where the model underperforms. The effectiveness of the proposed residual analysis is demonstrated through validation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios involving state-of-the-art predictive models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Copula-based spatio-temporal modeling of air pollutant data incorporating covariate dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15935v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elevated levels of PM10 are known to cause severe respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and, in extreme cases, cancer and mortality. Despite various reduction policies implemented across different sectors, PM10 concentrations in South Korea continue to exceed the annual recommended limits set by the World Health Organization. Spatio-temporal PM10 concentrations may exhibit both spatial and temporal dependencies. Additionally, interactions between PM10 and environmental factors can further influence the variability in PM10. Therefore, this study proposes a method that incorporates the spatio-temporal neighbors of covariates alongside those of PM10 by adopting an approach that explains spatio-temporal interactions through spatio-temporal neighbors. Vine copulas are used to integrate the pairwise dependence structures between a given location and its surrounding spatio-temporal neighbors. We applied the model to weekly average PM10 data from South Korea in 2019, using PM2.5 and CO as covariates. Given that all three variables exhibited skewness, we assumed the Gumbel and Generalized Extreme Value distributions as marginal distributions. The proposed model outperformed a traditional Bayesian spatio-temporal model, a kriging method, and an alternative copula-based approach, particularly in predicting the top 5% of extreme values, by effectively capturing tail dependencies crucial for extreme value analysis. This study highlights the importance of utilizing vine copulas to effectively model diverse dependency structures in spatio-temporal data while simultaneously accommodating spatial and temporal dimensions, including spatio-temporal dependencies among covariates. The results underscore the broader applicability of the proposed approach to other fields where complex dependency structures are present.</p></details> |  |

However, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) continue to encounter challenges related to low inference speed, primarily due to the iterative denoising process. To address this issue, we propose BlockDance, a training-free approach that explores feature similarities at adjacent time steps to accelerate DiTs. Unlike previous feature-reuse methods that lack tailored reuse strategies for features at different scales, BlockDance prioritizes the identification of the most structurally similar features, referred to as Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal (STSS) features. These features are primarily located within the structure-focused blocks of the transformer during the later stages of denoising. BlockDance caches and reuses these highly similar features to mitigate redundant computation, thereby accelerating DiTs while maximizing consistency with the generated results of the original model. Furthermore, considering the diversity of generated content and the varying distributions of redundant features, we introduce BlockDance-Ada, a lightweight decision-making network tailored for instance-specific acceleration. BlockDance-Ada dynamically allocates resources and provides superior content quality. Both BlockDance and BlockDance-Ada have proven effective across various generation tasks and models, achieving accelerations between 25% and 50% while maintaining generation quality.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

However, these models do not fully capture the complexity of the language learning process of an infant when used in isolation. In this paper, we examine how a model of language acquisition for infants and young children can be constructed and adapted for use in a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN), taking into account the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during child language learning. We introduce a novel approach for predicting child vocabulary acquisition, and evaluate the efficacy of such a model with respect to the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during language acquisition, resulting in insightful observations on model calibration and norm selection. An evaluation of this model found that the mean accuracy of models for predicting new words when using sensorimotor relationships (0.733) and semantic relationships (0.729) were found to be superior to that observed with a 2-layer Feed-forward neural network. Furthermore, the high recall for some relationships suggested that some relationships (e.g. visual) were superior in identifying a larger proportion of relevant words that a child should subsequently learn than others (such as auditory).</p></details> |  |

In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain.</p></details> |  |

However, restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to low-resolution ODVs. Video super-resolution (SR) is proposed to enhance resolution, but practical ODV spatial projection distortions and temporal flickering are not well addressed directly applying existing methods. To achieve better ODV-SR reconstruction, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatially continuous distortion modulation module is introduced to improve discrete projection distortions. Next, we design an interlaced multi-frame reconstruction mechanism to refine temporal consistency across frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive weights during training to concentrate on regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. In general, we explore inference-free and real-world viewing matched strategies to provide an application-friendly method on a novel ODV-SR dataset with practical scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed STDAN over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Centric Video Anomaly Detection Through Spatio-Temporal Pose Tokenization and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15185v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly due to the unpredictable and infrequent nature of anomalous events, coupled with the diverse and dynamic environments in which they occur. Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce SPARTA, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. SPARTA introduces an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion over time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism captures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than focusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further emphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's core, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches, including spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs), often face high memory demands and struggle to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies, limiting their efficiency in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce DynSTG-Mamba (Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Mamba), a novel framework that combines DF-STGNN and STG-Mamba to enhance motion sequence modeling. The DF-STGNN incorporates a dynamic spatio-temporal filter that adaptively adjusts spatial connections between skeletal joints and temporal interactions across different movement phases. This approach ensures better feature propagation through dynamic graph structures by considering the hierarchical nature and dynamics of skeletal gait data. Meanwhile, STG-Mamba, an extension of Mamba adapted for skeletal motion data, ensures a continuous propagation of states, facilitating the capture of long-term dependencies while reducing computational complexity. To reduce the number of model parameters and computational costs while maintaining consistency, we propose Cross-Graph Relational Knowledge Distillation, a novel knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns relational information between teacher (large architecture) and student models (small architecture) while using shared memory. This ensures that the interactions and movement patterns of the joints are accurately preserved in the motion sequences. We validate our DynSTG-Mamba on KOA-NM, PD-WALK, and ATAXIA datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and Recall. Our results highlight the efficiency and robustness of our approach, offering a lightweight yet highly accurate solution for automated gait analysis and movement disorder assessment.</p></details> |  |

Our approach applies query-based detection (DETR) to each frame and matches DETR queries to link the same person across frames. We introduce the Query Matching Module (QMM), which uses metric learning to bring queries for the same person closer together across frames compared to queries for different people. Action classes are predicted using the sequence of queries obtained from QMM matching, allowing for variable-length inputs from videos longer than a single clip. Experimental results on JHMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets demonstrate that our method performs well for large position changes of people while offering superior computational efficiency and lower resource requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended version of VISAPP2025</p></details> |

Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

| **[Spatio-temporal Fourier Transformer (StFT) for Long-term Dynamics Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11899v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating the long-term dynamics of multi-scale and multi-physics systems poses a significant challenge in understanding complex phenomena across science and engineering. The complexity arises from the intricate interactions between scales and the interplay of diverse physical processes. Neural operators have emerged as promising models for predicting such dynamics due to their flexibility and computational efficiency. However, they often fail to effectively capture multi-scale interactions or quantify the uncertainties inherent in the predictions. These limitations lead to rapid error accumulation, particularly in long-term forecasting of systems characterized by complex and coupled dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a spatio-temporal Fourier transformer (StFT), in which each transformer block is designed to learn dynamics at a specific scale. By leveraging a structured hierarchy of StFT blocks, the model explicitly captures dynamics across both macro- and micro- spatial scales. Furthermore, a generative residual correction mechanism is integrated to estimate and mitigate predictive uncertainties, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of long-term forecasts. Evaluations conducted on three benchmark datasets (plasma, fluid, and atmospheric dynamics) demonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art ML methods.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

However, can Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) also "reason through a sequential spatio-temporal logic" in videos? Existing Video-LLM benchmarks primarily focus on assessing object presence, neglecting relational reasoning. Consequently, it is difficult to measure whether a model truly comprehends object interactions (actions/events) in videos or merely relies on pre-trained "memory" of co-occurrences as biases in generating answers. In this work, we introduce a Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (V-STaR) benchmark to address these shortcomings. The key idea is to decompose video understanding into a Reverse Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (RSTR) task that simultaneously evaluates what objects are present, when events occur, and where they are located while capturing the underlying Chain-of-thought (CoT) logic. To support this evaluation, we construct a dataset to elicit the spatial-temporal reasoning process of Video-LLMs. It contains coarse-to-fine CoT questions generated by a semi-automated GPT-4-powered pipeline, embedding explicit reasoning chains to mimic human cognition. Experiments from 14 Video-LLMs on our V-STaR reveal significant gaps between current Video-LLMs and the needs for robust and consistent spatio-temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ben...</summary><p>A benchmark for Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning</p></details> |

Nevertheless, conventional Mamba-based models encounter significant challenges in accurately predicting stock time series, as they fail to adequately capture both the overarching market dynamics and the intricate interdependencies among individual stocks. To overcome these constraints, we introduce the Hierarchical Information-Guided Spatio-Temporal Mamba (HIGSTM) framework. HIGSTM introduces Index-Guided Frequency Filtering Decomposition to extract commonality and specificity from time series. The model architecture features a meticulously designed hierarchical framework that systematically captures both temporal dynamic patterns and global static relationships within the stock market. Furthermore, we propose an Information-Guided Mamba that integrates macro informations into the sequence selection process, thereby facilitating more market-conscious decision-making. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on the CSI500, CSI800 and CSI1000 datasets demonstrate that HIGSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods struggle with low signal-to-noise ratios and single-station reliance, limiting their effectiveness. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) using Spectral Structure Learning Convolution (Spectral SLC) to model static and dynamic relationships across seismic stations. Our approach processes multi-station waveform data and generates station-specific detection probabilities. Experiments show superior performance over a conventional GCN baseline in terms of true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR), highlighting its potential for robust multi-station earthquake detection.

Prior work primarily focuses on single-frame cooperative perception, which fuses agents' information across different spatial locations but ignores temporal cues and temporal tasks (e.g., temporal perception and prediction). In this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal fusion in V2X scenarios and design one-step and multi-step communication strategies (when to transmit) as well as examine their integration with three fusion strategies - early, late, and intermediate (what to transmit), providing comprehensive benchmarks with 11 fusion models (how to fuse). Furthermore, we propose V2XPnP, a novel intermediate fusion framework within one-step communication for end-to-end perception and prediction. Our framework employs a unified Transformer-based architecture to effectively model complex spatio-temporal relationships across multiple agents, frames, and high-definition map. Moreover, we introduce the V2XPnP Sequential Dataset that supports all V2X collaboration modes and addresses the limitations of existing real-world datasets, which are restricted to single-frame or single-mode cooperation. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perception and prediction tasks. The codebase and dataset will be released to facilitate future V2X research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website link: https://mobility-lab.seas.ucla.edu/v2xpnp/</p></details> |

Compared to classic STVG locating only a single target, OmniSTVG enables localization of not only an arbitrary number of text-referred targets but also their interacting counterparts in the query from the video, making it more flexible and practical in real scenarios for comprehensive understanding. In order to facilitate exploration of OmniSTVG, we introduce BOSTVG, a large-scale benchmark dedicated to OmniSTVG. Specifically, our BOSTVG consists of 10,018 videos with 10.2M frames and covers a wide selection of 287 classes from diverse scenarios. Each sequence in BOSTVG, paired with a free-form textual query, encompasses a varying number of targets ranging from 1 to 10. To ensure high quality, each video is manually annotated with meticulous inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, BOSTVG is to date the first and the largest benchmark for OmniSTVG. To encourage future research, we introduce a simple yet effective approach, named OmniTube, which, drawing inspiration from Transformer-based STVG methods, is specially designed for OmniSTVG and demonstrates promising results. By releasing BOSTVG, we hope to go beyond classic STVG by locating every object appearing in the query for more comprehensive understanding, opening up a new direction for STVG. Our benchmark, model, and results will be released at https://github.com/JellyYao3000/OmniSTVG.</p></details> |  |

Traditional deep learning approaches have significantly advanced this field, particularly in the stage of ST data mining. However, these models remain task-specific and often require extensive labeled data. Inspired by the success of Foundation Models (FM), especially large language models, researchers have begun exploring the concept of Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models (STFMs) to enhance adaptability and generalization across diverse ST tasks. Unlike prior architectures, STFMs empower the entire workflow of ST data science, ranging from data sensing, management, to mining, thereby offering a more holistic and scalable approach. Despite rapid progress, a systematic study of STFMs for ST data science remains lacking. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of STFMs, categorizing existing methodologies and identifying key research directions to advance ST general intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing existing observations, spatio-temporal kriging is a method for estimating air quality at unobserved locations during a specific period. Inductive spatio-temporal kriging with increment training strategy has demonstrated its effectiveness using virtual nodes to simulate unobserved nodes. However, a disparity between virtual and real nodes persists, complicating the application of learning patterns derived from virtual nodes to actual unobserved ones. To address these limitations, this paper presents a Physics-Guided Increment Training Strategy (PGITS). Specifically, we design a dynamic graph generation module to incorporate the advection and diffusion processes of airborne particles as physical knowledge into the graph structure, dynamically adjusting the adjacency matrix to reflect physical interactions between nodes. By using physics principles as a bridge between virtual and real nodes, this strategy ensures the features of virtual nodes and their pseudo labels are closer to actual nodes. Consequently, the learned patterns of virtual nodes can be applied to actual unobserved nodes for effective kriging.</p></details> |  |

Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been ACCEPTED as a FULL PAPER at DASFAA 2025</p></details> |

As systems like autonomous driving become increasingly popular, ensuring their safety has become more important than ever. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to quickly and effectively detect various anomalies in the aforementioned systems, with the goal of making them safer and more effective. Many detection systems have been developed with great success under spatial contexts; however, there is still significant room for improvement when it comes to temporal context. While there is substantial work regarding this task, there is minimal work done regarding the efficiency of models and their ability to be applied to scenarios that require real-time inference, i.e., autonomous driving where anomalies need to be detected the moment they are within view. To address this gap, we propose STEAD (Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection), whose backbone is developed using (2+1)D Convolutions and Performer Linear Attention, which ensures computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. When tested on the UCF-Crime benchmark, our base model achieves an AUC of 91.34%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art, and our fast version achieves an AUC of 88.87%, while having 99.70% less parameters and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art as well.

Deep Learning (DL), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), have revolutionized this field by enhancing the accuracy of classification tasks. In this work, a novel approach combining a transformer-based Swin-Unet architecture with seasonal synthesized spatio-temporal images has been employed to classify LC types using spatio-temporal features extracted from Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, organized into seasonal clusters. The study focuses on three distinct regions - Amazonia, Africa, and Siberia - and evaluates the model performance across diverse ecoregions within these areas. By utilizing seasonal feature sequences instead of dense temporal sequences, notable performance improvements have been achieved, especially in regions with temporal data gaps like Siberia, where S1 data distribution is uneven and non-uniform.

| **[Temporal Reversal Regularization for Spiking Neural Networks: Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Invariance for Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low power computing paradigm. Recent studies have shown that SNNs suffer from severe overfitting, which limits their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Temporal Reversal Regularization (TRR) to mitigate overfitting during training and facilitate generalization of SNNs. We exploit the inherent temporal properties of SNNs to perform input/feature temporal reversal perturbations, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and learn perturbation-invariant representations. To further enhance generalization, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (Hadamard product) for feature hybridization of original and temporally reversed spike firing rates, which expands the implicit dimensionality and acts as a spatio-temporal regularizer. We show theoretically that our method is able to tighten the upper bound of the generalization error, and extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic recognition as well as 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate its effectiveness, versatility, and adversarial robustness. In particular, our regularization significantly improves the recognition accuracy of low-latency SNN for neuromorphic objects, contributing to the real-world deployment of neuromorphic computational software-hardware integration.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DropletVideo: A Dataset and Approach to Explore Integral Spatio-Temporal Consistent Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06053v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal consistency is a critical research topic in video generation. A qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence while maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying viewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily focuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination, such as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without constraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may introduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby overlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with numerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes increasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral spatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression and camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent generation. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the development of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset, which comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object actions.

However, understanding the predictions from a model is crucial to ensure reliability and trustworthiness, particularly for high-risk applications, such as healthcare and transport. Few existing methods are able to generate explanations for models trained on continuous-time dynamic graph data and, of these, the computational complexity and lack of suitable explanation objectives pose challenges. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{S}$patio-$\textbf{T}$emporal E$\textbf{X}$planation $\textbf{Search}$ (STX-Search), a novel method for generating instance-level explanations that is applicable to static and dynamic temporal graph structures. We introduce a novel search strategy and objective function, to find explanations that are highly faithful and interpretable. When compared with existing methods, STX-Search produces explanations of higher fidelity whilst optimising explanation size to maintain interpretability.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we apply these spatio-temporal compressors to standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed prime-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the versatility of the proposed spatio-temporal compressors and verify the convergence of algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |

State-of-the-art association methods in agriculture are dedicated towards matching larger crops using either high-resolution point clouds or temporally stable features, which are both difficult to obtain for smaller fruit in the field. To address these challenges, we propose a transformer-based architecture that encodes the shape and position of each fruitlet, and propagates and refines these features through a series of transformer encoder layers with alternating self and cross-attention. We demonstrate that our method is able to achieve an F1-score of 92.4% on data collected in a commercial apple orchard and outperforms all baselines and ablations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07517v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. A computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism has recently been shown to exhibit superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. Our investigation reveals significant challenges related to stability and parameterization when employing the conventional Euler-Forward discretization for this class of models. We report a rigorous theoretical and empirical demonstration that these challenges can be effectively addressed by adopting an alternative discretization approach - the Symplectic Euler method, allowing to improve over state-of-the-art performances on common event-based benchmark datasets. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences without any normalization techniques.</p></details> |  |

Here we present new generally applicable methodology to perform this task. We introduce a parsimonious representation of seasonality and a biologically informed specification of the outbreak component to avoid parameter identifiability issues. We develop a computationally efficient Bayesian inference methodology for the proposed models, including techniques to detect outbreaks by computing marginal posterior probabilities at each spatial location and time point. We show that it is possible to efficiently integrate out the discrete parameters associated with outbreak states, enabling the use of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) as a complementary alternative to a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce a robust Bayesian model comparison framework based on importance sampling to approximate model evidence in high-dimensional space. The performance of our methodology is validated through systematic simulation studies, where simulated outbreaks were successfully detected, and our model comparison strategy demonstrates strong reliability. We also apply our new methodology to monthly incidence data on invasive meningococcal disease from 28 European countries. The results highlight outbreaks across multiple countries and months, with model comparison analysis showing that the new specification outperforms previous approaches.

To achieve this goal, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Memory Agent (STMA), a novel framework designed to enhance task planning and execution by integrating spatio-temporal memory. STMA is built upon three critical components: (1) a spatio-temporal memory module that captures historical and environmental changes in real time, (2) a dynamic knowledge graph that facilitates adaptive spatial reasoning, and (3) a planner-critic mechanism that iteratively refines task strategies. We evaluate STMA in the TextWorld environment on 32 tasks, involving multi-step planning and exploration under varying levels of complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that STMA achieves a 31.25% improvement in success rate and a 24.7% increase in average score compared to the state-of-the-art model. The results highlight the effectiveness of spatio-temporal memory in advancing the memory capabilities of embodied agents.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we explore automated pain detection using facial expressions. Our study leverages deep learning techniques to improve pain assessment by analyzing facial images from the Pain Emotion Faces Database (PEMF). We propose two novel approaches1: (1) a hybrid ConvNeXt model combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) blocks to analyze video frames and predict pain presence, and (2) a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (STGCN) integrated with LSTM to process landmarks from facial images for pain detection. Our work represents the first use of the PEMF dataset for binary pain classification and demonstrates the effectiveness of these models through extensive experimentation. The results highlight the potential of combining spatial and temporal features for enhanced pain detection, offering a promising advancement in objective pain assessment methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

To address these limitations, this paper presents the Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer framework (STGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation in videos. First, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal criss-cross Graph (STG) attention mechanism, designed to more effectively leverage the inherent graph priors of the human body within continuous sequence distributions while capturing spatiotemporal long-range dependencies. Next, we present a dual-path Modulated Hop-wise Regular GCN (MHR-GCN) to independently process temporal and spatial dimensions in parallel, preserving features rich in temporal dynamics and the original or high-dimensional representations of spatial structures. Furthermore, the module leverages modulation to optimize parameter efficiency and incorporates spatiotemporal hop-wise skip connections to capture higher-order information. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPIINF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[H-FLTN: A Privacy-Preserving Hierarchical Framework for Electric Vehicle Spatio-Temporal Charge Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18697v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) poses critical challenges for energy providers, particularly in predicting charging time (temporal prediction), ensuring user privacy, and managing resources efficiently in mobility-driven networks. This paper introduces the Hierarchical Federated Learning Transformer Network (H-FLTN) framework to address these challenges. H-FLTN employs a three-tier hierarchical architecture comprising EVs, community Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS), and the Energy Provider Data Centre (EPDC) to enable accurate spatio-temporal predictions of EV charging needs while preserving privacy. Temporal prediction is enhanced using Transformer-based learning, capturing complex dependencies in charging behavior. Privacy is ensured through Secure Aggregation, Additive Secret Sharing, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Sharing with Augmentation, which allow only secret shares of model weights to be exchanged while securing all transmissions. To improve training efficiency and resource management, H-FLTN integrates Dynamic Client Capping Mechanism (DCCM) and Client Rotation Management (CRM), ensuring that training remains both computationally and temporally efficient as the number of participating EVs increases. DCCM optimises client participation by limiting excessive computational loads, while CRM balances training contributions across epochs, preventing imbalanced participation. Our simulation results based on large-scale empirical vehicle mobility data reveal that DCCM and CRM reduce the training time complexity with increasing EVs from linear to constant. Its integration into real-world smart city infrastructure enhances energy demand forecasting, resource allocation, and grid stability, ensuring reliability and sustainability in future mobility ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 tables, 2 figures, Journal Paper</p></details> |

Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against 11 baselines.</p></details> |  |

The objective is to provide a quality score to ensure correct performance and achieve desired results. To achieve this goal, a new graph-based model, the Dense Spatio-Temporal Graph Conv-GRU Network with Transformer, is introduced. This model combines a modified version of STGCN and transformer architectures for efficient handling of spatio-temporal data. The key idea is to consider skeleton data respecting its non-linear structure as a graph and detecting joints playing the main role in each rehabilitation exercise. Dense connections and GRU mechanisms are used to rapidly process large 3D skeleton inputs and effectively model temporal dynamics. The transformer encoder's attention mechanism focuses on relevant parts of the input sequence, making it useful for evaluating rehabilitation exercises. The evaluation of our proposed approach on the KIMORE and UI-PRMD datasets highlighted its potential, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational time. This resulted in faster and more accurate learning and assessment of rehabilitation exercises. Additionally, our model provides valuable feedback through qualitative illustrations, effectively highlighting the significance of joints in specific exercises.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, Computers in Biology and Medicine Journal</p></details> |

However, traditional approaches to assess patient actions often rely on manual observation and scoring, which are subjective and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for patient action assessment using a Multi-Residual Spatio Temporal Graph Network (MR-STGN) that incorporates both angular and positional 3D skeletons. The MR-STGN is specifically designed to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of patient actions. It achieves this by integrating information from multiple residual layers, with each layer extracting features at distinct levels of abstraction. Furthermore, we integrate an attention fusion mechanism into the network, which facilitates the adaptive weighting of various features. This empowers the model to concentrate on the most pertinent aspects of the patient's movements, offering precise instructions regarding specific body parts or movements that require attention. Ablation studies are conducted to analyze the impact of individual components within the proposed model. We evaluate our model on the UI-PRMD dataset demonstrating its performance in accurately predicting real-time patient action scores, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely available scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would become significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on plain CNNs that fail to capture cross-channel time-frequency cues or on heavy transformer/GAN decoders that strain memory and stability. We propose Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight spectrogram-to-volume generator that confronts these issues via a Multi-directional Time-Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder, stacking temporal, spectral and joint convolutions with self-attention, and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder whose linear-time state-space blocks enable efficient long-range spatial modelling. Trained end-to-end with a hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on three public benchmarks, recording SSIMs of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9% respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves competitive PSNR scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a 4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in reconstruction quality. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings. The code is available at https://github.com/hdy6438/Spec2VolCAMU-Net.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enumerating Graphlets with Amortized Time Complexity Independent of Graph Size](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13613v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphlets of order $k$ in a graph $G$ are connected subgraphs induced by $k$ nodes (called $k$-graphlets) or by $k$ edges (called edge $k$-graphlets). They are among the interesting subgraphs in network analysis to get insights on both the local and global structure of a network. While several algorithms exist for discovering and enumerating graphlets, the cost per solution of such algorithms typically depends on the size of the graph $G$, or its maximum degree. In real networks, even the latter can be in the order of millions, whereas $k$ is typically required to be a small value. In this paper we provide the first algorithm to list all graphlets of order $k$ in a graph $G=(V,E)$ with an amortized cost per solution depending \emph{solely} on the order $k$, contrarily to previous approaches where the cost depends \emph{also} on the size of $G$ or its maximum degree. Specifically, we show that it is possible to list $k$-graphlets in $O(k^2)$ time per solution, and to list edge $k$-graphlets in $O(k)$ time per solution. Furthermore we show that, if the input graph has bounded degree, then the cost per solution for listing $k$-graphlets is reduced to $O(k)$. Whenever $k = O(1)$, as it is often the case in practical settings, these algorithms are the first to achieve constant time per solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version of the paper at Algorithmica (2025), after peer review</p></details> |

However, these actions often take time to implement (e.g., getting a degree can take years), and their effects may vary as the world evolves. Thus, it is natural to ask for recourse that remains valid in a dynamic environment. In this paper, we study the robustness of algorithmic recourse over time by casting the problem through the lens of causality. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that (even robust) causal AR methods can fail over time, except in the -- unlikely -- case that the world is stationary. Even more critically, unless the world is fully deterministic, counterfactual AR cannot be solved optimally. To account for this, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm for temporal AR that explicitly accounts for time under the assumption of having access to an estimator approximating the stochastic process. Our simulations on synthetic and realistic datasets show how considering time produces more resilient solutions to potential trends in the data distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint of a paper accepted at FAccT 2025.

Real-world scenarios often involve diverse and complex time patterns, which pose significant challenges for time encoding methods. While previous methods focus on capturing time patterns, many rely on specific inductive biases, such as using trigonometric functions to model periodicity. This narrow focus on single-pattern modeling makes them less effective in handling the diversity and complexities of real-world time patterns. In this paper, we investigate to improve the existing commonly used time encoding methods and introduce Learnable Transformation-based Generalized Time Encoding (LeTE). We propose using deep function learning techniques to parameterize non-linear transformations in time encoding, making them learnable and capable of modeling generalized time patterns, including diverse and complex temporal dynamics. By enabling learnable transformations, LeTE encompasses previous methods as specific cases and allows seamless integration into a wide range of tasks. Through extensive experiments across diverse domains, we demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of LeTE.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 19 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by leveraging labeled data from a related domain to detect anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, existing UDA methods assume consistent anomalous classes across domains. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation Contrastive learning model for Anomaly Detection in multivariate time series (DACAD), combining UDA with contrastive learning. DACAD utilizes an anomaly injection mechanism that enhances generalization across unseen anomalous classes, improving adaptability and robustness. Additionally, our model employs supervised contrastive loss for the source domain and self-supervised contrastive triplet loss for the target domain, ensuring comprehensive feature representation learning and domain-invariant feature extraction. Finally, an effective Center-based Entropy Classifier (CEC) accurately learns normal boundaries in the source domain. Extensive evaluations on multiple real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset highlight DACAD's superior performance in transferring knowledge across domains and mitigating the challenge of limited labeled data in TSAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[OLinear: A Linear Model for Time Series Forecasting in Orthogonally Transformed Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08550v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents $\mathbf{OLinear}$, a $\mathbf{linear}$-based multivariate time series forecasting model that operates in an $\mathbf{o}$rthogonally transformed domain. Recent forecasting models typically adopt the temporal forecast (TF) paradigm, which directly encode and decode time series in the time domain. However, the entangled step-wise dependencies in series data can hinder the performance of TF. To address this, some forecasters conduct encoding and decoding in the transformed domain using fixed, dataset-independent bases (e.g., sine and cosine signals in the Fourier transform). In contrast, we utilize $\mathbf{OrthoTrans}$, a data-adaptive transformation based on an orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes the series' temporal Pearson correlation matrix. This approach enables more effective encoding and decoding in the decorrelated feature domain and can serve as a plug-in module to enhance existing forecasters. To enhance the representation learning for multivariate time series, we introduce a customized linear layer, $\mathbf{NormLin}$, which employs a normalized weight matrix to capture multivariate dependencies. Empirically, the NormLin module shows a surprising performance advantage over multi-head self-attention, while requiring nearly half the FLOPs. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks and 140 forecasting tasks demonstrate that OLinear consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency. Notably, as a plug-in replacement for self-attention, the NormLin module consistently enhances Transformer-based forecasters.

We show that these concepts raise exciting new challenges in the context of Large Language Models for software test generation. More specifically, we formally define and investigate the properties of hardening and catching tests. A hardening test is one that seeks to protect against future regressions, while a catching test is one that catches such a regression or a fault in new functionality introduced by a code change. Hardening tests can be generated at any time and may become catching tests when a future regression is caught. We also define and motivate the Catching 'Just-in-Time' (JiTTest) Challenge, in which tests are generated 'just-in-time' to catch new faults before they land into production. We show that any solution to Catching JiTTest generation can also be repurposed to catch latent faults in legacy code. We enumerate possible outcomes for hardening and catching tests and JiTTests, and discuss open research problems, deployment options, and initial results from our work on automated LLM-based hardening at Meta.

Additionally, a secure ranging strategy is designed for backward compatibility with existing standards such as IEEE 802.15.4a/z, combined with an attack detection scheme. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed strategy are demonstrated through both simulation and experimental results in the case of the Ghost Peak attack, as demonstrated by Patrick Leu et al. The random time-hopping mechanism is verified to be capable of reducing the success rate of distance reduction attacks to less than 0.01%, thereby significantly enhancing the security of UWB ranging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Augmentation for Pose-invariant Face Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09256v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to enhance face recognition performance by augmenting head poses during the testing phase. Existing methods often rely on training on frontalised images or learning pose-invariant representations, yet both approaches typically require re-training and testing for each dataset, involving a substantial amount of effort. In contrast, this study proposes Pose-TTA, a novel approach that aligns faces at inference time without additional training. To achieve this, we employ a portrait animator that transfers the source image identity into the pose of a driving image. Instead of frontalising a side-profile face -- which can introduce distortion -- Pose-TTA generates matching side-profile images for comparison, thereby reducing identity information loss. Furthermore, we propose a weighted feature aggregation strategy to address any distortions or biases arising from the synthetic data, thus enhancing the reliability of the augmented images. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and with various pre-trained face recognition models demonstrate that Pose-TTA consistently improves inference performance. Moreover, our method is straightforward to integrate into existing face recognition pipelines, as it requires no retraining or fine-tuning of the underlying recognition models.</p></details> |  |

For a uniformly jointly strongly connected time-varying directed graph, we propose two distributed bandit online primal--dual algorithm with compressed communication to efficiently utilize communication resources in the one-point and two-point bandit feedback settings, respectively. In nonconvex optimization, finding a globally optimal decision is often NP-hard. As a result, the standard regret metric used in online convex optimization becomes inapplicable. To measure the performance of the proposed algorithms, we use a network regret metric grounded in the first-order optimality condition associated with the variational inequality. We show that the compressed algorithms establish sublinear network regret and cumulative constraint violation bounds. Finally, a simulation example is presented to validate the theoretical results.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 3 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.22410</p></details> |

In this paper, we consider a semiparametric marginal promotion time cure model for clustered right-censored survival data with a cure fraction. We propose two estimation methods based on the generalized estimating equations and the quadratic inference functions and prove that the regression estimates from the two proposed methods are consistent and asymptotic normal and that the estimates from the quadratic inference functions are optimal. The simulation study shows that the estimates from both methods are more efficient than those from the existing method no matter whether the correlation structure is correctly specified. The estimates based on the quadratic inference functions achieve higher efficiency compared with those based on the generalized estimating equations under the same working correlation structure. An application of the proposed methods is demonstrated with periodontal disease data and new findings are revealed in the analysis.</p></details> | 27 pages, 1 figure |

However, training VDMs from scratch can be challenging and requires large computational resources, limiting their wider application. Here, we propose a time-consistency discriminator that enables pretrained image diffusion models to generate realistic spatiotemporal dynamics. The discriminator guides the sampling inference process and does not require extensions or finetuning of the image diffusion model. We compare our approach against a VDM trained from scratch on an idealized turbulence simulation and a real-world global precipitation dataset. Our approach performs equally well in terms of temporal consistency, shows improved uncertainty calibration and lower biases compared to the VDM, and achieves stable centennial-scale climate simulations at daily time steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convolutional Fourier Analysis Network (CFAN): A Unified Time-Frequency Approach for ECG Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00497v3)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning has revolutionized biomedical signal analysis, particularly in electrocardiogram (ECG) classification. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel at automatic feature extraction, the optimal integration of time- and frequency-domain information remains unresolved. This study introduces the Convolutional Fourier Analysis Network (CFAN), a novel architecture that unifies time-frequency analysis by embedding Fourier principles directly into CNN layers. We evaluate CFAN against four benchmarks - spectrogram-based 2D CNN (SPECT); 1D CNN (CNN1D); Fourier-based 1D CNN (FFT1D); and CNN1D with integrated Fourier Analysis Network (CNN1D-FAN) - across three ECG tasks: arrhythmia classification (MIT-BIH), identity recognition (ECG-ID), and apnea detection (Apnea-ECG). CFAN achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing all competing methods with accuracies of 98.95% (MIT-BIH), 96.83% (ECG-ID), and 95.01% (Apnea-ECG). Notably, on ECG-ID and Apnea-ECG, CFAN demonstrated statistically significant improvements over the second-best method (CNN1D-FAN, $p \leq 0.02$), further validating its superior performance. Key innovations include CONV-FAN blocks that combine sine, cosine and GELU activations in convolutional layers to capture periodic features and joint time-frequency learning without spectrogram conversion. Our results highlight CFAN's potential for broader biomedical and signal classification applications.</p></details> |  |

Computing the minimum cost bi-chromatic matching is one of the core problems in geometric optimization that has found many applications, most notably in estimating Wasserstein distance between two distributions. In this work, we present the first fully dynamic algorithm for Euclidean bi-chromatic matching with sub-linear update time. For any fixed $\varepsilon > 0$, our algorithm achieves $O(1/\varepsilon)$-approximation and handles updates in $O(n^{\varepsilon})$ time. Our experiments show that our algorithm enables effective monitoring of the distributional drift in the Wasserstein distance on real and synthetic data sets, while outperforming the runtime of baseline approximations by orders of magnitudes.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Forecasting intermittent time series with Gaussian Processes and Tweedie likelihood](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19086v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We adopt Gaussian Processes (GPs) as latent functions for probabilistic forecasting of intermittent time series. The model is trained in a Bayesian framework that accounts for the uncertainty about the latent function and marginalizes it out when making predictions. We couple the latent GP variable with two types of forecast distributions: the negative binomial (NegBinGP) and the Tweedie distribution (TweedieGP). While the negative binomial has already been used in forecasting intermittent time series, this is the first time in which a fully parameterized Tweedie density is used for intermittent time series. We properly evaluate the Tweedie density, which has both a point mass at zero and heavy tails, avoiding simplifying assumptions made in existing models. We test our models on thousands of intermittent count time series. Results show that our models provide consistently better probabilistic forecasts than the competitors. In particular, TweedieGP obtains the best estimates of the highest quantiles, thus showing that it is more flexible than NegBinGP.</p></details> | Under review |

This framework leverages deep learning methodologies, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons and the newly developed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. It is optimized using economic information encapsulated by Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations and coupled algebraic equations. The application of neural networks holds the promise of accurately resolving high-dimensional problems with fewer computational demands and limitations compared to other numerical methods. This framework can be readily adapted for systems of partial differential equations in high dimensions. Importantly, it offers a more efficient (5$\times$ less CUDA memory and 40$\times$ fewer FLOPs in 100D problems) and user-friendly implementation than existing libraries. We also incorporate a time-stepping scheme to enhance training stability for nonlinear HJB equations, enabling the solution of 50D economic models.</p></details> | 30 pages, 13 figures |

Road damage anomalies such as potholes and cracks have emerged as a significant and recurring cause for accidents. To tackle this problem and improve road safety, a comprehensive system has been developed to detect potholes, cracks (e.g. alligator, transverse, longitudinal), classify their sizes, and transmit this data to the cloud for appropriate action by authorities. The system also broadcasts warning signals to nearby vehicles warning them if a severe anomaly is detected on the road. Moreover, the system can count road anomalies in real-time. It is emulated through the utilization of Raspberry Pi, a camera module, deep learning model, laptop, and cloud service. Deploying this innovative solution aims to proactively enhance road safety by notifying relevant authorities and drivers about the presence of potholes and cracks to take actions, thereby mitigating potential accidents arising from this prevalent road hazard leading to safer road conditions for the whole community.</p></details> |  |

However, implementing accurate autonomous control can be difficult due to poor end-effector proprioception, a limitation of their cable-driven mechanisms. Although the robot may have joint encoders for the end-effector pose calculation, various non-idealities make the entire kinematics chain inaccurate. Modern vision-based pose estimation methods lack real-time capability or can be hard to train and generalize. In this work, we demonstrate a real-time capable, vision transformer-based pose estimation approach that is trained using end-to-end differentiable kinematics and rendering in simulation. We demonstrate the potential of this method to correct for noisy pose estimates in simulation, with the longer term goal of verifying the sim-to-real transferability of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPAT: Sensitivity-based Multihead-attention Pruning on Time Series Forecasting Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08768v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention-based architectures have achieved superior performance in multivariate time series forecasting but are computationally expensive. Techniques such as patching and adaptive masking have been developed to reduce their sizes and latencies. In this work, we propose a structured pruning method, SPAT ($\textbf{S}$ensitivity $\textbf{P}$runer for $\textbf{At}$tention), which selectively removes redundant attention mechanisms and yields highly effective models. Different from previous approaches, SPAT aims to remove the entire attention module, which reduces the risk of overfitting and enables speed-up without demanding specialized hardware. We propose a dynamic sensitivity metric, $\textbf{S}$ensitivity $\textbf{E}$nhanced $\textbf{N}$ormalized $\textbf{D}$ispersion (SEND) that measures the importance of each attention module during the pre-training phase. Experiments on multivariate datasets demonstrate that SPAT-pruned models achieve reductions of 2.842% in MSE, 1.996% in MAE, and 35.274% in FLOPs. Furthermore, SPAT-pruned models outperform existing lightweight, Mamba-based and LLM-based SOTA methods in both standard and zero-shot inference, highlighting the importance of retaining only the most effective attention mechanisms. We have made our code publicly available https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SPAT-6042.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Implet, a novel post-hoc explainer that generates accurate and concise subsequence-level explanations for time series models. Our approach identifies critical temporal segments that significantly contribute to the model's predictions, providing enhanced interpretability beyond traditional feature-attribution methods. Based on it, we propose a cohort-based (group-level) explanation framework designed to further improve the conciseness and interpretability of our explanations. We evaluate Implet on several standard time-series classification benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving interpretability.

| **[TiMo: Spatiotemporal Foundation Model for Satellite Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08723v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite image time series (SITS) provide continuous observations of the Earth's surface, making them essential for applications such as environmental management and disaster assessment. However, existing spatiotemporal foundation models rely on plain vision transformers, which encode entire temporal sequences without explicitly capturing multiscale spatiotemporal relationships between land objects. This limitation hinders their effectiveness in downstream tasks. To overcome this challenge, we propose TiMo, a novel hierarchical vision transformer foundation model tailored for SITS analysis. At its core, we introduce a spatiotemporal gyroscope attention mechanism that dynamically captures evolving multiscale patterns across both time and space. For pre-training, we curate MillionST, a large-scale dataset of one million images from 100,000 geographic locations, each captured across 10 temporal phases over five years, encompassing diverse geospatial changes and seasonal variations. Leveraging this dataset, we adapt masked image modeling to pre-train TiMo, enabling it to effectively learn and encode generalizable spatiotemporal representations.Extensive experiments across multiple spatiotemporal tasks-including deforestation monitoring, land cover segmentation, crop type classification, and flood detection-demonstrate TiMo's superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Code, model, and dataset will be released at https://github.com/MiliLab/TiMo.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, if a quantum party can execute a semi-quantum token scheme (Shmueli 2022) with probability of success $1/2 + \delta$, we can build powerful cryptographic primitives with a multiplicative logarithmic overhead for the desired correctness error. Our scheme makes no assumptions about the quantum party's noise model except for a simple independence requirement: noise on two sets of non-entangled hardware must be independent. Using semi-quantum tokens and oracles which can only be queried classically, we first show how to construct a "short-lived" semi-quantum one-time program (OTP) which allows a classical sending party to prepare a one-time program on the receiving party's quantum computer. We then show how to use this semi-quantum OTP to construct a semi-quantum "stateful obfuscation" scheme (which we term "RAM obfuscation"). Importantly, the RAM obfuscation scheme does not require long-term quantum memory or global entanglement. Finally, we show how RAM obfuscation can be used to build long-lived one-time programs and copy-protection schemes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Simplification Algorithms for Interpretability of Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08846v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce metrics to evaluate the use of simplified time series in the context of interpretability of a TSC - a Time Series Classifier. Such simplifications are important because time series data, in contrast to text and image data, are not intuitively understandable to humans. These metrics are related to the complexity of the simplifications - how many segments they contain - and to their loyalty - how likely they are to maintain the classification of the original time series. We employ these metrics to evaluate four distinct simplification algorithms, across several TSC algorithms and across datasets of varying characteristics, from seasonal or stationary to short or long. Our findings suggest that using simplifications for interpretability of TSC is much better than using the original time series, particularly when the time series are seasonal, non-stationary and/or with low entropy.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, in clinical applications, it is essential to employ computational tools that provide only relevant information, ensuring clarity and ease of interpretation. In this work, we exploit two recently proposed operator learning approaches, namely Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and Kernel Operator Learning (KOL), to learn the operator mapping the applied stimulus in the physical domain into the activation and repolarization time distributions. These data-driven methods are evaluated on synthetic 2D and 3D domains, as well as on a physiologically realistic left ventricle geometry. Notably, while the learned map between the applied current and activation time has its modelling counterpart in the Eikonal model, no equivalent partial differential equation (PDE) model is known for the map between the applied current and repolarization time. Our results demonstrate that both FNO and KOL approaches are robust to hyperparameter choices and computationally efficient compared to traditional PDE-based Monodomain models. These findings highlight the potential use of these surrogate operators to accelerate cardiac simulations and facilitate their clinical integration.</p></details> | 31 pages, 17 figures |

For disturbances of bounded magnitude, we provide a semi-definite program whose feasibility implies the existence of a control law and a certificate ensuring safety in the infinite horizon with respect to the worst-case disturbance realization in the uncertainty set. For disturbances with unbounded support, we rely on martingale theory to derive a second semi-definite program whose feasibility provides probabilistic safety guarantees holding joint-in-time over a finite time horizon. We examine several extensions, including (i) encoding of different types of input constraints, (ii) robustification against distributional ambiguity around the true distribution, (iii) design of safety filters, and (iv) extension to general safety specifications such as obstacle avoidance.</p></details> |  |

However, past hybrid tutoring applications are limited in guiding tutor attention to students that require support. Specifically, existing conferencing tools, commonly used in hybrid tutoring, do not allow tutors to monitor multiple students' screens while directly communicating and attending to multiple students simultaneously. To address this issue, this paper introduces VTutor, a web-based platform leveraging peer-to-peer screen sharing and virtual avatars to deliver real-time, context-aware tutoring feedback at scale. By integrating a multi-student monitoring dashboard with AI-powered avatar prompts, VTutor empowers a single educator or tutor to rapidly detect off-task or struggling students and intervene proactively, thus enhancing the benefits of one-on-one interactions in classroom contexts with several students. Drawing on insight from the learning sciences and past research on animated pedagogical agents, we demonstrate how stylized avatars can potentially sustain student engagement while accommodating varying infrastructure constraints. Finally, we address open questions on refining large-scale, AI-driven tutoring solutions for improved learner outcomes, and how VTutor could help interpret real-time learner interactions to support remote tutors at scale. The VTutor platform can be accessed at https://ls2025.vtutor.ai. The system demo video is at https://ls2025.vtutor.ai/video.</p></details> | 6 pages |

However, hour-long video understanding, spanning over one hour and containing tens of thousands of visual frames, remains under-explored because of 1) challenging long-term video analyses, 2) inefficient large-model approaches, and 3) lack of large-scale benchmark datasets. Among them, in this paper, we focus on building a large-scale hour-long long video benchmark, HLV-1K, designed to evaluate long video understanding models. HLV-1K comprises 1009 hour-long videos with 14,847 high-quality question answering (QA) and multi-choice question asnwering (MCQA) pairs with time-aware query and diverse annotations, covering frame-level, within-event-level, cross-event-level, and long-term reasoning tasks. We evaluate our benchmark using existing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate its value for testing deep long video understanding capabilities at different levels and for various tasks. This includes promoting future long video understanding tasks at a granular level, such as deep understanding of long live videos, meeting recordings, and movies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICME 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Multi-scale Representation Learning Framework for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08199v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) offers broad utility in practical settings like energy consumption and weather prediction. Accurately predicting long-term changes, however, is demanding due to the intricate temporal patterns and inherent multi-scale variations within time series. This work confronts key issues in LTSF, including the suboptimal use of multi-granularity information, the neglect of channel-specific attributes, and the unique nature of trend and seasonal components, by introducing a proficient MLP-based forecasting framework. Our method adeptly disentangles complex temporal dynamics using clear, concurrent predictions across various scales. These multi-scale forecasts are then skillfully integrated through a system that dynamically assigns importance to information from different granularities, sensitive to individual channel characteristics. To manage the specific features of temporal patterns, a two-pronged structure is utilized to model trend and seasonal elements independently. Experimental results on eight LTSF benchmarks demonstrate that MDMixer improves average MAE performance by 4.64% compared to the recent state-of-the-art MLP-based method (TimeMixer), while achieving an effective balance between training efficiency and model interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature Fitted Online Conformal Prediction for Deep Time Series Forecasting Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08158v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is critical for many applications, where deep learning-based point prediction models have demonstrated strong performance. However, in practical scenarios, there is also a need to quantify predictive uncertainty through online confidence intervals. Existing confidence interval modeling approaches building upon these deep point prediction models suffer from key limitations: they either require costly retraining, fail to fully leverage the representational strengths of deep models, or lack theoretical guarantees. To address these gaps, we propose a lightweight conformal prediction method that provides valid coverage and shorter interval lengths without retraining. Our approach leverages features extracted from pre-trained point prediction models to fit a residual predictor and construct confidence intervals, further enhanced by an adaptive coverage control mechanism. Theoretically, we prove that our method achieves asymptotic coverage convergence, with error bounds dependent on the feature quality of the underlying point prediction model. Experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that our method delivers tighter confidence intervals while maintaining desired coverage rates.

| **[Time-varying Parameter Tensor Vector Autoregression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07975v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-varying parameter vector autoregression provides a flexible framework to capture structural changes within time series. However, when applied to high-dimensional data, this model encounters challenges of over-parametrization and computational burden. We address these challenges by building on recently proposed Tensor VAR models to represent the time-varying coefficient matrix as a third-order tensor with CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition, yielding three model configurations where different sets of components are specified as time-varying, each offering distinct interpretations. To select the model configuration and the decomposition rank, we evaluate multiple variants of Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) corresponding to the conditional and marginal DICs. Our simulation demonstrates that a specific conditional DIC variant provides more reliable results and accurately identifies true model configurations. We improve the accuracy of rank selection by applying knee point detection to the DICs, rather than defaulting to the minimum DIC value. Upon analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging data from story reading tasks, our selected model configurations suggest time-varying dynamics while reducing the number of parameters by over 90% relative to standard VARs. Granger causality analysis reveals directional brain connectivity patterns that align with narrative progression, with various regions functioning as signal emitters or receivers at different time points.</p></details> |  |
| **[4TaStiC: Time and trend traveling time series clustering for classifying long-term type 2 diabetes patients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07702v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diabetes is one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide, characterized by persistently high blood sugar levels, capable of damaging various internal organs and systems. Diabetes patients require routine check-ups, resulting in a time series of laboratory records, such as hemoglobin A1c, which reflects each patient's health behavior over time and informs their doctor's recommendations. Clustering patients into groups based on their entire time series data assists doctors in making recommendations and choosing treatments without the need to review all records. However, time series clustering of this type of dataset introduces some challenges; patients visit their doctors at different time points, making it difficult to capture and match trends, peaks, and patterns. Additionally, two aspects must be considered: differences in the levels of laboratory results and differences in trends and patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce a new clustering algorithm called Time and Trend Traveling Time Series Clustering (4TaStiC), using a base dissimilarity measure combined with Euclidean and Pearson correlation metrics. We evaluated this algorithm on artificial datasets, comparing its performance with that of seven existing methods. The results show that 4TaStiC outperformed the other methods on the targeted datasets. Finally, we applied 4TaStiC to cluster a cohort of 1,989 type 2 diabetes patients at Siriraj Hospital. Each group of patients exhibits clear characteristics that will benefit doctors in making efficient clinical decisions. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can be applied to contexts outside the medical field.</p></details> |  |

UAV networks are susceptible to several security threats, such as wormhole, jamming, spoofing, and false data injection. Time Delay Attack (TDA) is a unique attack in which malicious UAVs intentionally delay packet forwarding, posing significant threats, especially in time-sensitive applications. It is challenging to distinguish malicious delay from benign network delay due to the dynamic nature of UAV networks, intermittent wireless connectivity, or the Store-Carry-Forward (SCF) mechanism during multi-hop communication. Some existing works propose machine learning-based centralized approaches to detect TDA, which are computationally intensive and have large message overheads. This paper proposes a novel approach DATAMUt, where the temporal dynamics of the network are represented by a weighted time-window graph (TWiG), and then two deterministic polynomial-time algorithms are presented to detect TDA when UAVs have global and local network knowledge. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithms have reduced message overhead by a factor of five and twelve in global and local knowledge, respectively, compared to existing approaches. Additionally, our approaches achieve approximately 860 and 1050 times less execution time in global and local knowledge, respectively, outperforming the existing methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we propose a mean-field gradient descent dynamics for finding the MNE of zero-sum games involving $K$ players with $K\geq 2$. The evolution of the players' strategy distributions follows coupled mean-field gradient descent flows with momentum, incorporating an exponentially discounted time-averaging of gradients. First, in the case of a fixed entropic regularization, we prove an exponential convergence rate for the mean-field dynamics to the mixed Nash equilibrium with respect to the total variation metric. This improves a previous polynomial convergence rate for a similar time-averaged dynamics with different averaging factors. Moreover, unlike previous two-scale approaches for finding the MNE, our approach treats all player types on the same time scale. We also show that with a suitable choice of decreasing temperature, a simulated annealing version of the mean-field dynamics converges to an MNE of the initial unregularized problem.</p></details> | 21 pages |

This sense allows us to judge how long facts remain valid and when knowledge becomes outdated. Despite progress in vision, language, and motor control, AI still struggles to reason about temporal validity. We introduce Chronocept, the first benchmark to model temporal validity as a continuous probability distribution over time. Using skew-normal curves fitted along semantically decomposed temporal axes, Chronocept captures nuanced patterns of emergence, decay, and peak relevance. It includes two datasets: Benchmark I (atomic facts) and Benchmark II (multi-sentence passages). Annotations show strong inter-annotator agreement (84% and 89%). Our baselines predict curve parameters - location, scale, and skewness - enabling interpretable, generalizable learning and outperforming classification-based approaches. Chronocept fills a foundational gap in AI's temporal reasoning, supporting applications in knowledge grounding, fact-checking, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and proactive agents.

Foundation models, pre-trained on diverse datasets, can be applied in a zero-shot setting with minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare Google's TimesFM model to conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH and Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), using 19 years of daily returns from the SP 100 index and its constituents. Backtesting with over 8.5 years of out-of-sample data shows that the fine-tuned foundation model consistently outperforms traditional methods in actual-over-expected ratios. For the quantile score loss function, it performs comparably to the best econometric model, GAS. Overall, the foundation model ranks as the best or among the top performers across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 quantile forecasting. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy, showing that zero-shot use is not optimal for VaR.</p></details> |  |

These include microsecond temporal resolution, robustness under varying lighting conditions and low power consumption. Nevertheless, the effective processing of their sparse, asynchronous event streams remains challenging. Existing approaches to this problem can be categorised into two distinct groups. The first group involves the direct processing of event data with neural models, such as Spiking Neural Networks or Graph Convolutional Neural Networks. However, this approach is often accompanied by a compromise in terms of qualitative performance. The second group involves the conversion of events into dense representations with handcrafted aggregation functions, which can boost accuracy at the cost of temporal fidelity. This paper introduces a novel Self-Supervised Event Representation (SSER) method leveraging Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks to achieve precise per-pixel encoding of event timestamps and polarities without temporal discretisation. The recurrent layers are trained in a self-supervised manner to maximise the fidelity of event-time encoding. The inference is performed with event representations generated asynchronously, thus ensuring compatibility with high-throughput sensors. The experimental validation demonstrates that SSER outperforms aggregation-based baselines, achieving improvements of 2.4% mAP and 0.6% on the Gen1 and 1 Mpx object detection datasets. Furthermore, the paper presents the first hardware implementation of recurrent representation for event data on a System-on-Chip FPGA, achieving sub-microsecond latency and power consumption between 1-2 W, suitable for real-time, power-efficient applications.

However, existing contrastive learning-based and prompt-based LM approaches tend to be biased, often assigning a primary role to time series modality while treating text modality as secondary. We classify these approaches under a temporal-primary paradigm, which may overlook the unique and critical task-relevant information embedded in text modality like clinical reports, thus failing to fully leverage mutual benefits and complementarity of different modalities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel textual-temporal multimodal learning paradigm that enables either modality to serve as the primary while being enhanced by the other, thereby effectively capturing modality-specific information and fostering cross-modal interaction. In specific, we design MedualTime, a language model composed of dual adapters to implement temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. Within each adapter, lightweight adaptation tokens are injected into the top layers of LM to encourage high-level modality fusion. The shared LM pipeline by dual adapters not only achieves adapter alignment but also enables efficient fine-tuning, reducing computational resources. Empirically, MedualTime demonstrates superior performance on medical data, achieving notable improvements of 8% accuracy and 12% F1 in supervised settings. Furthermore, MedualTime's transferability is validated by few-shot label transfer experiments from coarse-grained to fine-grained medical data. https://github.com/start2020/MedualTime</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

Traditional sliding mode controllers with fixed parameters often struggle to maintain optimal performance under these fluctuating conditions. Therefore, an adaptive controller is essential to address these challenges by continuously tuning its gains in real-time. In this paper, we have tuned the slopes of the Fixed-time Sliding surface adaptively using reinforcement learning for coupled rendezvous and docking maneuver of chaser satellite with the target satellite in an unknown space environment. The neural network model is used to determine the optimal gains of reaching law of the fixed-time sliding surface. We have assumed that we don't have an accurate model of the system so we have added noise in the tangent space instead of directly on the manifold to preserve the geometric structure of the system while ensuring mathematically consistent uncertainty propagation. The reinforcement learning is used as an approximator to represent the value function of the agent to estimate the dynamical model of the system using the Actor-Critic method. The proposed control algorithm integrates a neural network and a sliding mode controller in a cascade loop architecture, where the tracking error dynamically tunes the sliding surface gains. Global fixed-time stability of the closed-loop feedback system is proved within the Lyapunov framework. This comprehensive approach of fixed-time sliding mode controller using a Reinforcement Learning based ensures the completion of the mission efficiently while addressing the critical challenges posed by the uncertain environment. The simulation results presented support the claims made.</p></details> |  |

The use of formal methods in AI ethics is a possible crucial approach for specifying and verifying the ethical behavior of AI systems. This paper proposes a formalization based on deontic logic to define and evaluate the ethical behavior of AI systems, focusing on system-level specifications, contributing to this important goal. It introduces axioms and theorems to capture ethical requirements related to fairness and explainability. The formalization incorporates temporal operators to reason about the ethical behavior of AI systems over time. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of this formalization by assessing the ethics of the real-world COMPAS and loan prediction AI systems. Various ethical properties of the COMPAS and loan prediction systems are encoded using deontic logical formulas, allowing the use of an automated theorem prover to verify whether these systems satisfy the defined properties. The formal verification reveals that both systems fail to fulfill certain key ethical properties related to fairness and non-discrimination, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed formalization in identifying potential ethical issues in real-world AI applications.</p></details> |  |

However, when operated in the high-recall, low-precision regime required for exhaustive event coverage in soccer analytics, their lack of contextual understanding becomes apparent: many false positives could be resolved by considering a broader sequence of actions and game-state information. In this work, we address this limitation by reasoning at the game level and improving STAD through the addition of a denoising sequence transduction task. Sequences of noisy, context-free player-centric predictions are processed alongside clean game state information using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model. By modeling extended temporal context and reasoning jointly over team-level dynamics, our method leverages the "language of soccer" - its tactical regularities and inter-player dependencies - to generate "denoised" sequences of actions. This approach improves both precision and recall in low-confidence regimes, enabling more reliable event extraction from broadcast video and complementing existing pixel-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, submitted to Advanced Concepts for Intelligent Vision Systems 2025</p></details> |

In adversarial environments where the route information of UAVs is unavailable, predicting future links must rely solely on the observed historical topological information of UANETs. However, the highly dynamic and sparse nature of UANET topologies presents substantial challenges in effectively capturing meaningful structural and temporal patterns for accurate link prediction. Most existing link prediction methods focus on temporal dynamics at a single structural scale while neglecting the effects of sparsity, resulting in insufficient information capture and limited applicability to UANETs. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale structural-temporal link prediction model (MUST) for UANETs. Specifically, we first employ graph attention networks (GATs) to capture structural features at multiple levels, including the individual UAV level, the UAV community level, and the overall network level. Then, we use long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to learn the temporal dynamics of these multi-scale structural features. Additionally, we address the impact of sparsity by introducing a sophisticated loss function during model optimization. We validate the performance of MUST using several UANET datasets generated through simulations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MUST achieves state-of-the-art link prediction performance in highly dynamic and sparse UANETs.</p></details> |  |

By embedding more modalities into end-to-end networks, the system's understanding of both static and dynamic aspects of the driving environment is enhanced, thereby improving the safety of autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce METDrive, an end-to-end system that leverages temporal guidance from the embedded time series features of ego states, including rotation angles, steering, throttle signals, and waypoint vectors. The geometric features derived from perception sensor data and the time series features of ego state data jointly guide the waypoint prediction with the proposed temporal guidance loss function. We evaluated METDrive on the CARLA leaderboard benchmarks, achieving a driving score of 70%, a route completion score of 94%, and an infraction score of 0.78.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA |

The integration of hierarchical structure and temporal evolution into knowledge graphs - along with the concept of comprehensive Text Units - facilitates the construction of richer, interconnected representations of legal knowledge. Through a detailed analysis of Graph RAG and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law, creating opportunities for more effective systems in legal research, legislative analysis, and decision support.</p></details> |  |

Instead, a few relevant individual frames are saved for documentation/reporting purposes and these are the frames on which most current colonoscopy AI models are trained on. While developing new unsupervised domain translation methods for colonoscopy (e.g. to translate between real optical and virtual/CT colonoscopy), it is thus typical to start with approaches that initially work for individual frames without temporal consistency. Once an individual-frame model has been finalized, additional contiguous frames are added with a modified deep learning architecture to train a new model from scratch for temporal consistency. This transition to temporally-consistent deep learning models, however, requires significantly more computational and memory resources for training. In this paper, we present a lightweight solution with a tunable temporal parameter, RT-GAN (Recurrent Temporal GAN), for adding temporal consistency to individual frame-based approaches that reduces training requirements by a factor of 5. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two challenging use cases in colonoscopy: haustral fold segmentation (indicative of missed surface) and realistic colonoscopy simulator video generation. We also release a first-of-its kind temporal dataset for colonoscopy for the above use cases. The datasets, accompanying code, and pretrained models will be made available on our Computational Endoscopy Platform GitHub (https://github.com/nadeemlab/CEP).

| **[Continuous Temporal Learning of Probability Distributions via Neural ODEs with Applications in Continuous Glucose Monitoring Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08698v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the continuous--time dynamics of probability distributions from time--dependent data samples is a fundamental problem in many fields, including digital health. The aim is to analyze how the distribution of a biomarker, such as glucose, evolves over time and how these changes may reflect the progression of chronic diseases such as diabetes. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic model based on a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture how samples from a continuous-time stochastic process evolve over the time. To model potential distribution shifts over time, we introduce a time-dependent function parameterized by a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) and estimate it non--parametrically using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The proposed model is highly interpretable, detects subtle temporal shifts, and remains computationally efficient. Through simulation studies, we show that it performs competitively in terms of estimation accuracy against state-of-the-art, less interpretable methods such as normalized gradient--flows and non--parameteric kernel density estimators. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method on digital clinical--trial data, showing how the interventions alters the time-dependent distribution of glucose levels and enabling a rigorous comparison of control and treatment groups from novel mathematical and clinical perspectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS-SNN: Temporal Shift Module for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04165v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly recognized for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, positioning them as strong alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in neuromorphic computing applications. SNNs inherently process temporal information by leveraging the precise timing of spikes, but balancing temporal feature utilization with low energy consumption remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce Temporal Shift module for Spiking Neural Networks (TS-SNN), which incorporates a novel Temporal Shift (TS) module to integrate past, present, and future spike features within a single timestep via a simple yet effective shift operation. A residual combination method prevents information loss by integrating shifted and original features. The TS module is lightweight, requiring only one additional learnable parameter, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing architectures with minimal additional computational cost. TS-SNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like CIFAR-10 (96.72\%), CIFAR-100 (80.28\%), and ImageNet (70.61\%) with fewer timesteps, while maintaining low energy consumption. This work marks a significant step forward in developing efficient and accurate SNN architectures.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |
| **[Structural-Temporal Coupling Anomaly Detection with Dynamic Graph Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08330v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalous edges in dynamic graphs is an important task in many applications over evolving triple-based data, such as social networks, transaction management, and epidemiology. A major challenge with this task is the absence of structural-temporal coupling information, which decreases the ability of the representation to distinguish anomalies from normal instances. Existing methods focus on handling independent structural and temporal features with embedding models, which ignore the deep interaction between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose a structural-temporal coupling anomaly detection architecture with a dynamic graph transformer model. Specifically, we introduce structural and temporal features from two integration levels to provide anomaly-aware graph evolutionary patterns. Then, a dynamic graph transformer enhanced by two-dimensional positional encoding is implemented to capture both discrimination and contextual consistency signals. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art models. Finally, a case study illustrates the strength of our method when applied to a real-world task.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Signal Temporal Logic Control Synthesis among Uncontrollable Dynamic Agents with Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04242v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The control of dynamical systems under temporal logic specifications among uncontrollable dynamic agents is challenging due to the agents' a-priori unknown behavior. Existing works have considered the problem where either all agents are controllable, the agent models are deterministic and known, or no safety guarantees are provided. We propose a predictive control synthesis framework that guarantees, with high probability, the satisfaction of signal temporal logic (STL) tasks that are defined over a controllable system in the presence of uncontrollable stochastic agents. We use trajectory predictors and conformal prediction to construct probabilistic prediction regions for each uncontrollable agent that are valid over multiple future time steps. Specifically, we construct a normalized prediction region over all agents and time steps to reduce conservatism and increase data efficiency. We then formulate a worst-case bilevel mixed integer program (MIP) that accounts for all agent realizations within the prediction region to obtain an open-loop controller that provably guarantee task satisfaction with high probability. To efficiently solve this bilevel MIP, we propose an equivalent MIP program based on KKT conditions of the original bilevel formulation. Building upon this, we design a closed-loop controller, where both recursive feasibility and task satisfaction can be guaranteed with high probability. We illustrate our control synthesis framework on two case studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Complexity-adaptive Temporal Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06164v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor decomposition is a fundamental tool for analyzing multi-dimensional data by learning low-rank factors to represent high-order interactions. While recent works on temporal tensor decomposition have made significant progress by incorporating continuous timestamps in latent factors, they still struggle with general tensor data with continuous indexes not only in the temporal mode but also in other modes, such as spatial coordinates in climate data. Moreover, the challenge of self-adapting model complexity is largely unexplored in functional temporal tensor models, with existing methods being inapplicable in this setting. To address these limitations, we propose functional \underline{C}omplexity-\underline{A}daptive \underline{T}emporal \underline{T}ensor d\underline{E}composition (\textsc{Catte}). Our approach encodes continuous spatial indexes as learnable Fourier features and employs neural ODEs in latent space to learn the temporal trajectories of factors. To enable automatic adaptation of model complexity, we introduce a sparsity-inducing prior over the factor trajectories. We develop an efficient variational inference scheme with an analytical evidence lower bound, enabling sampling-free optimization. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that \textsc{Catte} not only reveals the underlying ranks of functional temporal tensors but also significantly outperforms existing methods in prediction performance and robustness against noise.</p></details> |  |

Existing contrastive language-audio pretrained models are typically trained using global, clip-level descriptions, which provide only weak temporal supervision. We hypothesize that CLAP-like language-audio models - particularly, if they are expected to produce frame-level embeddings - can benefit from a stronger temporal supervision. To confirm our hypothesis, we curate a novel dataset of approximately 12,000 audio recordings from Freesound, each annotated with single-sentence free-text descriptions linked to a specific temporal segment in an audio recording. We use large language models to clean these annotations by removing references to non-audible events, transcribed speech, typos, and annotator language bias. We further propose a frame-wise contrastive training strategy that learns to align text descriptions with temporal regions in an audio recording and demonstrate that our model has better temporal text-audio alignment abilities compared to models trained only on global captions when evaluated on the AudioSet Strong benchmark.

However, existing reasoning methods primarily focus on positive importance of historical facts, neglecting adverse effects of outdated facts. Besides, training on these outdated facts yields extra computational cost. To address these challenges, we propose an outdated fact filtering framework named HALO, which quantifies the temporal validity of historical facts by exploring the half-life theory to filter outdated facts in TKGs. HALO consists of three modules: the temporal fact attention module, the dynamic relation-aware encoder module, and the outdated fact filtering module. Firstly, the temporal fact attention module captures the evolution of historical facts over time to identify relevant facts. Secondly, the dynamic relation-aware encoder module is designed for efficiently predicting the half life of each fact. Finally, we construct a time decay function based on the half-life theory to quantify the temporal validity of facts and filter outdated facts. Experimental results show that HALO outperforms the state-of-the-art TKG reasoning methods on three public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and filtering outdated facts (Codes are available at https://github.com/yushuowiki/K-Half/tree/main ).</p></details> |  |

To this end, we present TemPoFast3D, a novel method that leverages temporal coherency of human appearance to reduce redundant computation while maintaining reconstruction quality. Our approach is a "plug-and play" solution that uniquely transforms pixel-aligned reconstruction networks to handle continuous video streams by maintaining and refining a canonical appearance representation through efficient coordinate mapping.

This letter proposes a two-stage framework to address this challenge. First, exponentially decaying tracking error bounds are derived with multidimensional geometric control gains obtained via differential evolution. These bounds are less conservative, while the resulting tracking errors exhibit smaller oscillations and improved transient performance. Second, leveraging the time-varying bounds, a mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) formulation generates piecewise B\'ezier reference trajectories that satisfy STL and velocity limits, while ensuring inter-agent safety through convex-hull properties. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach enables formally verifiable multi-agent coordination in constrained environments, with provable tracking guarantees under bounded disturbances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jointly spatial-temporal representation learning for individual trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04055v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual trajectories, rich in human-environment interaction information across space and time, serve as vital inputs for geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs). However, existing attempts at learning trajectory representations have overlooked the implicit spatial-temporal dependency within trajectories, failing to encode such dependency in a deep learning-friendly format. That poses a challenge in obtaining general-purpose trajectory representations. Therefore, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal joint representation learning method (ST-GraphRL) to formalize learnable spatial-temporal dependencies into trajectory representations. The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a weighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility interactions in both space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage jointly encoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion), to learn entangled spatial-temporal dependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating space and time information; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn explicit mobility regularities by simulating the spatial-temporal distributions of trajectories. Tested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed ST-GraphRL outperformed all the baseline models in predicting movement spatial-temporal distributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal correlations. Analyzing spatial-temporal features presented in latent space validates that ST-GraphRL understands spatial-temporal patterns. This study may also benefit representation learnings of other geospatial data to achieve general-purpose data representations and advance GeoFMs development.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 3 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

The knowledge acquisition at a certain time point may be strongly inspired with the help of previous experience. Thus the knowledge growing procedure should show strong relationship along the temporal dimension. In our research, we find that during the network training, the evolution of feature map follows temporal sequence property. A proper temporal supervision may further improve the network training performance. Inspired by this observation, we propose Temporal Supervised Knowledge Distillation (TSKD). Specifically, we extract the spatiotemporal features in the different training phases of student by convolutional Long Short-term memory network (Conv-LSTM). Then, we train the student net through a dynamic target, rather than static teacher network features. This process realizes the refinement of old knowledge in student network, and utilizes it to assist current learning. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and advantages of our method over existing knowledge distillation methods, including various network architectures and different tasks (image classification and object detection) .</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is outdated and needs new improvements to make it valuable</p></details> |

While network diameter has been extensively studied in static networks, its definition and behavior in temporal networks remain underexplored due to their dynamic nature. In this study, we present a formal mathematical framework for analyzing diameter in temporal networks and introduce three time-aware metrics: Effective Diameter , Peak Diameter (*D), and t-Diameter (tD), each capturing distinct temporal aspects of connectivity and diffusion. Our approach combines theoretical analysis with empirical validation using four real-world datasets: high school, hospital, conference, and workplace contact networks. We simulate flow propagation on temporal networks and compare the observed diameters with the proposed theoretical Equations. Across all datasets, our model demonstrates high accuracy, with low RMSE and absolute error values. Furthermore, we observe that the effective diameter decreases with increasing average degree and increases with network size. The results also show that tD and *D are more sensitive to node removal, highlighting their relevance for applications such as epidemic modeling. By bridging formal modeling and empirical data, our framework offers new insights into the temporal dynamics of networked systems and provides tools for assessing robustness, controlling information spread, and optimizing interventions in time-sensitive environments.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose a Constrained Monotonic Adaptive Network (CoMAN) method for spatio-temporal perception within marketing pricing. Specifically, we capture spatio-temporal preferences within attribute features through two foundational spatio-temporal perception modules. To further enhance catching the user sensitivity differentials to incentives across varied times and locations, we design modules for learning spatio-temporal convexity and concavity as well as for expressing sensitivity functions. CoMAN can achieve a more efficient allocation of incentive investments during pricing, thus increasing the conversion rate and orders while maintaining budget efficiency. Extensive offline and online experimental results within our diverse marketing campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while outperforming the monotonic state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Weakly Supervised Temporal Sentence Grounding via Positive Sample Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06557v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of weakly supervised temporal sentence grounding (WSTSG) aims to detect temporal intervals corresponding to a language description from untrimmed videos with only video-level video-language correspondence. For an anchor sample, most existing approaches generate negative samples either from other videos or within the same video for contrastive learning. However, some training samples are highly similar to the anchor sample, directly regarding them as negative samples leads to difficulties for optimization and ignores the correlations between these similar samples and the anchor sample. To address this, we propose Positive Sample Mining (PSM), a novel framework that mines positive samples from the training set to provide more discriminative supervision. Specifically, for a given anchor sample, we partition the remaining training set into semantically similar and dissimilar subsets based on the similarity of their text queries. To effectively leverage these correlations, we introduce a PSM-guided contrastive loss to ensure that the anchor proposal is closer to similar samples and further from dissimilar ones. Additionally, we design a PSM-guided rank loss to ensure that similar samples are closer to the anchor proposal than to the negative intra-video proposal, aiming to distinguish the anchor proposal and the negative intra-video proposal. Experiments on the WSTSG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>TCSVT...</summary><p>TCSVT 2025, doi at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10970001</p></details> |
| **[New Algorithms for Incremental Minimum Spanning Trees and Temporal Graph Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04619v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Processing graphs with temporal information (the temporal graphs) has become increasingly important in the real world. In this paper, we study efficient solutions to temporal graph applications using new algorithms for Incremental Minimum Spanning Trees (MST). The first contribution of this work is to formally discuss how a broad set of setting-problem combinations of temporal graph processing can be solved using incremental MST, along with their theoretical guarantees. Despite the importance of the problem, we observe a gap between theory and practice for efficient incremental MST algorithms. While many classic data structures, such as the link-cut tree, provide strong bounds for incremental MST, their performance is limited in practice. Meanwhile, existing practical solutions used in applications do not have any non-trivial theoretical guarantees. Our second and main contribution includes new algorithms for incremental MST that are efficient both in theory and in practice. Our new data structure, the AM-tree, achieves the same theoretical bound as the link-cut tree for temporal graph processing and shows strong performance in practice. In our experiments, the AM-tree has competitive or better performance than existing practical solutions due to theoretical guarantees, and can be significantly faster than the link-cut tree (7.8-11x in updates and 7.7-13.7x in queries).</p></details> |  |

This temporal and spatial variation challenges the effectiveness of fixed-distance quantum error correction (QEC) codes. In this paper, we analyze 12 days of calibration data from IBM's 127-qubit device (ibm_kyiv), showing the fluctuation of Pauli-X and CNOT gate error rates. We demonstrate that fixed-distance QEC can either underperform or lead to excessive overhead, depending on the selected qubit and the error rate of the day. We then propose a simple adaptive QEC approach that selects an appropriate code distance per qubit, based on daily error rates. Using logical error rate modeling, we identify qubits that cannot be used and qubits that can be recovered with minimal resources. Our method avoids unnecessary resource overhead by excluding outlier qubits and tailoring code distances. Across 12 calibration days on ibm_kyiv, our adaptive strategy reduces physical qubit overhead by over 50% per logical qubit while maintaining access to 85-100% of usable qubits. To further validate the method, we repeat the experiment on two additional 127-qubit devices, ibm_brisbane and ibm_sherbrooke, where the overhead savings reach up to 71% while still preserving over 80% qubit usability. This approach offers a practical and efficient path forward for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)-era QEC strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, forecasting multivariate time series with Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal (cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters, delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/nyuolab/Gateformer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizing Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods to probe for spatial correlations in temporal networks and infer their topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16070v3)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motifs are thought to be some fundamental components of social face-to-face interaction temporal networks. However, the motifs previously considered are either limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles, which are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of social systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these triangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be mined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the edge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods motifs of the literature. We also confirm in empirical data that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to the Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show how mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for spatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that network. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the edge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions. In the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the edge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network they were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development, that we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiGIT: Multi-Dilated Gated Encoder and Central-Adjacent Region Integrated Decoder for Temporal Action Detection Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05711v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we examine a key limitation in query-based detectors for temporal action detection (TAD), which arises from their direct adaptation of originally designed architectures for object detection. Despite the effectiveness of the existing models, they struggle to fully address the unique challenges of TAD, such as the redundancy in multi-scale features and the limited ability to capture sufficient temporal context. To address these issues, we propose a multi-dilated gated encoder and central-adjacent region integrated decoder for temporal action detection transformer (DiGIT). Our approach replaces the existing encoder that consists of multi-scale deformable attention and feedforward network with our multi-dilated gated encoder. Our proposed encoder reduces the redundant information caused by multi-level features while maintaining the ability to capture fine-grained and long-range temporal information. Furthermore, we introduce a central-adjacent region integrated decoder that leverages a more comprehensive sampling strategy for deformable cross-attention to capture the essential information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiGIT achieves state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14, ActivityNet v1.3, and HACS-Segment.

Recently, self-supervised learning methods have emerged to tackle motion planning problems without requiring expensive expert demonstrations. They solve the Eikonal equation for training neural networks and lead to efficient solutions. However, these methods struggle in complex environments because they fail to maintain key properties of the Eikonal equation, such as optimal value functions and geodesic distances. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised temporal difference metric learning approach that solves the Eikonal equation more accurately and enhances performance in solving complex and unseen planning tasks. Our method enforces Bellman's principle of optimality over finite regions, using temporal difference learning to avoid spurious local minima while incorporating metric learning to preserve the Eikonal equation's essential geodesic properties. We demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing self-supervised learning methods in handling complex environments and generalizing to unseen environments, with robot configurations ranging from 2 to 12 degrees of freedom (DOF).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[GraphComp: Extreme Error-bounded Compression of Scientific Data via Temporal Graph Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06316v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of voluminous scientific data poses significant challenges for efficient storage, transfer, and analysis. Recently, error-bounded lossy compression methods emerged due to their ability to achieve high compression ratios while controlling data distortion. However, they often overlook the inherent spatial and temporal correlations within scientific data, thus missing opportunities for higher compression. In this paper we propose GRAPHCOMP, a novel graph-based method for error-bounded lossy compression of scientific data. We perform irregular segmentation of the original grid data and generate a graph representation that preserves the spatial and temporal correlations. Inspired by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we then propose a temporal graph autoencoder to learn latent representations that significantly reduce the size of the graph, effectively compressing the original data. Decompression reverses the process and utilizes the learnt graph model together with the latent representation to reconstruct an approximation of the original data. The decompressed data are guaranteed to satisfy a user-defined point-wise error bound. We compare our method against the state-of-the-art error-bounded lossy methods (i.e., HPEZ, SZ3.1, SPERR, and ZFP) on large-scale real and synthetic data. GRAPHCOMP consistently achieves the highest compression ratio across most datasets, outperforming the second-best method by margins ranging from 22% to 50%.</p></details> |  |
| **[USTEP: Spatio-Temporal Predictive Learning under A Unified View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05829v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal predictive learning plays a crucial role in self-supervised learning, with wide-ranging applications across a diverse range of fields. Previous approaches for temporal modeling fall into two categories: recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods. The former, while meticulously processing frames one by one, neglect short-term spatio-temporal information redundancies, leading to inefficiencies. The latter naively stack frames sequentially, overlooking the inherent temporal dependencies. In this paper, we re-examine the two dominant temporal modeling approaches within the realm of spatio-temporal predictive learning, offering a unified perspective. Building upon this analysis, we introduce USTEP (Unified Spatio-TEmporal Predictive learning), an innovative framework that reconciles the recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods by integrating both micro-temporal and macro-temporal scales. Extensive experiments on a wide range of spatio-temporal predictive learning demonstrate that USTEP achieves significant improvements over existing temporal modeling approaches, thereby establishing it as a robust solution for a wide range of spatio-temporal applications.</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |

We formulate STL constraints as a robust optimization problem (ROP) and recast it as a scenario optimization program (SOP) to construct STTs with formal correctness guarantees. We also propose a closed-form control law that operates independently of the system dynamics, and ensures the system trajectory evolves within the STTs, thereby satisfying the STL specifications. The proposed approach is validated through case studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior computational efficiency, trajectory quality, and applicability to complex STL tasks.</p></details> |  |

The observability of the space assets on the other hand requires efficient analysis on when and how observed space objects can be controlled. This becomes crucial when real-world spatial dynamics are taken into account as it introduces complexities into the system. The real-world dynamics can reveal the structure of the network including isolated and dominant stations. We propose a Temporal Spectrum Analysis (TSA) scheme that takes into account a set of real-world parameters including actual dynamics of the objects in space to analyze the structure of a ground-space network that inherits temporal spectrum as the key element of design. We study the potential interactions between multiple constellations using TSA and conduct a comprehensive real-world simulations to quantify the structure of the network. Numerical results show how the temporal spectrum of each satellite affects the intra- and inter-constellation network structure including interactions between ground stations and constellations.</p></details> |  |

However, most of the existing frameworks focus on the simplified scenario where knowledge does not change over time and does not cover the temporal dimension. In this work we consider the much more challenging problem of knowledge-driven sequence classification where different portions of knowledge must be employed at different timesteps, and temporal relations are available. Our experimental evaluation compares multi-stage neuro-symbolic and neural-only architectures, and it is conducted on a newly-introduced benchmarking framework. Results demonstrate the challenging nature of this novel setting, and also highlight under-explored shortcomings of neuro-symbolic methods, representing a precious reference for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing learning-based methods for event-based optical flow adopt frame-based techniques, ignoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of events. Additionally, these methods assume linear motion between consecutive events within the loss time window, which increases optical flow errors in long-time sequences. In this work, we observe that rich spatio-temporal information and accurate nonlinear motion between events are crucial for event-based optical flow estimation. Therefore, we propose E-NMSTFlow, a novel unsupervised event-based optical flow network focusing on long-time sequences. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Motion Feature Aware (STMFA) module and an Adaptive Motion Feature Enhancement (AMFE) module, both of which utilize rich spatio-temporal information to learn spatio-temporal data associations. Meanwhile, we propose a nonlinear motion compensation loss that utilizes the accurate nonlinear motion between events to improve the unsupervised learning of our network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Remarkably, our method ranks first among unsupervised learning methods on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets.

As a result, temporal interaction graph representation learning (TIGRL) has garnered significant attention in recent years. TIGRL aims to embed nodes in TIGs into low-dimensional representations that effectively preserve both structural and temporal information, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as classification, prediction, and clustering within constantly evolving data environments. In this paper, we begin by introducing the foundational concepts of TIGs and emphasize the critical role of temporal dependencies. We then propose a comprehensive taxonomy of state-of-the-art TIGRL methods, systematically categorizing them based on the types of information utilized during the learning process to address the unique challenges inherent to TIGs. To facilitate further research and practical applications, we curate the source of datasets and benchmarks, providing valuable resources for empirical investigations. Finally, we examine key open challenges and explore promising research directions in TIGRL, laying the groundwork for future advancements that have the potential to shape the evolution of this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCAI...</summary><p>IJCAI 2025 Survey Track</p></details> |

While these predominantly analog optical accelerators bypass digitization to perform parallel floating-point computations, scaling optical hardware to map large-vector sizes for AI tasks remains challenging. Here, we overcome this limitation by unfolding scalar operations in time and introducing a photonic-heater-in-lightpath (PHIL) unit for all-optical temporal integration. Counterintuitively, we exploit a slow heat dissipation process to integrate optical signals modulated at 50 GHz bridging the speed gap between the widely applied thermo-optic effects and ultrafast photonics. This architecture supports optical end-to-end signal processing, eliminates inefficient electro-optical conversions, and enables both linear and nonlinear operations within a unified framework. Our results demonstrate a scalable path towards high-speed photonic computing through thermally driven integration.</p></details> |  |

Existing ATFL methods rely on training efficient networks using fine-grained annotations, which are obtained costly and challenging in real-world scenarios. To meet this challenge, in this paper, we propose a progressive audio-language co-learning network (LOCO) that adopts co-learning and self-supervision manners to prompt localization performance under weak supervision scenarios. Specifically, an audio-language co-learning module is first designed to capture forgery consensus features by aligning semantics from temporal and global perspectives. In this module, forgery-aware prompts are constructed by using utterance-level annotations together with learnable prompts, which can incorporate semantic priors into temporal content features dynamically. In addition, a forgery localization module is applied to produce forgery proposals based on fused forgery-class activation sequences. Finally, a progressive refinement strategy is introduced to generate pseudo frame-level labels and leverage supervised semantic contrastive learning to amplify the semantic distinction between real and fake content, thereby continuously optimizing forgery-aware features. Extensive experiments show that the proposed LOCO achieves SOTA performance on three public benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9page...</summary><p>9pages, 5figures.

The objective of the presented systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and over 150 journal papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive collection of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in future studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of the results of current spatio-temporal GNN models in different domains.

In a multi-user multi-server MEC network, the mobility of terminals causes computing requests to be dynamically distributed in space. At the same time, the non-negligible dependencies among tasks in some specific applications impose temporal correlation constraints on the solution as well, leading the time-adjacent tasks to experience varying resource availability and competition from parallel counterparts. To address such dynamic spatial-temporal characteristics as a challenge in the allocation of communication and computation resources, we formulate a long-term delay-energy trade-off cost minimization problem in the view of jointly optimizing task offloading and resource allocation. We begin by designing a priority evaluation scheme to decouple task dependencies and then develop a grouped Knapsack problem for channel allocation considering the current data load and channel status. Afterward, in order to meet the rapid response needs of MEC systems, we exploit the double duel deep Q network (D3QN) to make offloading decisions and integrate channel allocation results into the reward as part of the dynamic environment feedback in D3QN, constituting the joint optimization of task offloading and channel allocation. Finally, comprehensive simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in the delay-energy trade-off cost and its adaptability for various applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models often struggle with effectively capturing the complex relationships between target variables and covariates, as well as the interactions between temporal dynamics and multivariate data, leading to suboptimal forecasting accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model architecture that leverages the iTransformer for feature extraction from target variables and employs long short-term memory (LSTM) to extract features from covariates. A cross-attention mechanism is integrated to fuse the outputs of both models, followed by a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) mapping for enhanced representation. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated using publicly available datasets from Australia, with experiments conducted across four seasons. Results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively capture seasonal variations in PV power generation and improve forecasting accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions often rely on a pre-alignment strategy to normalize data, which can distort intrinsic patterns and escalate computational and memory demands. Addressing these limitations, we introduce STRGCN, a Spatio-Temporal Relational Graph Convolutional Network that avoids pre-alignment and directly captures the complex interdependencies in IMTS by representing them as a fully connected graph. Each observation is represented as a node, allowing the model to effectively handle misaligned timestamps by mapping all inter-node relationships, thus faithfully preserving the asynchronous nature of the data. Moreover, we enhance this model with a hierarchical ``Sandwich'' structure that strategically aggregates nodes to optimize graph embeddings, reducing computational overhead while maintaining detailed local and global context. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that STRGCN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, competitive memory usage and training speed.</p></details> |  |

While models such as Izhikevich can replicate a wide range of these firing dynamics, their complexity poses challenges for directly integrating them into scalable spiking neural networks (SNN) training pipelines. In this work, we propose two probabilistically driven, input-level temporal spike transformations: Poisson-Burst and Delayed-Burst that introduce biologically inspired temporal variability directly into standard Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons. This enables scalable training and systematic evaluation of how spike timing dynamics affect privacy, generalization, and learning performance. Poisson-Burst modulates burst occurrence based on input intensity, while Delayed-Burst encodes input strength through burst onset timing. Through extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that Poisson-Burst maintains competitive accuracy and lower resource overhead while exhibiting enhanced privacy robustness against membership inference attacks, whereas Delayed-Burst provides stronger privacy protection at a modest accuracy trade-off. These findings highlight the potential of biologically grounded temporal spike dynamics in improving the privacy, generalization and biological plausibility of neuromorphic learning systems.</p></details> |  |

To ensure call-taking performance consistency, quality assurance is implemented to evaluate and refine call-takers' skillsets. However, traditional human-led evaluations struggle with high call volumes, leading to low coverage and delayed assessments. We introduce LogiDebrief, an AI-driven framework that automates traditional 9-1-1 call debriefing by integrating Signal-Temporal Logic (STL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) for fully-covered rigorous performance evaluation. LogiDebrief formalizes call-taking requirements as logical specifications, enabling systematic assessment of 9-1-1 calls against procedural guidelines. It employs a three-step verification process: (1) contextual understanding to identify responder types, incident classifications, and critical conditions; (2) STL-based runtime checking with LLM integration to ensure compliance; and (3) automated aggregation of results into quality assurance reports. Beyond its technical contributions, LogiDebrief has demonstrated real-world impact. Successfully deployed at Metro Nashville Department of Emergency Communications, it has assisted in debriefing 1,701 real-world calls, saving 311.85 hours of active engagement. Empirical evaluation with real-world data confirms its accuracy, while a case study and extensive user study highlight its effectiveness in enhancing call-taking performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCAI-2025</p></details> |

Simulating a control system can show general trends, but a formal tool like reachability analysis can provide guarantees of correctness. Reachability analysis for complex control systems, e.g., with nonlinear dynamics and/or a neural network controller, is often either slow or overly conservative. To address these challenges, much literature has focused on spatial refinement, i.e., tuning the discretization of the input sets and intermediate reachable sets. This paper introduces the idea of temporal refinement: automatically choosing when along the horizon of the reachability problem to execute slow symbolic queries which incur less approximation error versus fast concrete queries which incur more approximation error. Temporal refinement can be combined with other refinement approaches as an additional tool to trade off tractability and tightness in approximate reachable set computation. We introduce a temporal refinement algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness at computing approximate reachable sets for nonlinear systems with neural network controllers. We calculate reachable sets with varying computational budget and show that our algorithm can generate approximate reachable sets with a similar amount of error to the baseline in 20-70% less time.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the proceedings of the American Control Conference (ACC) 2025</p></details> |
| **[ESTA: An Efficient Spatial-Temporal Range Aggregation Query Processing Algorithm for UAV Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11977v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks are increasingly deployed in military and civilian applications, serving as critical platforms for data collection. Users frequently require aggregated statistical information derived from historical sensory data within specific spatial and temporal boundaries. To address this, users submit aggregation query requests with spatial-temporal constraints to target UAVs that store the relevant data. These UAVs process and return the query results, which can be aggregated within the network during transmission to conserve energy and bandwidth-resources that are inherently limited in UAV networks. However,the dynamic topology caused by UAV mobility, coupled with these resource constraints, makes efficient in-network aggregation challenging without compromising user query delay. To the best of our knowledge, existing research has yet to adequately explore spatial-temporal range aggregation queries in the context of UAV networks. In this paper, we propose ESTA, an Efficient Spatial-Temporal range Aggregation query processing algorithm tailored for UAV networks. ESTA leverages pre-planned UAV trajectories to construct a topology change graph that models the network's evolving connectivity. It then employs an efficient shortest path algorithm to determine the minimum query response delay. Subsequently, while adhering to user-specified delay constraints, ESTA transforms the in-network aggregation process into a series of set cover problems, which are solved recursively to build a Spatial-Temporal Aggregation Tree (STAT). This tree enables the identification of an energy-efficient routing path for aggregating and delivering query results. Extensive simulations demonstrate that ESTA reduces energy consumption by more than 50% compared to a baseline algorithm, all while satisfying the required query delay.</p></details> | 15 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Modality-Guided Dynamic Graph Fusion and Temporal Diffusion for Self-Supervised RGB-T Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03507v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To reduce the reliance on large-scale annotations, self-supervised RGB-T tracking approaches have garnered significant attention. However, the omission of the object region by erroneous pseudo-label or the introduction of background noise affects the efficiency of modality fusion, while pseudo-label noise triggered by similar object noise can further affect the tracking performance. In this paper, we propose GDSTrack, a novel approach that introduces dynamic graph fusion and temporal diffusion to address the above challenges in self-supervised RGB-T tracking. GDSTrack dynamically fuses the modalities of neighboring frames, treats them as distractor noise, and leverages the denoising capability of a generative model. Specifically, by constructing an adjacency matrix via an Adjacency Matrix Generator (AMG), the proposed Modality-guided Dynamic Graph Fusion (MDGF) module uses a dynamic adjacency matrix to guide graph attention, focusing on and fusing the object's coherent regions. Temporal Graph-Informed Diffusion (TGID) models MDGF features from neighboring frames as interference, and thus improving robustness against similar-object noise. Extensive experiments conducted on four public RGB-T tracking datasets demonstrate that GDSTrack outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.

| **[DDaTR: Dynamic Difference-aware Temporal Residual Network for Longitudinal Radiology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03401v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiology Report Generation (RRG) automates the creation of radiology reports from medical imaging, enhancing the efficiency of the reporting process. Longitudinal Radiology Report Generation (LRRG) extends RRG by incorporating the ability to compare current and prior exams, facilitating the tracking of temporal changes in clinical findings. Existing LRRG approaches only extract features from prior and current images using a visual pre-trained encoder, which are then concatenated to generate the final report. However, these methods struggle to effectively capture both spatial and temporal correlations during the feature extraction process. Consequently, the extracted features inadequately capture the information of difference across exams and thus underrepresent the expected progressions, leading to sub-optimal performance in LRRG. To address this, we develop a novel dynamic difference-aware temporal residual network (DDaTR). In DDaTR, we introduce two modules at each stage of the visual encoder to capture multi-level spatial correlations. The Dynamic Feature Alignment Module (DFAM) is designed to align prior features across modalities for the integrity of prior clinical information. Prompted by the enriched prior features, the dynamic difference-aware module (DDAM) captures favorable difference information by identifying relationships across exams. Furthermore, our DDaTR employs the dynamic residual network to unidirectionally transmit longitudinal information, effectively modelling temporal correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrated superior performance over existing methods on three benchmarks, proving its efficacy in both RRG and LRRG tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Thought Textual Reasoning for Few-shot Temporal Action Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13460v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional temporal action localization (TAL) methods rely on large amounts of detailed annotated data, whereas few-shot TAL reduces this dependence by using only a few training samples to identify unseen action categories. However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought (CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios. We will release our code, data and benchmark.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Predicting Temporal Changes in a Patient's Chest X-ray Images based on Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07012v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chest X-ray (CXR) is an important diagnostic tool widely used in hospitals to assess patient conditions and monitor changes over time. Recently, generative models, specifically diffusion-based models, have shown promise in generating realistic synthetic CXRs. However, these models mainly focus on conditional generation using single-time-point data, i.e., generating CXRs conditioned on their corresponding reports from a specific time. This limits their clinical utility, particularly for capturing temporal changes. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, EHRXDiff, which predicts future CXR images by integrating previous CXRs with subsequent medical events, e.g., prescriptions, lab measures, etc. Our framework dynamically tracks and predicts disease progression based on a latent diffusion model, conditioned on the previous CXR image and a history of medical events. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of our framework across three key aspects, including clinical consistency, demographic consistency, and visual realism. Results show that our framework generates high-quality, realistic future images that effectively capture potential temporal changes. This suggests that our framework could be further developed to support clinical decision-making and provide valuable insights for patient monitoring and treatment planning in the medical field. The code is available at https://github.com/dek924/EHRXDiff.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Proc. of Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning (CHIL) 2025 (10 pages for main text, 3 pages for references, 8 pages for supplementary materials)</p></details> |
| **[FolAI: Synchronized Foley Sound Generation with Semantic and Temporal Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15023v3)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional sound design workflows rely on manual alignment of audio events to visual cues, as in Foley sound design, where everyday actions like footsteps or object interactions are recreated to match the on-screen motion. This process is time-consuming, difficult to scale, and lacks automation tools that preserve creative intent. Despite recent advances in vision-to-audio generation, producing temporally coherent and semantically controllable sound effects from video remains a major challenge. To address these limitations, we introduce FolAI, a two-stage generative framework that decouples the when and the what of sound synthesis, i.e., the temporal structure extraction and the semantically guided generation, respectively. In the first stage, we estimate a smooth control signal from the video that captures the motion intensity and rhythmic structure over time, serving as a temporal scaffold for the audio. In the second stage, a diffusion-based generative model produces sound effects conditioned both on this temporal envelope and on high-level semantic embeddings, provided by the user, that define the desired auditory content (e.g., material or action type). This modular design enables precise control over both timing and timbre, streamlining repetitive tasks while preserving creative flexibility in professional Foley workflows. Results on diverse visual contexts, such as footstep generation and action-specific sonorization, demonstrate that our model reliably produces audio that is temporally aligned with visual motion, semantically consistent with user intent, and perceptually realistic. These findings highlight the potential of FolAI as a controllable and modular solution for scalable, high-quality Foley sound synthesis in professional and interactive settings. Supplementary materials are accessible on our dedicated demo page at https://ispamm.github.io/FolAI.</p></details> |  |

Often, the input is time-evolving, shifting the goal to tracking the evolution of the underlying patterns instead. To adapt to this more complex setting, existing methods incorporate temporal regularization but they either have overly constrained structural requirements or lack uniqueness which is crucial for interpretation. In this paper, in order to capture the underlying evolving patterns, we introduce t(emporal)PARAFAC2, which utilizes temporal smoothness regularization on the evolving factors. Previously, Alternating Optimization (AO) and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithmic approach has been introduced to fit the PARAFAC2 model to fully observed data. In this paper, we extend this algorithmic framework to the case of partially observed data and use it to fit the tPARAFAC2 model to complete and incomplete datasets with the goal of revealing evolving patterns. Our numerical experiments on simulated datasets demonstrate that tPARAFAC2 can extract the underlying evolving patterns more accurately compared to the state-of-the-art in the presence of high amounts of noise and missing data. Using two real datasets, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithmic approach in terms of handling missing data and tPARAFAC2 model in terms of revealing evolving patterns. The paper provides an extensive comparison of different approaches for handling missing data within the proposed framework, and discusses both the advantages and limitations of tPARAFAC2 model.</p></details> | 16 pages, 15 figures |

This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal error estimates of a second-order temporally finite element method for electrohydrodynamic equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02345v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we mainly present the optimal convergence rates of the temporally second-order finite element scheme for solving the electrohydrodynamic equation. Suffering from the highly coupled nonlinearity, the convergence analysis of the numerical schemes for such a system is rather rare, not to mention the optimal error estimates for the high-order temporally scheme. To this end, we abandon the traditional error analysis method following the process of energy estimate, which may lead to the loss of accuracy. Instead, we note that the charge density also possesses the "energy" decaying property directly derived by its governing equation, although it does not appear in the energy stability analysis. This fact allows us to control the error terms of the charge density more conveniently, which finally leads to the optimal convergence rates. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the theoretical results, including the energy stability, mass conservation, and convergence rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16310v4)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.5\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

In particular, the recurrent-based VSR model exploits long-range temporal information during inference and achieves superior detail restoration. However, effectively learning these long-term dependencies within long videos remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose LRTI-VSR, a novel training framework for recurrent VSR that efficiently leverages Long-Range Refocused Temporal Information. Our framework includes a generic training strategy that utilizes temporal propagation features from long video clips while training on shorter video clips. Additionally, we introduce a refocused intra&inter-frame transformer block which allows the VSR model to selectively prioritize useful temporal information through its attention module while further improving inter-frame information utilization in the FFN module. We evaluate LRTI-VSR on both CNN and transformer-based VSR architectures, conducting extensive ablation studies to validate the contribution of each component. Experiments on long-video test sets demonstrate that LRTI-VSR achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining training and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/jegp/nrf</p></details> |

Existing methods usually focus on implicitly modeling audio and visual features through weak labels, without mining semantic relationships for different modalities and explicit modeling of event temporal dependencies. This makes it difficult for the model to accurately parse event information for each segment under weak supervision, especially when high similarity between segmental modal features leads to ambiguous event boundaries. Hence, we propose a multimodal optimization framework, TeMTG, that combines text enhancement and multi-hop temporal graph modeling. Specifically, we leverage pre-trained multimodal models to generate modality-specific text embeddings, and fuse them with audio-visual features to enhance the semantic representation of these features. In addition, we introduce a multi-hop temporal graph neural network, which explicitly models the local temporal relationships between segments, capturing the temporal continuity of both short-term and long-range events. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators in the LLP dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICMR 2025</p></details> |

However, the state-of-the-art NN-models are typically computational expensive and they leverage longer sequences of sparse tracking inputs to generate full-body movements by capturing temporal context. Inevitably, longer sequences increase the computation overhead and introduce noise in longer temporal dependencies that adversely affect the generation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-based method that enhances the overall performance while balancing the computational cost and memory overhead for efficient 3D full-body generation. Precisely, we introduce a NN-mechanism that divides the longer sequence of inputs into smaller temporal windows. Later, the current motion is merged with the information from these windows through latent representations to utilize the past context for the generation. Our experiments demonstrate that generation accuracy of our method with this NN-mechanism is significantly improved compared to the state-of-the-art methods while greatly reducing computational costs and memory overhead, making our method suitable for resource-constrained devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPRW2025 - 4D Vision Workshop</p></details> |

Existing methods either compress video tokens to reduce temporal resolution, or treat videos as unsegmented streams, which obscures fine-grained event boundaries and limits the modeling of causal dependencies. We propose TEMPURA (Temporal Event Masked Prediction and Understanding for Reasoning in Action), a two-stage training framework that enhances video temporal understanding. TEMPURA first applies masked event prediction reasoning to reconstruct missing events and generate step-by-step causal explanations from dense event annotations, drawing inspiration from effective infilling techniques. TEMPURA then learns to perform video segmentation and dense captioning to decompose videos into non-overlapping events with detailed, timestamp-aligned descriptions. We train TEMPURA on VER, a large-scale dataset curated by us that comprises 1M training instances and 500K videos with temporally aligned event descriptions and structured reasoning steps. Experiments on temporal grounding and highlight detection benchmarks demonstrate that TEMPURA outperforms strong baseline models, confirming that integrating causal reasoning with fine-grained temporal segmentation leads to improved video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIDSTAMP: A Temporally-Aware Watermark for Ownership and Integrity in Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01406v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid rise of video diffusion models has enabled the generation of highly realistic and temporally coherent videos, raising critical concerns about content authenticity, provenance, and misuse. Existing watermarking approaches, whether passive, post-hoc, or adapted from image-based techniques, often struggle to withstand video-specific manipulations such as frame insertion, dropping, or reordering, and typically degrade visual quality. In this work, we introduce VIDSTAMP, a watermarking framework that embeds per-frame or per-segment messages directly into the latent space of temporally-aware video diffusion models. By fine-tuning the model's decoder through a two-stage pipeline, first on static image datasets to promote spatial message separation, and then on synthesized video sequences to restore temporal consistency, VIDSTAMP learns to embed high-capacity, flexible watermarks with minimal perceptual impact. Leveraging architectural components such as 3D convolutions and temporal attention, our method imposes no additional inference cost and offers better perceptual quality than prior methods, while maintaining comparable robustness against common distortions and tampering. VIDSTAMP embeds 768 bits per video (48 bits per frame) with a bit accuracy of 95.0%, achieves a log P-value of -166.65 (lower is better), and maintains a video quality score of 0.836, comparable to unwatermarked outputs (0.838) and surpassing prior methods in capacity-quality tradeoffs.

| **[Stabilizing Temporal Difference Learning via Implicit Stochastic Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01361v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Difference (TD) learning is a foundational algorithm in reinforcement learning (RL). For nearly forty years, TD learning has served as a workhorse for applied RL as well as a building block for more complex and specialized algorithms. However, despite its widespread use, it is not without drawbacks, the most prominent being its sensitivity to step size. A poor choice of step size can dramatically inflate the error of value estimates and slow convergence. Consequently, in practice, researchers must use trial and error in order to identify a suitable step size -- a process that can be tedious and time consuming. As an alternative, we propose implicit TD algorithms that reformulate TD updates into fixed-point equations. These updates are more stable and less sensitive to step size without sacrificing computational efficiency. Moreover, our theoretical analysis establishes asymptotic convergence guarantees and finite-time error bounds. Our results demonstrate their robustness and practicality for modern RL tasks, establishing implicit TD as a versatile tool for policy evaluation and value approximation.</p></details> |  |

Although existing benchmarks address a system's ability to reason about and resolve temporal references, systematic evaluation of specific temporal references remains limited. Towards closing this gap, we introduce TRAVELER, a novel synthetic benchmark dataset that follows a Question Answering paradigm and consists of questions involving temporal references with the corresponding correct answers. TRAVELER assesses models' abilities to resolve explicit, implicit relative to speech time, and vague temporal references. Beyond investigating the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs depending on the type of temporal reference, our benchmark also allows evaluation of performance in relation to the length of the set of events. For the category of vague temporal references, ground-truth answers were established via human surveys on Prolific, following a procedure similar to the one from Kenneweg et al. To demonstrate the benchmark's applicability, we evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs using a question-answering task encompassing 3,300 questions. Our findings show that while the benchmarked LLMs can answer questions over event sets with a handful of events and explicit temporal references successfully, performance clearly deteriorates with larger event set length and when temporal references get less explicit. Notably, the vague question category exhibits the lowest performance across all models.

In this paper, we introduce a factorized model that captures the semantics of these adverbials as probabilistic distributions. These distributions are composed with event-specific distributions to yield a contextualized meaning for an adverbial applied to a specific event. We fit the model's parameters using existing data capturing judgments of native speakers regarding the applicability of these vague temporal adverbials to events that took place a given time ago. Comparing our approach to a non-factorized model based on a single Gaussian distribution for each pair of event and temporal adverbial, we find that while both models have similar predictive power, our model is preferable in terms of Occam's razor, as it is simpler and has better extendability.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin comment: This version has been removed by arXiv administrators as the submitter did not have the rights to agree to the license at the time of submission</p></details> |

However, Transformer-based methods either ignore the spatial neighborhood relationships between the joints when used for skeleton representations or disregard the local temporal patterns of the local joint movements in skeleton sequence modeling, while GCN-based methods often neglect the need for pose-specific representations. To address these problems, we propose a new method that exploits the graph modeling capability of GCN to represent each skeleton with multiple graphs of different orders, incorporated with a newly introduced Graph Order Attention module that dynamically emphasizes the most representative orders for each joint. The resulting spatial features of the sequence are further processed using a proposed temporal Body Aware Transformer that models the global body feature dependencies in the sequence with awareness of the local inter-skeleton feature dependencies of joints. Given that our 3D pose output aligns with the central 2D pose in the sequence, we improve the self-attention mechanism to be aware of the central pose while diminishing its focus gradually towards the first and the last poses. Extensive experiments on Human3.6m, MPIINF-3DHP, and HumanEva-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conventional user profiling methods, such as averaging item embeddings, often overlook the evolving, nuanced nature of user interests, particularly the interplay between short-term and long-term preferences. In this work, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language summaries of users' interaction histories, distinguishing recent behaviors from more persistent tendencies. Our framework not only models temporal user preferences but also produces natural language profiles that can be used to explain recommendations in an interpretable manner. These textual profiles are encoded via a pre-trained model, and an attention mechanism dynamically fuses the short-term and long-term embeddings into a comprehensive user representation. Beyond boosting recommendation accuracy over multiple baselines, our approach naturally supports explainability: the interpretable text summaries and attention weights can be exposed to end users, offering insights into why specific items are suggested. Experiments on real-world datasets underscore both the performance gains and the promise of generating clearer, more transparent justifications for content-based recommendations.</p></details> |  |

Accurate predictive models rely on high-resolution spatio-temporal data to capture the complex interplay of environmental and anthropogenic factors. To address the lack of localised and fine-grained datasets in Spain, this work introduces IberFire, a spatio-temporal datacube at 1 km x 1 km x 1-day resolution covering mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands from December 2007 to December 2024. IberFire integrates 260 features across eight main categories: auxiliary features, fire history, geography, topography, meteorology, vegetation indices, human activity, and land cover. All features are derived from open-access sources, ensuring transparency and real-time applicability. The data processing pipeline was implemented entirely using open-source tools, and the codebase has been made publicly available. This work not only enhances spatio-temporal granularity and feature diversity compared to existing European datacubes but also provides a reproducible methodology for constructing similar datasets. IberFire supports advanced wildfire risk modelling through Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, enables climate pattern analysis and informs strategic planning in fire prevention and land management. The dataset is publicly available on Zenodo to promote open research and collaboration.</p></details> |  |

The general-purpose MIMIC-IV-Note pose specific challenges for our work: it turns out that the discharge summaries are too lengthy for typical natural language models to process, and the clinical events of interest often are not accompanied with explicit timestamps. Therefore, we propose a new framework that works as follows: 1) we break each discharge summary into manageably small text chunks; 2) we apply contextual BM25 and contextual semantic search to retrieve chunks that have a high potential of containing clinical events; and 3) we carefully design prompts to teach the recently released Llama-3.1-8B \cite{touvron2023llama} model to identify or infer temporal information of the chunks. We show that the obtained dataset is so informative and transparent that standard models fine-tuned on our dataset are achieving significant improvements in healthcare applications. In particular, the BERT model fine-tuned based on our dataset achieves 10\% improvement in accuracy on medical question answering task, and 3\% improvement in clinical trial matching task compared with the classic BERT. The GPT-2 model, fine-tuned on our dataset, produces more clinically reliable results for clinical questions.</p></details> |  |

However, most previous works only consider fixed or parametrized STL specifications due to the lack of a diverse STL dataset and encoders to effectively extract temporal logic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose TeLoGraF, Temporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow, which utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) encoder and flow-matching to learn solutions for general STL specifications. We identify four commonly used STL templates and collect a total of 200K specifications with paired demonstrations. We conduct extensive experiments in five simulation environments ranging from simple dynamical models in the 2D space to high-dimensional 7DoF Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped navigation. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines in the STL satisfaction rate. Compared to classical STL planning algorithms, our approach is 10-100X faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics. Besides, we show our graph-encoding method's capability to solve complex STLs and robustness to out-distribution STL specifications.

The outputs of such systems vary not only with physical parameters but also with external time-varying input signals. Accurately catching the dynamics of such systems is challenging. We have adapted and extended an existing transformer model for single output prediction to a multiple-output transformer that is able to predict multiple output responses of these systems. The multiple-output transformer generalizes the interpretability of the original transformer. The generalized interpretable attention weight matrix explores not only the temporal correlations in the sequence, but also the interactions between the multiple outputs, providing explanation for the spatial correlation in the output domain. This multiple-output transformer accurately predicts the sequence of multiple outputs, regardless of the nonlinearity of the system and the dimensionality of the parameter space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Human Actions in the Digital Platform by Temporal Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09535v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in digital platforms generate rich, high-dimensional logs of human behavior, and machine learning models have helped social scientists explain knowledge accumulation, communication, and information diffusion. Such models, however, almost always treat behavior as sequences of actions, abstracting the inter-temporal information among actions. To close this gap, we introduce a two-scale Action-Timing Context(ATC) framework that jointly embeds each action and its time interval. ATC obtains low-dimensional representations of actions and characterizes them with inter-temporal information. We provide three applications of ATC to real-world datasets and demonstrate that the method offers a unified view of human behavior. The presented qualitative findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling inter-temporal context is essential for a comprehensive, interpretable understanding of human activity on digital platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepSTA: A Spatial-Temporal Attention Network for Logistics Delivery Timely Rate Prediction in Anomaly Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00402v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prediction of couriers' delivery timely rates in advance is essential to the logistics industry, enabling companies to take preemptive measures to ensure the normal operation of delivery services. This becomes even more critical during anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers' delivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly. Existing studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many works focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly model abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other features, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous events occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in these scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal attention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we design an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent neural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec to model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks and long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of couriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal circumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a memory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention mechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by 12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over multiple competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2023</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Neural Video Representation with Temporally Coherent Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00335v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implicit neural representations (INR) has found successful applications across diverse domains. To employ INR in real-life, it is important to speed up training. In the field of INR for video applications, the state-of-the-art approach employs grid-type parametric encoding and successfully achieves a faster encoding speed in comparison to its predecessors. However, the grid usage, which does not consider the video's dynamic nature, leads to redundant use of trainable parameters. As a result, it has significantly lower parameter efficiency and higher bitrate compared to NeRV-style methods that do not use a parametric encoding. To address the problem, we propose Neural Video representation with Temporally coherent Modulation (NVTM), a novel framework that can capture dynamic characteristics of video. By decomposing the spatio-temporal 3D video data into a set of 2D grids with flow information, NVTM enables learning video representation rapidly and uses parameter efficiently. Our framework enables to process temporally corresponding pixels at once, resulting in the fastest encoding speed for a reasonable video quality, especially when compared to the NeRV-style method, with a speed increase of over 3 times. Also, it remarks an average of 1.54dB/0.019 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on UVG (Dynamic) (even with 10% fewer parameters) and an average of 1.84dB/0.013 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on MCL-JCV (Dynamic), compared to previous grid-type works. By expanding this to compression tasks, we demonstrate comparable performance to video compression standards (H.264, HEVC) and recent INR approaches for video compression. Additionally, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithm across diverse tasks, encompassing super resolution, frame interpolation and video inpainting.

The primary aim of the paper is to construct the spatiotemporal tube (STT) using a sampling-based approach and thereby devise a closed-form approximation-free control strategy to ensure that system trajectory reaches the target set while avoiding time-dependent unsafe sets. The proposed scheme utilizes a novel method involving STTs to provide controllers that guarantee both system safety and reachability. In our sampling-based framework, we translate the requirements of STTs into a Robust optimization program (ROP). To address the infeasibility of ROP caused by infinite constraints, we utilize the sampling-based Scenario optimization program (SOP). Subsequently, we solve the SOP to generate the tube and closed-form controller for an unknown system, ensuring the temporal reach-avoid-stay specification. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through three case studies: an omnidirectional robot, a SCARA manipulator, and a magnetic levitation system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Attention Evolutional Graph Convolutional Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00302v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting enables the prediction of future states by leveraging historical data, thereby facilitating decision-making processes. Each data node in a multivariate time series encompasses a sequence of multiple dimensions. These nodes exhibit interdependent relationships, forming a graph structure. While existing prediction methods often assume a fixed graph structure, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic graph structures. Moreover, interactions among time series observed at different time scales vary significantly. To enhance prediction accuracy by capturing precise temporal and spatial features, this paper introduces the Temporal Attention Evolutional Graph Convolutional Network (TAEGCN). This novel method not only integrates causal temporal convolution and a multi-head self-attention mechanism to learn temporal features of nodes, but also construct the dynamic graph structure based on these temporal features to keep the consistency of the changing in spatial feature with temporal series. TAEGCN adeptly captures temporal causal relationships and hidden spatial dependencies within the data. Furthermore, TAEGCN incorporates a unified neural network that seamlessly integrates these components to generate final predictions. Experimental results conducted on two public transportation network datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

Despite long-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and accurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and random shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal Perception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical motion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in an end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to capture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained perception progressively refines the object-level features using previous outputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation. Because there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation, we manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on GasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such as gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, ICIP 2025 Conference</p></details> |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Generation of Explanations for Robot Policies with Weighted Signal Temporal Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21841v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network-based policies have demonstrated success in many robotic applications, but often lack human-explanability, which poses challenges in safety-critical deployments. To address this, we propose a neuro-symbolic explanation framework that generates a weighted signal temporal logic (wSTL) specification to describe a robot policy in a interpretable form. Existing methods typically produce explanations that are verbose and inconsistent, which hinders explainability, and loose, which do not give meaningful insights into the underlying policy. We address these issues by introducing a simplification process consisting of predicate filtering, regularization, and iterative pruning. We also introduce three novel explainability evaluation metrics -- conciseness, consistency, and strictness -- to assess explanation quality beyond conventional classification metrics. Our method is validated in three simulated robotic environments, where it outperforms baselines in generating concise, consistent, and strict wSTL explanations without sacrificing classification accuracy. This work bridges policy learning with formal methods, contributing to safer and more transparent decision-making in robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting clinical outcomes from patient care pathways represented with temporal knowledge graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21138v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: With the increasing availability of healthcare data, predictive modeling finds many applications in the biomedical domain, such as the evaluation of the level of risk for various conditions, which in turn can guide clinical decision making. However, it is unclear how knowledge graph data representations and their embedding, which are competitive in some settings, could be of interest in biomedical predictive modeling. Method: We simulated synthetic but realistic data of patients with intracranial aneurysm and experimented on the task of predicting their clinical outcome. We compared the performance of various classification approaches on tabular data versus a graph-based representation of the same data. Next, we investigated how the adopted schema for representing first individual data and second temporal data impacts predictive performances. Results: Our study illustrates that in our case, a graph representation and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) embeddings reach the best performance for a predictive task from observational data. We emphasize the importance of the adopted schema and of the consideration of literal values in the representation of individual data. Our study also moderates the relative impact of various time encoding on GCN performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Historically Relevant Event Structuring for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10621v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning focuses on predicting events through historical information within snapshots distributed on a timeline. Existing studies mainly concentrate on two perspectives of leveraging the history of TKGs, including capturing evolution of each recent snapshot or correlations among global historical facts. Despite the achieved significant accomplishments, these models still fall short of I) investigating the impact of multi-granular interactions across recent snapshots, and II) harnessing the expressive semantics of significant links accorded with queries throughout the entire history, particularly events exerting a profound impact on the future. These inadequacies restrict representation ability to reflect historical dependencies and future trends thoroughly. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an innovative TKG reasoning approach towards \textbf{His}torically \textbf{R}elevant \textbf{E}vents \textbf{S}tructuring (HisRES). Concretely, HisRES comprises two distinctive modules excelling in structuring historically relevant events within TKGs, including a multi-granularity evolutionary encoder that captures structural and temporal dependencies of the most recent snapshots, and a global relevance encoder that concentrates on crucial correlations among events relevant to queries from the entire history. Furthermore, HisRES incorporates a self-gating mechanism for adaptively merging multi-granularity recent and historically relevant structuring representations. Extensive experiments on four event-based benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of HisRES and indicate the superiority and effectiveness of structuring historical relevance for TKG reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2025, 12 pages</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Pseudo-Label Guided Learning for Weakly Supervised Temporal Action Localization from the Perspective of Noise Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11124v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pseudo-label learning methods have been widely applied in weakly-supervised temporal action localization. Existing works directly utilize weakly-supervised base model to generate instance-level pseudo-labels for training the fully-supervised detection head. We argue that the noise in pseudo-labels would interfere with the learning of fully-supervised detection head, leading to significant performance leakage. Issues with noisy labels include:(1) inaccurate boundary localization; (2) undetected short action clips; (3) multiple adjacent segments incorrectly detected as one segment. To target these issues, we introduce a two-stage noisy label learning strategy to harness every potential useful signal in noisy labels. First, we propose a frame-level pseudo-label generation model with a context-aware denoising algorithm to refine the boundaries. Second, we introduce an online-revised teacher-student framework with a missing instance compensation module and an ambiguous instance correction module to solve the short-action-missing and many-to-one problems. Besides, we apply a high-quality pseudo-label mining loss in our online-revised teacher-student framework to add different weights to the noisy labels to train more effectively. Our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method in detection accuracy and inference speed greatly upon the THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.2 benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoSAM: Motion-Guided Segment Anything Model with Spatial-Temporal Memory Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00739v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in interactive object segmentation for both images and videos. However, as a foundational model on interactive segmentation, SAM2 performs segmentation directly based on mask memory from the past six frames, leading to two significant challenges. Firstly, during inference in videos, objects may disappear since SAM2 relies solely on memory without accounting for object motion information, which limits its long-range object tracking capabilities. Secondly, its memory is constructed from fixed past frames, making it susceptible to challenges associated with object disappearance or occlusion, due to potentially inaccurate segmentation results in memory. To address these problems, we present MoSAM, incorporating two key strategies to integrate object motion cues into the model and establish more reliable feature memory. Firstly, we propose Motion-Guided Prompting (MGP), which represents the object motion in both sparse and dense manners, then injects them into SAM2 through a set of motion-guided prompts. MGP enables the model to adjust its focus towards the direction of motion, thereby enhancing the object tracking capabilities. Furthermore, acknowledging that past segmentation results may be inaccurate, we devise a Spatial-Temporal Memory Selection (ST-MS) mechanism that dynamically identifies frames likely to contain accurate segmentation in both pixel- and frame-level. By eliminating potentially inaccurate mask predictions from memory, we can leverage more reliable memory features to exploit similar regions for improving segmentation results. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks of video object segmentation and video instance segmentation demonstrate that our MoSAM achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other competitors.</p></details> |  |
| **[BOPIM: Bayesian Optimization for influence maximization on temporal networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04700v4)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of influence maximization (IM) is to select a small set of seed nodes which maximizes the spread of influence on a network. In this work, we propose BOPIM, a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm for IM on temporal networks. The IM task is well-suited for a BO solution due to its expensive and complicated objective function. There are at least two key challenges, however, that must be overcome, primarily due to the inputs coming from a cardinality-constrained, non-Euclidean, combinatorial space. The first is constructing the kernel function for the Gaussian Process regression. We propose two kernels, one based on the Hamming distance between seed sets and the other leveraging the Jaccard coefficient between node's neighbors. The second challenge is the acquisition function. For this, we use the Expected Improvement function, suitably adjusting for noise in the observations, and optimize it using a greedy algorithm to account for the cardinality constraint. In numerical experiments on real-world networks, we prove that BOPIM outperforms competing methods and yields comparable influence spreads to a gold-standard greedy algorithm while being as much as ten times faster. In addition, we find that the Hamming kernel performs favorably compared to the Jaccard kernel in nearly all settings, a somewhat surprising result as the former does not explicitly account for the graph structure. Finally, we demonstrate two ways that the proposed method can quantify uncertainty in optimal seed sets. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to look at uncertainty in the seed sets for IM.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore various modeling approaches for FCO detections within microscopic traffic simulations to evaluate their potential for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. These approaches range from 2D raytracing to high-fidelity co-simulations that emulate real-world sensors and integrate 3D object detection algorithms to closely replicate FCO detections. Additionally, we introduce a neural network-based emulation technique that effectively approximates the results of high-fidelity co-simulations. This approach captures the unique characteristics of FCO detections while offering a fast and scalable solution for modeling. Using this emulation method, we investigate the impact of FCO data in a digital twin of a traffic network modeled in SUMO. Results demonstrate that even at a 20% penetration rate, FCOs using LiDAR-based detections can identify 65% of vehicles across various intersections and traffic demand scenarios. Further potential emerges when temporal insights are integrated, enabling the recovery of previously detected but currently unseen vehicles. By employing data-driven methods, we recover over 80% of these vehicles with minimal positional deviations. These findings underscore the potential of FCOs for ITS, particularly in enhancing traffic state estimation and monitoring under varying penetration rates and traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Temporal Logic Task and Motion Planning for Multi-Robot Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18899v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task and motion planning (TAMP) for multi-robot systems, which integrates discrete task planning with continuous motion planning, remains a challenging problem in robotics. Existing TAMP approaches often struggle to scale effectively for multi-robot systems with complex specifications, leading to infeasible solutions and prolonged computation times. This work addresses the TAMP problem in multi-robot settings where tasks are specified using expressive hierarchical temporal logic and task assignments are not pre-determined. Our approach leverages the efficiency of hierarchical temporal logic specifications for task-level planning and the optimization-based graph of convex sets method for motion-level planning, integrating them within a product graph framework. At the task level, we convert hierarchical temporal logic specifications into a single graph, embedding task allocation within its edges. At the motion level, we represent the feasible motions of multiple robots through convex sets in the configuration space, guided by a sampling-based motion planner. This formulation allows us to define the TAMP problem as a shortest path search within the product graph, where efficient convex optimization techniques can be applied. We prove that our approach is both sound and complete under mild assumptions. Additionally, we extend our framework to cooperative pick-and-place tasks involving object handovers between robots. We evaluate our method across various high-dimensional multi-robot scenarios, including simulated and real-world environments with quadrupeds, robotic arms, and automated conveyor systems. Our results show that our approach outperforms existing methods in execution time and solution optimality while effectively scaling with task complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS 2025)</p></details> |

Quantum-Train (QT), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages quantum neural networks (QNNs) to generate trainable parameters exclusively during training, eliminating the need for quantum hardware at inference time. Building on QT's success across multiple domains, including image classification, reinforcement learning, flood prediction, and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, we introduce Quantum Parameter Adaptation (QPA) for efficient typhoon forecasting model learning. Integrated with an Attention-based Multi-ConvGRU model, QPA enables parameter-efficient training while maintaining predictive accuracy. This work represents the first application of quantum machine learning (QML) to large-scale typhoon trajectory prediction, offering a scalable and energy-efficient approach to climate modeling. Our results demonstrate that QPA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving performance, making high-performance forecasting more accessible and sustainable through hybrid quantum-classical learning.</p></details> |  |

While modern Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can handle diverse robotic tasks, they often incur high per-step inference costs, resulting in significant latency, sometimes minutes per task. In contrast, RT-cache stores a large-scale Memory of previously successful robot trajectories and retrieves relevant multistep motion snippets, drastically reducing inference overhead. By integrating a Memory Builder with a Trajectory Retrieval, we develop an efficient retrieval process that remains tractable even for extremely large datasets. RT-cache flexibly accumulates real-world experiences and replays them whenever the current scene matches past states, adapting quickly to new or unseen environments with only a few additional samples. Experiments on the Open-X Embodiment Dataset and other real-world data demonstrate that RT-cache completes tasks both faster and more successfully than a baseline lacking retrieval, suggesting a practical, data-driven solution for real-time manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures.

| **[DiffOG: Differentiable Policy Trajectory Optimization with Generalizability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13807v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning-based visuomotor policies excel at manipulation tasks but often produce suboptimal action trajectories compared to model-based methods. Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. DiffOG refines action trajectories to be smoother and more constraint-compliant while maintaining alignment with the original demonstration distribution, thus avoiding degradation in policy performance. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy.

The key idea is to capture each task by an object-centric representation, specifically the SE(3) object pose trajectory relative to the target. This approach decouples embodiment actions from sensory inputs, facilitating learning from various demonstration types, including both action-based and action-less human hand demonstrations, as well as cross-embodiment generalization. Additionally, object pose trajectories inherently capture planning constraints from demonstrations without the need for manually-crafted rules. To guide the robot in executing the task, the object trajectory is used to condition a diffusion policy. We systematically evaluate our method on simulation and real-world tasks. In real-world evaluation, using only eight demonstrations shot on an iPhone, our approach completed all tasks while fully complying with task constraints.

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates.

However, existing methods often struggle to accurately capture this intricate structure from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data, particularly due to the lack of ground truth labels and the ambiguous, intertwined nature of fiber trajectories. We present a novel deep learning framework for unsupervised clustering of myocardial fibers, providing a data-driven approach to identifying distinct fiber bundles. We uniquely combine a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to capture local sequential information along fibers, with a Transformer autoencoder to learn global shape features, with pointwise incorporation of essential anatomical context. Clustering these representations using a density-based algorithm identifies 33 to 62 robust clusters, successfully capturing the subtle distinctions in fiber trajectories with varying levels of granularity. Our framework offers a new, flexible, and quantitative way to analyze myocardial structure, achieving a level of delineation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously achieved, with potential applications in improving surgical planning, characterizing disease-related remodeling, and ultimately, advancing personalized cardiac care.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Optimal Trajectory Planning with Collision Avoidance for Autonomous Vehicle Maneuvering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08724v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To perform autonomous driving maneuvers, such as parallel or perpendicular parking, a vehicle requires continual speed and steering adjustments to follow a generated path. In consequence, the path's quality is a limiting factor of the vehicle maneuver's performance. While most path planning approaches include finding a collision-free route, optimal trajectory planning involves solving the best transition from initial to final states, minimizing the action over all paths permitted by a kinematic model. Here we propose a novel method based on sequential convex optimization, which permits flexible and efficient optimal trajectory generation. The objective is to achieve the fastest time, shortest distance, and fewest number of path segments to satisfy motion requirements, while avoiding sensor blind-spots. In our approach, vehicle kinematics are represented by a discretized Dubins model. To avoid collisions, each waypoint is constrained by linear inequalities representing closest distance of obstacles to a polygon specifying the vehicle's extent. To promote smooth and valid trajectories, the solved kinematic state and control variables are constrained and regularized by penalty terms in the model's cost function, which enforces physical restrictions including limits for steering angle, acceleration and speed. In this paper, we analyze trajectories obtained for several parking scenarios. Results demonstrate efficient and collision-free motion generated by the proposed technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIAM ...</summary><p>SIAM Conference on Control and Its Applications, July 28-30th, 2025, Montreal, Canada</p></details> |

This paper presents a distributed trajectory planning algorithm for a quadrotor swarm that operates asynchronously and requires no communication except during the initial planning phase. Moreover, our algorithm guarantees no deadlock under asynchronous updates and absence of communication during flight. To effectively ensure these points, we build two main modules: coordination state updater and trajectory optimizer. The coordination state updater computes waypoints for each agent toward its goal and performs subgoal optimization while considering deadlocks, as well as safety constraints with respect to neighbor agents and obstacles. Then, the trajectory optimizer generates a trajectory that ensures collision avoidance even with the asynchronous planning updates of neighboring agents. We provide a theoretical guarantee of collision avoidance with deadlock resolution and evaluate the effectiveness of our method in complex simulation environments, including random forests and narrow-gap mazes. Additionally, to reduce the total mission time, we design a faster coordination state update using lightweight communication. Lastly, our approach is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments with cluttered environment scenarios.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

However, a key challenge in such approaches lies in selecting an appropriate masking strategy. Previous studies have explored predefined masking techniques, including random and tube-based masking, as well as approaches that leverage key motion priors, optical flow and semantic cues from externally pre-trained models. In this work, we introduce a novel and generalizable Trajectory-Aware Adaptive Token Sampler (TATS), which models the motion dynamics of tokens and can be seamlessly integrated into the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework to select motion-centric tokens in videos. Additionally, we propose a unified training strategy that enables joint optimization of both MAE and TATS from scratch using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We show that our model allows for aggressive masking without compromising performance on the downstream task of action recognition while also ensuring that the pre-training remains memory efficient. Extensive experiments of the proposed approach across four benchmarks, including Something-Something v2, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, generalization, and efficiency of our work compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the spatial information encoded in 3DGS, this work proposes FOCI (Field Overlap Collision Integral), an algorithm that is able to optimize trajectories directly on the Gaussians themselves. FOCI leverages a novel and interpretable collision formulation for 3DGS using the notion of the overlap integral between Gaussians. Contrary to other approaches, which represent the robot with conservative bounding boxes that underestimate the traversability of the environment, we propose to represent the environment and the robot as Gaussian Splats. This not only has desirable computational properties, but also allows for orientation-aware planning, allowing the robot to pass through very tight and narrow spaces. We extensively test our algorithm in both synthetic and real Gaussian Splats, showcasing that collision-free trajectories for the ANYmal legged robot that can be computed in a few seconds, even with hundreds of thousands of Gaussians making up the environment.

| **[UVTM: Universal Vehicle Trajectory Modeling with ST Feature Domain Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07232v4)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle movement is frequently captured in the form of GPS trajectories, i.e., sequences of timestamped GPS locations. Such data is widely used for various tasks such as travel-time estimation, trajectory recovery, and trajectory prediction. A universal vehicle trajectory model could be applied to different tasks, removing the need to maintain multiple specialized models, thereby reducing computational and storage costs. However, creating such a model is challenging when the integrity of trajectory features is compromised, i.e., in scenarios where only partial features are available or the trajectories are sparse. To address these challenges, we propose the Universal Vehicle Trajectory Model (UVTM), which can effectively adapt to different tasks without excessive retraining. UVTM incorporates two specialized designs. First, it divides trajectory features into three distinct domains. Each domain can be masked and generated independently to accommodate tasks with only partially available features. Second, UVTM is pre-trained by reconstructing dense, feature-complete trajectories from sparse, feature-incomplete counterparts, enabling strong performance even when the integrity of trajectory features is compromised. Experiments involving four representative trajectory-related tasks on three real-world vehicle trajectory datasets provide insight into the performance of UVTM and offer evidence that it is capable of meeting its objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACT-R: Adaptive Camera Trajectories for 3D Reconstruction from Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08239v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce adaptive view planning to multi-view synthesis, aiming to improve both occlusion revelation and 3D consistency for single-view 3D reconstruction. Instead of generating an unordered set of views independently or simultaneously, we generate a sequence of views, leveraging temporal consistency to enhance 3D coherence. Most importantly, our view sequence is not determined by a pre-determined camera setup. Instead, we compute an adaptive camera trajectory (ACT), specifically, an orbit of camera views, which maximizes the visibility of occluded regions of the 3D object to be reconstructed. Once the best orbit is found, we feed it to a video diffusion model to generate novel views around the orbit, which in turn, are passed to a multi-view 3D reconstruction model to obtain the final reconstruction. Our multi-view synthesis pipeline is quite efficient since it involves no run-time training/optimization, only forward inferences by applying the pre-trained models for occlusion analysis and multi-view synthesis. Our method predicts camera trajectories that reveal occlusions effectively and produce consistent novel views, significantly improving 3D reconstruction over SOTA on the unseen GSO dataset, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes a novel graph-based approach for floor separation using Wi-Fi fingerprint trajectories, addressing the challenge of vertical localization in indoor settings. We construct a graph where nodes represent Wi-Fi fingerprints, and edges are weighted by signal similarity and contextual transitions. Node2Vec is employed to generate low-dimensional embeddings, which are subsequently clustered using K-means to identify distinct floors. Evaluated on the Huawei University Challenge 2021 dataset, our method outperforms traditional community detection algorithms, achieving an accuracy of 68.97%, an F1- score of 61.99%, and an Adjusted Rand Index of 57.19%. By publicly releasing the preprocessed dataset and implementation code, this work contributes to advancing research in indoor positioning. The proposed approach demonstrates robustness to signal noise and architectural complexities, offering a scalable solution for floor-level localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Trajectory Stitching with Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07802v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have shown great promise as trajectory planners, given their affinity to modeling complex distributions and guidable inference process. Previous works have successfully applied these in the context of robotic manipulation but perform poorly when the required solution does not exist as a complete trajectory within the training set. We identify that this is a result of being unable to plan via stitching, and subsequently address the architectural and dataset choices needed to remedy this. On top of this, we propose a novel addition to the training and inference procedures to both stabilize and enhance these capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating plans with out of distribution boundary conditions and performing obstacle avoidance on the Franka Panda in simulation and on real hardware. In both of these tasks our method performs significantly better than the baselines and is able to avoid obstacles up to four times as large.</p></details> |  |

However, comprehensive datasets that capture real-world career trajectories are scarce. In this paper, we introduce JobHop, a large-scale public dataset derived from anonymized resumes provided by VDAB, the public employment service in Flanders, Belgium. Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), we process unstructured resume data to extract structured career information, which is then mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes using a multi-label classification model. This results in a rich dataset of over 2.3 million work experiences, extracted from and grouped into more than 391,000 user resumes and mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes, offering valuable insights into real-world occupational transitions. This dataset enables diverse applications, such as analyzing labor market mobility, job stability, and the effects of career breaks on occupational transitions. It also supports career path prediction and other data-driven decision-making processes. To illustrate its potential, we explore key dataset characteristics, including job distributions, career breaks, and job transitions, demonstrating its value for advancing labor market research.</p></details> |  |
| **[SICNav-Diffusion: Safe and Interactive Crowd Navigation with Diffusion Trajectory Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08858v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To navigate crowds without collisions, robots must interact with humans by forecasting their future motion and reacting accordingly. While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite-Alphabet-Aware Trajectory and Precoder Optimization for UAV Relaying](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08680v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become key enablers in relay-assisted wireless communications thanks to their flexibility and line-of-sight channel advantage. However, most existing trajectory optimization frameworks assume ideal Gaussian inputs, overlooking the fact that practical wireless systems rely on structured, finite-alphabet constellations. This mismatch can lead to suboptimal, and sometimes misleading, design choices. In this paper, we challenge that convention by introducing a finite-alphabet-aware framework for joint trajectory and precoder optimization in UAV-assisted relay systems. We formulate a non-convex design problem that directly accounts for discrete signal structures and propose an efficient solution based on alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Simulation results reveal that strategies optimized under Gaussian assumptions can waste energy and degrade throughput in real deployments. In contrast, our approach adapts both the UAV's trajectory and transmission strategy to the underlying modulation format, delivering consistent performance gains under practical system constraints. This work takes a key step toward aligning UAV communication design with the realities of modern wireless systems: discrete signals, power limits, and intelligent mobility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jointly spatial-temporal representation learning for individual trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04055v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual trajectories, rich in human-environment interaction information across space and time, serve as vital inputs for geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs). However, existing attempts at learning trajectory representations have overlooked the implicit spatial-temporal dependency within trajectories, failing to encode such dependency in a deep learning-friendly format. That poses a challenge in obtaining general-purpose trajectory representations. Therefore, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal joint representation learning method (ST-GraphRL) to formalize learnable spatial-temporal dependencies into trajectory representations. The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a weighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility interactions in both space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage jointly encoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion), to learn entangled spatial-temporal dependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating space and time information; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn explicit mobility regularities by simulating the spatial-temporal distributions of trajectories. Tested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed ST-GraphRL outperformed all the baseline models in predicting movement spatial-temporal distributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal correlations. Analyzing spatial-temporal features presented in latent space validates that ST-GraphRL understands spatial-temporal patterns. This study may also benefit representation learnings of other geospatial data to achieve general-purpose data representations and advance GeoFMs development.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 3 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

The challenge is to compute near-optimal sensor placements for detecting targets whose trajectories follow a log-Gaussian Cox line process. We explore sensor deployment in a transformed space, where linear target trajectories are represented as points. While this space simplifies handling the line process, the spatial functions representing sensor performance (i.e. probability of detection) become less intuitive. To illustrate our approach, we focus on positioning sensors of the barrier coverage system on the seafloor to detect passing ships. Through numerical experiments using historical ship data, we compute sensor locations that maximize the probability all ship passing over the barrier coverage system are detected.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in IEEE SysCon 2025</p></details> |

This paper investigates the 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory and communication optimization for low-altitude air-ground cooperation systems, where mobile unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) upload data to UAVs. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to maximize the minimal sum-rate of UGVs while ensuring quality of service and navigation constraints. The proposed algorithm integrates a successive convex approximation (SCA)-penalty method for UGV-UAV scheduling, an SCA-based approach for UGV transmit power control, and a novel warm-start particle swarm optimization with cross mutation (WS-PSO-CM). The WS-PSO-CM leverages convex optimization results from a statistical channel model to initialize particle swarm, significantly improving the performance, compared with celebrated PSO-CM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a $45.8$\% higher minimal sum-rate compared to the baseline PSO-CM under the same iterations. This gain can be translated to reducing computational time by $46.7$\% of PSO-CM. Furthermore, our simulation results reveal that UAVs dynamically adjust trajectories to avoid interference by buildings, and maintain proximity to UGVs to mitigate path-loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 6 figures; submit to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Traditional data-driven models predominantly rely on statistical correlations, often overlooking the causal relationships that govern traffic behavior. In this paper, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction framework that leverages causal inference to enhance predictive robustness, generalization, and accuracy. By decomposing the environment into spatial and temporal components, our approach identifies and mitigates spurious correlations, uncovering genuine causal relationships. We also employ a progressive fusion strategy to integrate multimodal information, simulating human-like reasoning processes and enabling real-time inference. Evaluations on five real-world datasets--ApolloScape, nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD--demonstrate our model's superiority over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with improvements in key metrics such as RMSE and FDE. Our findings highlight the potential of causal reasoning to transform trajectory prediction, paving the way for robust AD systems.</p></details> |  |

However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025) for oral presentation</p></details> |
| **[Boundary-Guided Trajectory Prediction for Road Aware and Physically Feasible Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06740v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories. Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate under adversarial attacks from 66\% to just 1\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Estimation-Aware Trajectory Optimization with Set-Valued Measurement Uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09192v3)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, an optimization-based framework for generating estimation-aware trajectories is presented. In this setup, measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. Enveloping ellipsoids are employed to characterize state-dependent uncertainties with unknown distributions. The concept of regularity for set-valued output maps is then introduced, facilitating the formulation of the estimation-aware trajectory generation problem. Specifically, it is demonstrated that for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to the finite horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, estimation-aware trajectories can then be synthesized for a broad class of systems. Trajectory planning routines are also examined in this work, by which the observability measure is optimized for systems with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, representative examples in the context of trajectory planning with vision-based estimation are presented. Moreover, the paper presents estimation-aware planning for an uncooperative Target-Rendezvous problem, where an Ego-satellite employs an onboard machine learning (ML)-based estimation module to realize the rendezvous trajectory.</p></details> | 40 pages, 9 figures |

In this paper, we propose a barrier-enhanced parallel homotopic trajectory optimization (BPHTO) approach with the over-relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for real-time integrated decision-making and planning. To facilitate safety interactions between the ego vehicle (EV) and surrounding vehicles, a spatiotemporal safety module exhibiting bi-convexity is developed on the basis of barrier function. Varying barrier coefficients are adopted for different time steps in a planning horizon to account for the motion uncertainties of surrounding HVs and mitigate conservative behaviors. Additionally, we exploit the discrete characteristics of driving maneuvers to initialize nominal behavior-oriented free-end homotopic trajectories based on reachability analysis, and each trajectory is locally constrained to a specific driving maneuver while sharing the same task objectives. By leveraging the bi-convexity of the safety module and the kinematics of the EV, we formulate the BPHTO as a bi-convex optimization problem. Then constraint transcription and the over-relaxed ADMM are employed to streamline the optimization process, such that multiple trajectories are generated in real time with feasibility guarantees. Through a series of experiments, the proposed development demonstrates improved task accuracy, stability, and consistency in various traffic scenarios using synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Realistic Adversarial Attacks for Robustness Evaluation of Trajectory Prediction Models via Future State Perturbation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06134v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a key element of autonomous vehicle systems, enabling them to anticipate and react to the movements of other road users. Evaluating the robustness of prediction models against adversarial attacks is essential to ensure their reliability in real-world traffic. However, current approaches tend to focus on perturbing the past positions of surrounding agents, which can generate unrealistic scenarios and overlook critical vulnerabilities. This limitation may result in overly optimistic assessments of model performance in real-world conditions. In this work, we demonstrate that perturbing not just past but also future states of adversarial agents can uncover previously undetected weaknesses and thereby provide a more rigorous evaluation of model robustness. Our novel approach incorporates dynamic constraints and preserves tactical behaviors, enabling more effective and realistic adversarial attacks. We introduce new performance measures to assess the realism and impact of these adversarial trajectories. Testing our method on a state-of-the-art prediction model revealed significant increases in prediction errors and collision rates under adversarial conditions. Qualitative analysis further showed that our attacks can expose critical weaknesses, such as the inability of the model to detect potential collisions in what appear to be safe predictions. These results underscore the need for more comprehensive adversarial testing to better evaluate and improve the reliability of trajectory prediction models for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | 20 pages, 3 figures |

The main obstacle is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for city level large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial difficulties for road level small-scale aggregation. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales for static and interactive maps.</p></details> |  |

However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, to published in IEEE Sustech 2025</p></details> |

To tackle this, an end-to-end foot trajectory and force optimization framework (FTFOF) is proposed, which optimizes foot adhesion and detachment forces through trajectory adjustments. This framework accepts general foot trajectory constraints and user-defined parameters as input, ultimately producing an optimal single foot trajectory. It integrates three-segment $C^2$ continuous Bezier curves, tailored to various foot structures, enabling the generation of effective climbing trajectories. A dilate-based GRU predictive model establishes the relationship between foot trajectories and the corresponding foot forces. Multi-objective optimization algorithms, combined with a redundancy hierarchical strategy, identify the most suitable foot trajectory for specific tasks, thereby ensuring optimal performance across detachment force, adhesion force and vibration amplitude. Experimental validation on the quadruped climbing robot MST-M3F showed that, compared to commonly used trajectories in existing legged climbing robots, the proposed framework achieved reductions in maximum detachment force by 28 \%, vibration amplitude by 82 \%, which ensures the stable climbing of dry adhesion legged climbing robots.</p></details> |  |

However, issues such as noise and incompleteness often compromise data quality, leading to inaccurate trajectory analyses and limiting the potential of these applications. While Trajectory Data Preparation (TDP) can enhance data quality, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) they do not address data privacy concerns, particularly in federated settings where trajectory data sharing is prohibited, and (ii) they typically design task-specific models that lack generalizability across diverse TDP scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose FedTDP, a privacy-preserving and unified framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for TDP in federated environments. Specifically, we: (i) design a trajectory privacy autoencoder to secure data transmission and protect privacy, (ii) introduce a trajectory knowledge enhancer to improve model learning of TDP-related knowledge, enabling the development of TDP-oriented LLMs, and (iii) propose federated parallel optimization to enhance training efficiency by reducing data transmission and enabling parallel model training. Experiments on 6 real datasets and 10 mainstream TDP tasks demonstrate that FedTDP consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy, while recently proposed deep learning approaches suffer from computational cost, lack of explainability, and generalization issues that limit their practical adoption. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We introduce a Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to promote population diversity and a Statistics Feedback Loop allowing the LLM to analyze alternative predictions. Our evaluations show TrajEvo outperforms previous heuristic methods on the ETH-UCY datasets, and remarkably outperforms both heuristics and deep learning methods when generalizing to the unseen SDD dataset. TrajEvo represents a first step toward automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics. We make our source code publicly available to foster future research at https://github.com/ai4co/trajevo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Entropy Reinforcement Learning for Predictable and Robust Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04193v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simplicity is a critical inductive bias for designing data-driven controllers, especially when robustness is important. Despite the impressive results of deep reinforcement learning in complex control tasks, it is prone to capturing intricate and spurious correlations between observations and actions, leading to failure under slight perturbations to the environment. To tackle this problem, in this work we introduce a novel inductive bias towards simple policies in reinforcement learning. The simplicity inductive bias is introduced by minimizing the entropy of entire action trajectories, corresponding to the number of bits required to describe information in action trajectories after the agent observes state trajectories. Our reinforcement learning agent, Trajectory Entropy Reinforcement Learning, is optimized to minimize the trajectory entropy while maximizing rewards. We show that the trajectory entropy can be effectively estimated by learning a variational parameterized action prediction model, and use the prediction model to construct an information-regularized reward function. Furthermore, we construct a practical algorithm that enables the joint optimization of models, including the policy and the prediction model. Experimental evaluations on several high-dimensional locomotion tasks show that our learned policies produce more cyclical and consistent action trajectories, and achieve superior performance, and robustness to noise and dynamic changes than the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding the evolution of user preferences remains a complex challenge, particularly as their musical tastes change over time. This paper uses the dictionary learning paradigm to model user trajectories across different musical genres. We define a new framework that captures recurring patterns in genre trajectories, called pathlets, enabling the creation of comprehensible trajectory embeddings. We show that pathlet learning reveals relevant listening patterns that can be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. This work improves our understanding of users' interactions with music and opens up avenues of research into user behavior and fostering diversity in recommender systems. A dataset of 2000 user histories tagged by genre over 17 months, supplied by Deezer (a leading music streaming company), is also released with the code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Adjun...</summary><p>Adjunct Proceedings of the 33rd ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP Adjunct '25)</p></details> |

The formulation extends the prize-collecting traveling salesman problem. A tailored genetic algorithm evolves candidate solutions using a fitness function, crossover, and mutation, with constraint enforcement via a penalty method. Differential flatness and clothoid curves are employed to penalize infeasible trajectories efficiently, while the Euler spiral method ensures curvature-continuous trajectories with bounded curvature, enhancing dynamic feasibility and mitigating oscillations typical of minimum-jerk and snap parameterizations. Due to the discrete variable length optimization space, crossover is performed using a dynamic time-warping-based method and extended convex combination with projection. The algorithm's performance is validated through simulations and experiments with a ground vehicle, quadrotor, and quadruped, supported by benchmarking and time-complexity analysis.</p></details> |  |

While diffusion models have shown promise in planning, they are limited to solving tasks similar to those seen in their training data. We propose CompDiffuser, a novel generative approach that can solve new tasks by learning to compositionally stitch together shorter trajectory chunks from previously seen tasks. Our key insight is modeling the trajectory distribution by subdividing it into overlapping chunks and learning their conditional relationships through a single bidirectional diffusion model. This allows information to propagate between segments during generation, ensuring physically consistent connections. We conduct experiments on benchmark tasks of various difficulties, covering different environment sizes, agent state dimension, trajectory types, training data quality, and show that CompDiffuser significantly outperforms existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://comp-diffuser.github.io/</p></details> |

| **[Riemannian Direct Trajectory Optimization of Rigid Bodies on Matrix Lie Groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02323v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing dynamically feasible trajectories for rigid bodies is a fundamental problem in robotics. Although direct trajectory optimization is widely applied to solve this problem, inappropriate parameterizations of rigid body dynamics often result in slow convergence and violations of the intrinsic topological structure of the rotation group. This paper introduces a Riemannian optimization framework for direct trajectory optimization of rigid bodies. We first use the Lie Group Variational Integrator to formulate the discrete rigid body dynamics on matrix Lie groups. We then derive the closed-form first- and second-order Riemannian derivatives of the dynamics. Finally, this work applies a line-search Riemannian Interior Point Method (RIPM) to perform trajectory optimization with general nonlinear constraints. As the optimization is performed on matrix Lie groups, it is correct-by-construction to respect the topological structure of the rotation group and be free of singularities. The paper demonstrates that both the derivative evaluations and Newton steps required to solve the RIPM exhibit linear complexity with respect to the planning horizon and system degrees of freedom. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed method is faster than conventional methods by an order of magnitude in challenging robotics tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16310v4)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.5\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

Traditional modular methods suffer from error propagation, while existing end-to-end models typically employ static one-shot inference paradigms that inadequately capture the dynamic changes of the environment. ARTEMIS takes a different method by generating trajectory waypoints sequentially, preserves critical temporal dependencies while dynamically routing scene-specific queries to specialized expert networks. It effectively relieves trajectory quality degradation issues encountered when guidance information is ambiguous, and overcomes the inherent representational limitations of singular network architectures when processing diverse driving scenarios. Additionally, we use a lightweight batch reallocation strategy that significantly improves the training speed of the Mixture-of-Experts model. Through experiments on the NAVSIM dataset, ARTEMIS exhibits superior competitive performance, achieving 87.0 PDMS and 83.1 EPDMS with ResNet-34 backbone, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error at convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work.

The network has primarily focused on Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Broadcast (ADS-B) data, which provides high-frequency position updates over terrestrial areas. However, the ADS-B signals are limited over oceans and remote regions, where ground-based receivers are scarce. To address these coverage gaps, the OpenSky Network has begun incorporating data from the Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Contract (ADS-C) system, which uses satellite communication to track aircraft positions over oceanic regions and remote areas. In this paper, we analyze a dataset of over 720,000 ADS-C messages collected in 2024 from around 2,600 unique aircraft via the Alphasat satellite, covering Europe, Africa, and parts of the Atlantic Ocean. We present our approach to combining ADS-B and ADS-C data to construct detailed long-haul flight paths, particularly for transatlantic and African routes. Our findings demonstrate that this integration significantly improves trajectory reconstruction accuracy, allowing for better fuel consumption and emissions estimates. We illustrate how combined data captures flight patterns across previously underrepresented regions across Africa. Despite coverage limitations, this work marks an important advancement in providing open access to global flight trajectory data, enabling new research opportunities in air traffic management, environmental impact assessment, and aviation safety.</p></details> |  |

This study addresses the challenges of video-based vessel tracking and prediction by integrating advanced object detection methods, Kalman filters, and spline-based interpolation. However, existing detection systems often misclassify objects in inland waterways due to complex surroundings. A comparative evaluation of tracking algorithms, including BoT-SORT, Deep OC-SORT, and ByeTrack, highlights the robustness of the Kalman filter in providing smoothed trajectories. Experimental results from diverse scenarios demonstrate improved accuracy in predicting vessel movements, which is essential for collision avoidance and situational awareness. The findings underline the necessity of customized datasets and models for inland navigation. Future work will expand the datasets and incorporate vessel classification to refine predictions, supporting both autonomous systems and human operators in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

Despite its significance, research in this domain remains relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories, incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories. We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming existing methods by a considerable margin.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art motion forecasting models rely on large curated datasets with manually annotated or heavily post-processed trajectories. However, building these datasets is costly, generally manual, hard to scale, and lacks reproducibility. They also introduce domain gaps that limit generalization across environments. We introduce PPT (Pretraining with Pseudo-labeled Trajectories), a simple and scalable alternative that uses unprocessed and diverse trajectories automatically generated from off-the-shelf 3D detectors and tracking. Unlike traditional pipelines aiming for clean, single-label annotations, PPT embraces noise and diversity as useful signals for learning robust representations. With optional finetuning on a small amount of labeled data, models pretrained with PPT achieve strong performance across standard benchmarks particularly in low-data regimes, and in cross-domain, end-to-end and multi-class settings. PPT is easy to implement and improves generalization in motion forecasting.

Over the past two decades, researchers have extended these methods to analyze trajectories of humans, animals, and vehicles, studying their behavior and movement across applications. This paper presents whole-trajectory clustering and sub-trajectory clustering algorithms based on DBSCAN line segment clustering, which encompasses two key events: split and merge of line segments. The events are employed by object movement history and the average Euclidean distance between line segments. In this framework, whole-trajectory clustering considers entire entities' trajectories, whereas sub-trajectory clustering employs a sliding window model to identify similar sub-trajectories. Many existing trajectory clustering algorithms respond to temporary anomalies in data by splitting trajectories, which often obscures otherwise consistent clustering patterns and leads to less reliable insights. We introduce the stable trajectory clustering algorithm, which leverages the mean absolute deviation concept to demonstrate that selective omission of transient deviations not only preserves the integrity of clusters but also improves their stability and interpretability. We run all proposed algorithms on real trajectory datasets to illustrate their effectiveness and sensitivity to parameter variations.</p></details> |  |

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, maintaining tracking continuity and consistency remains a significant challenge. Traditional detection-assignment tracking methods struggle with false positives, false negatives, and frequent identity switches, leading to degraded counting accuracy and making in-depth analysis impossible. This paper introduces a point-oriented online tracking algorithm that improves trajectory continuity and counting reliability in drone-based crowd monitoring. Our method builds on the Simple Online and Real-time Tracking (SORT) framework, replacing the original bounding-box assignment with a point-distance metric. The algorithm is enhanced with three cost-effective techniques: camera motion compensation, altitude-aware assignment, and classification-based trajectory validation. Further, Deep Discriminative Correlation Filters (DDCF) that re-use spatial feature maps from localisation algorithms for increased computational efficiency through neural network resource sharing are integrated to refine object tracking by reducing noise and handling missed detections. The proposed method is evaluated on the DroneCrowd and newly shared UP-COUNT-TRACK datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in tracking metrics, reducing counting errors to 23% and 15%, respectively. The results also indicate a significant reduction of identity switches while maintaining high tracking accuracy, outperforming baseline online trackers and even an offline greedy optimisation method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to the Expert Systems with Applications journal</p></details> |
| **[Kinodynamic Trajectory Following with STELA: Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation & Local Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20009v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation and control are often addressed separately, leading to unsafe execution due to sensing noise, execution errors, and discrepancies between the planning model and reality. Simultaneous control and trajectory estimation using probabilistic graphical models has been proposed as a unified solution to these challenges. Previous work, however, relies heavily on appropriate Gaussian priors and is limited to holonomic robots with linear time-varying models. The current research extends graphical optimization methods to vehicles with arbitrary dynamical models via Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation and Local Adaptation (STELA). The overall approach initializes feasible trajectories using a kinodynamic, sampling-based motion planner. Then, it simultaneously: (i) estimates the past trajectory based on noisy observations, and (ii) adapts the controls to be executed to minimize deviations from the planned, feasible trajectory, while avoiding collisions. The proposed factor graph representation of trajectories in STELA can be applied for any dynamical system given access to first or second-order state update equations, and introduces the duration of execution between two states in the trajectory discretization as an optimization variable. These features provide both generalization and flexibility in trajectory following. In addition to targeting computational efficiency, the proposed strategy performs incremental updates of the factor graph using the iSAM algorithm and introduces a time-window mechanism. This mechanism allows the factor graph to be dynamically updated to operate over a limited history and forward horizon of the planned trajectory. This enables online updates of controls at a minimum of 10Hz. Experiments demonstrate that STELA achieves at least comparable performance to previous frameworks on idealized vehicles with linear dynamics.[...]</p></details> | [Accepted] RSS 2025 |

While, the spin is not directly observable in standard broadcasting videos, we show that it can be inferred from the ball's trajectory in the video. We present a novel method to infer the initial spin and 3D trajectory from the corresponding 2D trajectory in a video. Without ground truth labels for broadcast videos, we train a neural network solely on synthetic data. Due to the choice of our input data representation, physically correct synthetic training data, and using targeted augmentations, the network naturally generalizes to real data. Notably, these simple techniques are sufficient to achieve generalization. No real data at all is required for training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a method for spin and trajectory prediction in simple monocular broadcast videos, achieving an accuracy of 92.0% in spin classification and a 2D reprojection error of 0.19% of the image diagonal.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)</p></details> |

However, existing methods face robotic hardware dependency and control frequency mismatches between teleoperation devices and robotic platforms. Our approach automatically extracts kinematic parameters from unified robot description format (URDF) files, and enables pluggable deployment across diverse robots through uniform interfaces. The proposed interpolation algorithm bridges the frequency gap between low-rate human inputs and high-frequency robotic control commands through online continuous trajectory generation, \n{while requiring no access to the closed, bottom-level control loop}. To enhance trajectory smoothness, we introduce a minimum-stretch spline that optimizes the motion quality.

Existing deep generative models learn from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with increasing data size. More importantly, they often lack control mechanisms to guide the generated trajectories under constraints such as enforcing specific visits. To address these limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem for effectively handling multiple spatiotemporal constraints. We introduce Geo-Llama, a novel LLM finetuning framework that can enforce multiple explicit visit constraints while maintaining contextual coherence of the generated trajectories. In this approach, pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned on trajectory data with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a specific time and location. This strategy enables the model to capture spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders while maintaining flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning with Model Predictive Control for Obstacle Avoidance Considering Prediction Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19193v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel trajectory planner for autonomous robots, specifically designed to enhance navigation by incorporating dynamic obstacle avoidance within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) and Navigation 2 (Nav2) framework. The proposed method utilizes Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a focus on handling the uncertainties associated with the movement prediction of dynamic obstacles. Unlike existing Nav2 trajectory planners which primarily deal with static obstacles or react to the current position of dynamic obstacles, this planner predicts future obstacle positions using a stochastic Vector Auto-Regressive Model (VAR). The obstacles' future positions are represented by probability distributions, and collision avoidance is achieved through constraints based on the Mahalanobis distance, ensuring the robot avoids regions where obstacles are likely to be. This approach considers the robot's kinodynamic constraints, enabling it to track a reference path while adapting to real-time changes in the environment. The paper details the implementation, including obstacle prediction, tracking, and the construction of feasible sets for MPC. Simulation results in a Gazebo environment demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in scenarios where robots must navigate around each other, showing improved collision avoidance capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to IFAC for publication under a Creative Commons Licence CC-BY-NC-ND</p></details> |

Therefore, fin-driven autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can achieve high maneuverability with a smaller number of actuators, but their control is challenging. This study proposes an analytic control allocation method for underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). By integrating an adaptive hybrid feedback controller, we enable an AUV with 4 actuators to move in 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) in simulation and up to 5-DOF in real-world experiments. The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art control allocation techniques in 6-DOF trajectory tracking simulations, exhibiting centimeter-scale accuracy and higher energy and computational efficiency. Real-world pool experiments confirmed the method's robustness and efficacy in tracking complex 3D trajectories, with significant computational efficiency gains 0.007 (ms) vs. 22.28 (ms). Our method offers a balance between performance, energy efficiency, and computational efficiency, showcasing a potential avenue for more effective tracking of a large number of DOF for under-actuated underwater robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Stochastic Thermodynamics Directly from Correlation and Trajectory-Fluctuation Currents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19007v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markedly increased computational power and data acquisition have led to growing interest in data-driven inverse dynamics problems. These seek to answer a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in stochastic thermodynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 appendices (10 pages), 4 figures; https://csc.ucdavis.edu/~cmg/compmech/pubs/currents.htm</p></details> |
| **[DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Longitudinal Trajectory Dataset for Automated Vehicle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00009v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Vehicles (AVs) promise significant advances in transportation. Critical to these improvements is understanding AVs' longitudinal behavior, relying heavily on real-world trajectory data. Existing open-source trajectory datasets of AV, however, often fall short in refinement, reliability, and completeness, hindering effective performance metrics analysis and model development. This study addresses these challenges by creating a Unified Longitudinal TRAjectory dataset for AVs (Ultra-AV) to analyze their microscopic longitudinal driving behaviors. This dataset compiles data from 13 distinct sources, encompassing various AV types, test sites, and experiment scenarios. We established a three-step data processing: 1. extraction of longitudinal trajectory data, 2. general data cleaning, and 3. data-specific cleaning to obtain the longitudinal trajectory data and car-following trajectory data. The validity of the processed data is affirmed through performance evaluations across safety, mobility, stability, and sustainability, along with an analysis of the relationships between variables in car-following models. Our work not only furnishes researchers with standardized data and metrics for longitudinal AV behavior studies but also sets guidelines for data collection and model development.</p></details> | NA |

While these methods achieve exceptional performance in defined datasets, they usually rely on the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption and thus tend to be vulnerable to distribution shifts that occur in the real world. In addition, these methods lack explainability due to their black box nature, which poses further challenges in terms of the approval process and social trustworthiness. Therefore, in order to use the capabilities of data-driven statistical AI methods in a reliable and trustworthy manner, the concept of TrustMHE is introduced and investigated in this paper. TrustMHE represents a complementary approach, independent of the underlying AI systems, that combines AI-driven out-of-distribution detection with control-driven moving horizon estimation (MHE) to enable not only detection and monitoring, but also intervention. The effectiveness of the proposed TrustMHE is evaluated and proven in three simulation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), JCluj-Napoca, Romania, June 22-25, 2025</p></details> |

While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Reupl...</summary><p>Reuploaded with new version-- equation 16 was incorrect</p></details> |

However, they have seen limited application in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. This is due to the difficulty in reasoning about collisions in radiance models and the computational complexity associated with operating in dense models. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer operating in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method to rigorously upper-bound the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Then, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables efficient computation of this collision bound. Finally, this paper presents a method to optimize trajectories that avoid collisions in a Gaussian Splat. Experiments show that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in cluttered environments. The proposed system is also tested on a real-world robot manipulator.

While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixed Bernstein-Fourier Approximants for Optimal Trajectory Generation with Periodic Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17969v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient trajectory generation is critical for autonomous systems, yet current numerical methods often struggle to handle periodic behaviors effectively, especially when equidistant time nodes are required. This paper introduces a novel mixed Bernstein-Fourier approximation framework tailored explicitly for optimal motion planning. Our proposed methodology leverages the uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials for nonperiodic behaviors while effectively capturing periodic dynamics through Fourier series. Theoretical results are established, including uniform convergence proofs for approximations of functions, derivatives, and integrals, as well as detailed error bound analyses. We further introduce a regulated least squares approach for determining approximation coefficients, enhancing numerical stability and practical applicability. Within an optimal control context, we establish feasibility and consistency of approximated solutions to their continuous counterparts. We also extend the covector mapping theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for approximating dual variables crucial in verifying the necessary optimality conditions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Comprehensive numerical examples illustrate the method's superior performance, demonstrating substantial improvements in computational efficiency and precision in scenarios with complex periodic constraints and dynamics. Our mixed Bernstein-Fourier methodology thus presents a robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient approach for advanced optimal trajectory planning in autonomous systems.</p></details> | 49 pages, 9 figures |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions. Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories. We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 30 figures, Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

There is a urgent need to minimize the data size in LLM training. Compared with data selection method, the data distillation method aims to synthesize a small number of data samples to achieve the training effect of the full data set and has better flexibility. Despite its successes in computer vision, the discreteness of text data has hitherto stymied its exploration in natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we proposed a method that involves learning pseudo prompt data based on trajectory matching and finding its nearest neighbor ID to achieve cross-architecture transfer. During the distillation process, we introduce a regularization loss to improve the robustness of our distilled data. To our best knowledge, this is the first data distillation work suitable for text generation tasks such as instruction tuning. Evaluations on two benchmarks, including ARC-Easy and MMLU instruction tuning datasets, established the superiority of our distillation approach over the SOTA data selection method LESS. Furthermore, our method demonstrates a good transferability over LLM structures (i.e., OPT to Llama).</p></details> |  |

Our framework begins by generating panoptic occupancy local semantic maps and accurate localization information from data aligned between a monocular camera, IMU, and GPS. This information is combined with input terrain point clouds or preloaded terrain information to initialize the planning process. We propose the Radiant Field-Informed Coverage Planning algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion field model to dynamically adjust the robot's coverage trajectory and speed based on environmental attributes such as dirtiness and dryness. By modeling the spatial influence of the robot's actions using a Gaussian field, ensures a speed-optimized, uniform coverage trajectory while adapting to varying environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building Real-time Awareness of Out-of-distribution in Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17277v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is essential for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles in real-world environments. Even well-trained machine learning models may produce unreliable predictions due to discrepancies between training data and real-world conditions encountered during inference. In particular, the training dataset tends to overrepresent common scenes (e.g., straight lanes) while underrepresenting less frequent ones (e.g., traffic circles). In addition, it often overlooks unpredictable real-world events such as sudden braking or falling objects. To ensure safety, it is critical to detect in real-time when a model's predictions become unreliable. Leveraging the intuition that in-distribution (ID) scenes exhibit error patterns similar to training data, while out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes do not, we introduce a principled, real-time approach for OOD detection by framing it as a change-point detection problem. We address the challenging settings where the OOD scenes are deceptive, meaning that they are not easily detectable by human intuitions. Our lightweight solutions can handle the occurrence of OOD at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraCeS: Trajectory Based Credit Assignment From Sparse Safety Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12557v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In safe reinforcement learning (RL), auxiliary safety costs are used to align the agent to safe decision making. In practice, safety constraints, including cost functions and budgets, are unknown or hard to specify, as it requires anticipation of all possible unsafe behaviors. We therefore address a general setting where the true safety definition is unknown, and has to be learned from sparsely labeled data. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety model that performs credit assignment to estimate each decision step's impact on the overall safety using a dataset of diverse trajectories and their corresponding binary safety labels (i.e., whether the corresponding trajectory is safe/unsafe). Second, we illustrate the architecture of our safety model to demonstrate its ability to learn a separate safety score for each timestep. Third, we reformulate the safe RL problem using the proposed safety model and derive an effective algorithm to optimize a safe yet rewarding policy. Finally, our empirical results corroborate our findings and show that this approach is effective in satisfying unknown safety definition, and scalable to various continuous control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SILM: A Subjective Intent Based Low-Latency Framework for Multiple Traffic Participants Joint Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16377v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a fundamental technology for advanced autonomous driving systems and represents one of the most challenging problems in the field of cognitive intelligence. Accurately predicting the future trajectories of each traffic participant is a prerequisite for building high safety and high reliability decision-making, planning, and control capabilities in autonomous driving. However, existing methods often focus solely on the motion of other traffic participants without considering the underlying intent behind that motion, which increases the uncertainty in trajectory prediction. Autonomous vehicles operate in real-time environments, meaning that trajectory prediction algorithms must be able to process data and generate predictions in real-time. While many existing methods achieve high accuracy, they often struggle to effectively handle heterogeneous traffic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Subjective Intent-based Low-latency framework for Multiple traffic participants joint trajectory prediction. Our method explicitly incorporates the subjective intent of traffic participants based on their key points, and predicts the future trajectories jointly without map, which ensures promising performance while significantly reducing the prediction latency. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset designed specifically for trajectory prediction. Related code and dataset will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

As this is a novel task, there is currently no relevant dataset available in the community. To address this gap, we first devised a new visualization language called Trajectory Visualization Language (TVL) to facilitate querying trajectory data and generating visualizations. Building on this foundation, we further proposed a dataset construction method that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with human efforts to create high-quality data. Specifically, we first generate TVLs using a comprehensive and systematic process, and then label each TVL with corresponding natural language questions using LLMs. This process results in the creation of the first large-scale Text-to-TrajVis dataset, named TrajVL, which contains 18,140 (question, TVL) pairs. Based on this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of multiple LLMs (GPT, Qwen, Llama, etc.) on this task. The experimental results demonstrate that this task is both feasible and highly challenging and merits further exploration within the research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[DriVerse: Navigation World Model for Driving Simulation via Multimodal Trajectory Prompting and Motion Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18576v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents DriVerse, a generative model for simulating navigation-driven driving scenes from a single image and a future trajectory. Previous autonomous driving world models either directly feed the trajectory or discrete control signals into the generation pipeline, leading to poor alignment between the control inputs and the implicit features of the 2D base generative model, which results in low-fidelity video outputs. Some methods use coarse textual commands or discrete vehicle control signals, which lack the precision to guide fine-grained, trajectory-specific video generation, making them unsuitable for evaluating actual autonomous driving algorithms. DriVerse introduces explicit trajectory guidance in two complementary forms: it tokenizes trajectories into textual prompts using a predefined trend vocabulary for seamless language integration, and converts 3D trajectories into 2D spatial motion priors to enhance control over static content within the driving scene. To better handle dynamic objects, we further introduce a lightweight motion alignment module, which focuses on the inter-frame consistency of dynamic pixels, significantly enhancing the temporal coherence of moving elements over long sequences. With minimal training and no need for additional data, DriVerse outperforms specialized models on future video generation tasks across both the nuScenes and Waymo datasets. The code and models will be released to the public.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Dynamic Intent Queries for Motion Transformer-based Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15766v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, accurately predicting the movements of other traffic participants is crucial, as it significantly influences a vehicle's planning processes. Modern trajectory prediction models strive to interpret complex patterns and dependencies from agent and map data. The Motion Transformer (MTR) architecture and subsequent work define the most accurate methods in common benchmarks such as the Waymo Open Motion Benchmark. The MTR model employs pre-generated static intention points as initial goal points for trajectory prediction. However, the static nature of these points frequently leads to misalignment with map data in specific traffic scenarios, resulting in unfeasible or unrealistic goal points. Our research addresses this limitation by integrating scene-specific dynamic intention points into the MTR model. This adaptation of the MTR model was trained and evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating dynamic intention points has a significant positive impact on trajectory prediction accuracy, especially for predictions over long time horizons. Furthermore, we analyze the impact on ground truth trajectories which are not compliant with the map data or are illegal maneuvers.</p></details> |  |

Agents and their social interactions have been quantified and modeled by researchers from various perspectives; however, substantial limitations exist in the current work due to the inherent high uncertainty of agent intentions and the complex higher-order influences among neighboring groups. SocialMOIF is proposed to tackle these challenges, concentrating on the higher-order intention interactions among neighboring groups while reinforcing the primary role of first-order intention interactions between neighbors and the target agent. This method develops a multi-order intention fusion model to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of both direct and indirect intention information. Within SocialMOIF, a trajectory distribution approximator is designed to guide the trajectories toward values that align more closely with the actual data, thereby enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, a global trajectory optimizer is introduced to enable more accurate and efficient parallel predictions. By incorporating a novel loss function that accounts for distance and direction during training, experimental results demonstrate that the model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics in both dynamic and static datasets.</p></details> | 11 pages,6 figures |

Quantum-Train (QT), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages quantum neural networks (QNNs) to generate trainable parameters exclusively during training, eliminating the need for quantum hardware at inference time. Building on QT's success across multiple domains, including image classification, reinforcement learning, flood prediction, and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, we introduce Quantum Parameter Adaptation (QPA) for efficient typhoon forecasting model learning. Integrated with an Attention-based Multi-ConvGRU model, QPA enables parameter-efficient training while maintaining predictive accuracy. This work represents the first application of quantum machine learning (QML) to large-scale typhoon trajectory prediction, offering a scalable and energy-efficient approach to climate modeling. Our results demonstrate that QPA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving performance, making high-performance forecasting more accessible and sustainable through hybrid quantum-classical learning.</p></details> |  |

While modern Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can handle diverse robotic tasks, they often incur high per-step inference costs, resulting in significant latency, sometimes minutes per task. In contrast, RT-cache stores a large-scale Memory of previously successful robot trajectories and retrieves relevant multistep motion snippets, drastically reducing inference overhead. By integrating a Memory Builder with a Trajectory Retrieval, we develop an efficient retrieval process that remains tractable even for extremely large datasets. RT-cache flexibly accumulates real-world experiences and replays them whenever the current scene matches past states, adapting quickly to new or unseen environments with only a few additional samples. Experiments on the Open-X Embodiment Dataset and other real-world data demonstrate that RT-cache completes tasks both faster and more successfully than a baseline lacking retrieval, suggesting a practical, data-driven solution for real-time manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures.

| **[DiffOG: Differentiable Policy Trajectory Optimization with Generalizability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13807v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning-based visuomotor policies excel at manipulation tasks but often produce suboptimal action trajectories compared to model-based methods. Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. DiffOG refines action trajectories to be smoother and more constraint-compliant while maintaining alignment with the original demonstration distribution, thus avoiding degradation in policy performance. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy.

The key idea is to capture each task by an object-centric representation, specifically the SE(3) object pose trajectory relative to the target. This approach decouples embodiment actions from sensory inputs, facilitating learning from various demonstration types, including both action-based and action-less human hand demonstrations, as well as cross-embodiment generalization. Additionally, object pose trajectories inherently capture planning constraints from demonstrations without the need for manually-crafted rules. To guide the robot in executing the task, the object trajectory is used to condition a diffusion policy. We systematically evaluate our method on simulation and real-world tasks. In real-world evaluation, using only eight demonstrations shot on an iPhone, our approach completed all tasks while fully complying with task constraints.

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

However, existing methods often struggle to accurately capture this intricate structure from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data, particularly due to the lack of ground truth labels and the ambiguous, intertwined nature of fiber trajectories. We present a novel deep learning framework for unsupervised clustering of myocardial fibers, providing a data-driven approach to identifying distinct fiber bundles. We uniquely combine a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to capture local sequential information along fibers, with a Transformer autoencoder to learn global shape features, with pointwise incorporation of essential anatomical context. Clustering these representations using a density-based algorithm identifies 33 to 62 robust clusters, successfully capturing the subtle distinctions in fiber trajectories with varying levels of granularity. Our framework offers a new, flexible, and quantitative way to analyze myocardial structure, achieving a level of delineation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously achieved, with potential applications in improving surgical planning, characterizing disease-related remodeling, and ultimately, advancing personalized cardiac care.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Optimal Trajectory Planning with Collision Avoidance for Autonomous Vehicle Maneuvering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08724v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To perform autonomous driving maneuvers, such as parallel or perpendicular parking, a vehicle requires continual speed and steering adjustments to follow a generated path. In consequence, the path's quality is a limiting factor of the vehicle maneuver's performance. While most path planning approaches include finding a collision-free route, optimal trajectory planning involves solving the best transition from initial to final states, minimizing the action over all paths permitted by a kinematic model. Here we propose a novel method based on sequential convex optimization, which permits flexible and efficient optimal trajectory generation. The objective is to achieve the fastest time, shortest distance, and fewest number of path segments to satisfy motion requirements, while avoiding sensor blind-spots. In our approach, vehicle kinematics are represented by a discretized Dubins model. To avoid collisions, each waypoint is constrained by linear inequalities representing closest distance of obstacles to a polygon specifying the vehicle's extent. To promote smooth and valid trajectories, the solved kinematic state and control variables are constrained and regularized by penalty terms in the model's cost function, which enforces physical restrictions including limits for steering angle, acceleration and speed. In this paper, we analyze trajectories obtained for several parking scenarios. Results demonstrate efficient and collision-free motion generated by the proposed technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIAM ...</summary><p>SIAM Conference on Control and Its Applications, July 28-30th, 2025, Montreal, Canada</p></details> |

This paper presents a distributed trajectory planning algorithm for a quadrotor swarm that operates asynchronously and requires no communication except during the initial planning phase. Moreover, our algorithm guarantees no deadlock under asynchronous updates and absence of communication during flight. To effectively ensure these points, we build two main modules: coordination state updater and trajectory optimizer. The coordination state updater computes waypoints for each agent toward its goal and performs subgoal optimization while considering deadlocks, as well as safety constraints with respect to neighbor agents and obstacles. Then, the trajectory optimizer generates a trajectory that ensures collision avoidance even with the asynchronous planning updates of neighboring agents. We provide a theoretical guarantee of collision avoidance with deadlock resolution and evaluate the effectiveness of our method in complex simulation environments, including random forests and narrow-gap mazes. Additionally, to reduce the total mission time, we design a faster coordination state update using lightweight communication. Lastly, our approach is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments with cluttered environment scenarios.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

However, a key challenge in such approaches lies in selecting an appropriate masking strategy. Previous studies have explored predefined masking techniques, including random and tube-based masking, as well as approaches that leverage key motion priors, optical flow and semantic cues from externally pre-trained models. In this work, we introduce a novel and generalizable Trajectory-Aware Adaptive Token Sampler (TATS), which models the motion dynamics of tokens and can be seamlessly integrated into the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework to select motion-centric tokens in videos. Additionally, we propose a unified training strategy that enables joint optimization of both MAE and TATS from scratch using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We show that our model allows for aggressive masking without compromising performance on the downstream task of action recognition while also ensuring that the pre-training remains memory efficient. Extensive experiments of the proposed approach across four benchmarks, including Something-Something v2, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, generalization, and efficiency of our work compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the spatial information encoded in 3DGS, this work proposes FOCI (Field Overlap Collision Integral), an algorithm that is able to optimize trajectories directly on the Gaussians themselves. FOCI leverages a novel and interpretable collision formulation for 3DGS using the notion of the overlap integral between Gaussians. Contrary to other approaches, which represent the robot with conservative bounding boxes that underestimate the traversability of the environment, we propose to represent the environment and the robot as Gaussian Splats. This not only has desirable computational properties, but also allows for orientation-aware planning, allowing the robot to pass through very tight and narrow spaces. We extensively test our algorithm in both synthetic and real Gaussian Splats, showcasing that collision-free trajectories for the ANYmal legged robot that can be computed in a few seconds, even with hundreds of thousands of Gaussians making up the environment.

| **[UVTM: Universal Vehicle Trajectory Modeling with ST Feature Domain Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07232v4)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle movement is frequently captured in the form of GPS trajectories, i.e., sequences of timestamped GPS locations. Such data is widely used for various tasks such as travel-time estimation, trajectory recovery, and trajectory prediction. A universal vehicle trajectory model could be applied to different tasks, removing the need to maintain multiple specialized models, thereby reducing computational and storage costs. However, creating such a model is challenging when the integrity of trajectory features is compromised, i.e., in scenarios where only partial features are available or the trajectories are sparse. To address these challenges, we propose the Universal Vehicle Trajectory Model (UVTM), which can effectively adapt to different tasks without excessive retraining. UVTM incorporates two specialized designs. First, it divides trajectory features into three distinct domains. Each domain can be masked and generated independently to accommodate tasks with only partially available features. Second, UVTM is pre-trained by reconstructing dense, feature-complete trajectories from sparse, feature-incomplete counterparts, enabling strong performance even when the integrity of trajectory features is compromised. Experiments involving four representative trajectory-related tasks on three real-world vehicle trajectory datasets provide insight into the performance of UVTM and offer evidence that it is capable of meeting its objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACT-R: Adaptive Camera Trajectories for 3D Reconstruction from Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08239v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce adaptive view planning to multi-view synthesis, aiming to improve both occlusion revelation and 3D consistency for single-view 3D reconstruction. Instead of generating an unordered set of views independently or simultaneously, we generate a sequence of views, leveraging temporal consistency to enhance 3D coherence. Most importantly, our view sequence is not determined by a pre-determined camera setup. Instead, we compute an adaptive camera trajectory (ACT), specifically, an orbit of camera views, which maximizes the visibility of occluded regions of the 3D object to be reconstructed. Once the best orbit is found, we feed it to a video diffusion model to generate novel views around the orbit, which in turn, are passed to a multi-view 3D reconstruction model to obtain the final reconstruction. Our multi-view synthesis pipeline is quite efficient since it involves no run-time training/optimization, only forward inferences by applying the pre-trained models for occlusion analysis and multi-view synthesis. Our method predicts camera trajectories that reveal occlusions effectively and produce consistent novel views, significantly improving 3D reconstruction over SOTA on the unseen GSO dataset, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes a novel graph-based approach for floor separation using Wi-Fi fingerprint trajectories, addressing the challenge of vertical localization in indoor settings. We construct a graph where nodes represent Wi-Fi fingerprints, and edges are weighted by signal similarity and contextual transitions. Node2Vec is employed to generate low-dimensional embeddings, which are subsequently clustered using K-means to identify distinct floors. Evaluated on the Huawei University Challenge 2021 dataset, our method outperforms traditional community detection algorithms, achieving an accuracy of 68.97%, an F1- score of 61.99%, and an Adjusted Rand Index of 57.19%. By publicly releasing the preprocessed dataset and implementation code, this work contributes to advancing research in indoor positioning. The proposed approach demonstrates robustness to signal noise and architectural complexities, offering a scalable solution for floor-level localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Trajectory Stitching with Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07802v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have shown great promise as trajectory planners, given their affinity to modeling complex distributions and guidable inference process. Previous works have successfully applied these in the context of robotic manipulation but perform poorly when the required solution does not exist as a complete trajectory within the training set. We identify that this is a result of being unable to plan via stitching, and subsequently address the architectural and dataset choices needed to remedy this. On top of this, we propose a novel addition to the training and inference procedures to both stabilize and enhance these capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating plans with out of distribution boundary conditions and performing obstacle avoidance on the Franka Panda in simulation and on real hardware. In both of these tasks our method performs significantly better than the baselines and is able to avoid obstacles up to four times as large.</p></details> |  |

However, comprehensive datasets that capture real-world career trajectories are scarce. In this paper, we introduce JobHop, a large-scale public dataset derived from anonymized resumes provided by VDAB, the public employment service in Flanders, Belgium. Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), we process unstructured resume data to extract structured career information, which is then mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes using a multi-label classification model. This results in a rich dataset of over 2.3 million work experiences, extracted from and grouped into more than 391,000 user resumes and mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes, offering valuable insights into real-world occupational transitions. This dataset enables diverse applications, such as analyzing labor market mobility, job stability, and the effects of career breaks on occupational transitions. It also supports career path prediction and other data-driven decision-making processes. To illustrate its potential, we explore key dataset characteristics, including job distributions, career breaks, and job transitions, demonstrating its value for advancing labor market research.</p></details> |  |
| **[SICNav-Diffusion: Safe and Interactive Crowd Navigation with Diffusion Trajectory Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08858v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To navigate crowds without collisions, robots must interact with humans by forecasting their future motion and reacting accordingly. While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite-Alphabet-Aware Trajectory and Precoder Optimization for UAV Relaying](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08680v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become key enablers in relay-assisted wireless communications thanks to their flexibility and line-of-sight channel advantage. However, most existing trajectory optimization frameworks assume ideal Gaussian inputs, overlooking the fact that practical wireless systems rely on structured, finite-alphabet constellations. This mismatch can lead to suboptimal, and sometimes misleading, design choices. In this paper, we challenge that convention by introducing a finite-alphabet-aware framework for joint trajectory and precoder optimization in UAV-assisted relay systems. We formulate a non-convex design problem that directly accounts for discrete signal structures and propose an efficient solution based on alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Simulation results reveal that strategies optimized under Gaussian assumptions can waste energy and degrade throughput in real deployments. In contrast, our approach adapts both the UAV's trajectory and transmission strategy to the underlying modulation format, delivering consistent performance gains under practical system constraints. This work takes a key step toward aligning UAV communication design with the realities of modern wireless systems: discrete signals, power limits, and intelligent mobility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jointly spatial-temporal representation learning for individual trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04055v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual trajectories, rich in human-environment interaction information across space and time, serve as vital inputs for geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs). However, existing attempts at learning trajectory representations have overlooked the implicit spatial-temporal dependency within trajectories, failing to encode such dependency in a deep learning-friendly format. That poses a challenge in obtaining general-purpose trajectory representations. Therefore, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal joint representation learning method (ST-GraphRL) to formalize learnable spatial-temporal dependencies into trajectory representations. The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a weighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility interactions in both space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage jointly encoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion), to learn entangled spatial-temporal dependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating space and time information; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn explicit mobility regularities by simulating the spatial-temporal distributions of trajectories. Tested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed ST-GraphRL outperformed all the baseline models in predicting movement spatial-temporal distributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal correlations. Analyzing spatial-temporal features presented in latent space validates that ST-GraphRL understands spatial-temporal patterns. This study may also benefit representation learnings of other geospatial data to achieve general-purpose data representations and advance GeoFMs development.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 3 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

The challenge is to compute near-optimal sensor placements for detecting targets whose trajectories follow a log-Gaussian Cox line process. We explore sensor deployment in a transformed space, where linear target trajectories are represented as points. While this space simplifies handling the line process, the spatial functions representing sensor performance (i.e. probability of detection) become less intuitive. To illustrate our approach, we focus on positioning sensors of the barrier coverage system on the seafloor to detect passing ships. Through numerical experiments using historical ship data, we compute sensor locations that maximize the probability all ship passing over the barrier coverage system are detected.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in IEEE SysCon 2025</p></details> |

This paper investigates the 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory and communication optimization for low-altitude air-ground cooperation systems, where mobile unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) upload data to UAVs. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to maximize the minimal sum-rate of UGVs while ensuring quality of service and navigation constraints. The proposed algorithm integrates a successive convex approximation (SCA)-penalty method for UGV-UAV scheduling, an SCA-based approach for UGV transmit power control, and a novel warm-start particle swarm optimization with cross mutation (WS-PSO-CM). The WS-PSO-CM leverages convex optimization results from a statistical channel model to initialize particle swarm, significantly improving the performance, compared with celebrated PSO-CM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a $45.8$\% higher minimal sum-rate compared to the baseline PSO-CM under the same iterations. This gain can be translated to reducing computational time by $46.7$\% of PSO-CM. Furthermore, our simulation results reveal that UAVs dynamically adjust trajectories to avoid interference by buildings, and maintain proximity to UGVs to mitigate path-loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 6 figures; submit to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Traditional data-driven models predominantly rely on statistical correlations, often overlooking the causal relationships that govern traffic behavior. In this paper, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction framework that leverages causal inference to enhance predictive robustness, generalization, and accuracy. By decomposing the environment into spatial and temporal components, our approach identifies and mitigates spurious correlations, uncovering genuine causal relationships. We also employ a progressive fusion strategy to integrate multimodal information, simulating human-like reasoning processes and enabling real-time inference. Evaluations on five real-world datasets--ApolloScape, nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD--demonstrate our model's superiority over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with improvements in key metrics such as RMSE and FDE. Our findings highlight the potential of causal reasoning to transform trajectory prediction, paving the way for robust AD systems.</p></details> |  |

However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025) for oral presentation</p></details> |
| **[Boundary-Guided Trajectory Prediction for Road Aware and Physically Feasible Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06740v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories. Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate under adversarial attacks from 66\% to just 1\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> |

In this setup, measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. Enveloping ellipsoids are employed to characterize state-dependent uncertainties with unknown distributions. The concept of regularity for set-valued output maps is then introduced, facilitating the formulation of the estimation-aware trajectory generation problem. Specifically, it is demonstrated that for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to the finite horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, estimation-aware trajectories can then be synthesized for a broad class of systems. Trajectory planning routines are also examined in this work, by which the observability measure is optimized for systems with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, representative examples in the context of trajectory planning with vision-based estimation are presented. Moreover, the paper presents estimation-aware planning for an uncooperative Target-Rendezvous problem, where an Ego-satellite employs an onboard machine learning (ML)-based estimation module to realize the rendezvous trajectory.</p></details> | 40 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Barrier-Enhanced Parallel Homotopic Trajectory Optimization for Safety-Critical Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10441v4)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enforcing safety while preventing overly conservative behaviors is essential for autonomous vehicles to achieve high task performance. In this paper, we propose a barrier-enhanced parallel homotopic trajectory optimization (BPHTO) approach with the over-relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for real-time integrated decision-making and planning. To facilitate safety interactions between the ego vehicle (EV) and surrounding vehicles, a spatiotemporal safety module exhibiting bi-convexity is developed on the basis of barrier function. Varying barrier coefficients are adopted for different time steps in a planning horizon to account for the motion uncertainties of surrounding HVs and mitigate conservative behaviors. Additionally, we exploit the discrete characteristics of driving maneuvers to initialize nominal behavior-oriented free-end homotopic trajectories based on reachability analysis, and each trajectory is locally constrained to a specific driving maneuver while sharing the same task objectives. By leveraging the bi-convexity of the safety module and the kinematics of the EV, we formulate the BPHTO as a bi-convex optimization problem. Then constraint transcription and the over-relaxed ADMM are employed to streamline the optimization process, such that multiple trajectories are generated in real time with feasibility guarantees. Through a series of experiments, the proposed development demonstrates improved task accuracy, stability, and consistency in various traffic scenarios using synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Realistic Adversarial Attacks for Robustness Evaluation of Trajectory Prediction Models via Future State Perturbation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06134v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a key element of autonomous vehicle systems, enabling them to anticipate and react to the movements of other road users. Evaluating the robustness of prediction models against adversarial attacks is essential to ensure their reliability in real-world traffic. However, current approaches tend to focus on perturbing the past positions of surrounding agents, which can generate unrealistic scenarios and overlook critical vulnerabilities. This limitation may result in overly optimistic assessments of model performance in real-world conditions. In this work, we demonstrate that perturbing not just past but also future states of adversarial agents can uncover previously undetected weaknesses and thereby provide a more rigorous evaluation of model robustness. Our novel approach incorporates dynamic constraints and preserves tactical behaviors, enabling more effective and realistic adversarial attacks. We introduce new performance measures to assess the realism and impact of these adversarial trajectories. Testing our method on a state-of-the-art prediction model revealed significant increases in prediction errors and collision rates under adversarial conditions. Qualitative analysis further showed that our attacks can expose critical weaknesses, such as the inability of the model to detect potential collisions in what appear to be safe predictions. These results underscore the need for more comprehensive adversarial testing to better evaluate and improve the reliability of trajectory prediction models for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | 20 pages, 3 figures |

The main obstacle is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for city level large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial difficulties for road level small-scale aggregation. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales for static and interactive maps.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present flight results from experiments with the Astrobee free-flying robot on board the International Space Station (ISS), that demonstrate how machine learning can accelerate on-board trajectory optimization while preserving theoretical solver guarantees. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first-ever demonstration of learning-based control on the ISS.

However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, to published in IEEE Sustech 2025</p></details> |
| **[An End-to-End Framework for Optimizing Foot Trajectory and Force in Dry Adhesion Legged Wall-Climbing Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19448v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foot trajectory planning for dry adhesion legged climbing robots presents challenges, as the phases of foot detachment, swing, and adhesion significantly influence the adhesion and detachment forces essential for stable climbing. To tackle this, an end-to-end foot trajectory and force optimization framework (FTFOF) is proposed, which optimizes foot adhesion and detachment forces through trajectory adjustments. This framework accepts general foot trajectory constraints and user-defined parameters as input, ultimately producing an optimal single foot trajectory. It integrates three-segment $C^2$ continuous Bezier curves, tailored to various foot structures, enabling the generation of effective climbing trajectories. A dilate-based GRU predictive model establishes the relationship between foot trajectories and the corresponding foot forces. Multi-objective optimization algorithms, combined with a redundancy hierarchical strategy, identify the most suitable foot trajectory for specific tasks, thereby ensuring optimal performance across detachment force, adhesion force and vibration amplitude. Experimental validation on the quadruped climbing robot MST-M3F showed that, compared to commonly used trajectories in existing legged climbing robots, the proposed framework achieved reductions in maximum detachment force by 28 \%, vibration amplitude by 82 \%, which ensures the stable climbing of dry adhesion legged climbing robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedTDP: A Privacy-Preserving and Unified Framework for Trajectory Data Preparation via Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05155v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data, which capture the movement patterns of people and vehicles over time and space, are crucial for applications like traffic optimization and urban planning. However, issues such as noise and incompleteness often compromise data quality, leading to inaccurate trajectory analyses and limiting the potential of these applications. While Trajectory Data Preparation (TDP) can enhance data quality, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) they do not address data privacy concerns, particularly in federated settings where trajectory data sharing is prohibited, and (ii) they typically design task-specific models that lack generalizability across diverse TDP scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose FedTDP, a privacy-preserving and unified framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for TDP in federated environments. Specifically, we: (i) design a trajectory privacy autoencoder to secure data transmission and protect privacy, (ii) introduce a trajectory knowledge enhancer to improve model learning of TDP-related knowledge, enabling the development of TDP-oriented LLMs, and (iii) propose federated parallel optimization to enhance training efficiency by reducing data transmission and enabling parallel model training. Experiments on 6 real datasets and 10 mainstream TDP tasks demonstrate that FedTDP consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy, while recently proposed deep learning approaches suffer from computational cost, lack of explainability, and generalization issues that limit their practical adoption. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We introduce a Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to promote population diversity and a Statistics Feedback Loop allowing the LLM to analyze alternative predictions. Our evaluations show TrajEvo outperforms previous heuristic methods on the ETH-UCY datasets, and remarkably outperforms both heuristics and deep learning methods when generalizing to the unseen SDD dataset. TrajEvo represents a first step toward automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics. We make our source code publicly available to foster future research at https://github.com/ai4co/trajevo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Entropy Reinforcement Learning for Predictable and Robust Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04193v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simplicity is a critical inductive bias for designing data-driven controllers, especially when robustness is important. Despite the impressive results of deep reinforcement learning in complex control tasks, it is prone to capturing intricate and spurious correlations between observations and actions, leading to failure under slight perturbations to the environment. To tackle this problem, in this work we introduce a novel inductive bias towards simple policies in reinforcement learning. The simplicity inductive bias is introduced by minimizing the entropy of entire action trajectories, corresponding to the number of bits required to describe information in action trajectories after the agent observes state trajectories. Our reinforcement learning agent, Trajectory Entropy Reinforcement Learning, is optimized to minimize the trajectory entropy while maximizing rewards. We show that the trajectory entropy can be effectively estimated by learning a variational parameterized action prediction model, and use the prediction model to construct an information-regularized reward function. Furthermore, we construct a practical algorithm that enables the joint optimization of models, including the policy and the prediction model. Experimental evaluations on several high-dimensional locomotion tasks show that our learned policies produce more cyclical and consistent action trajectories, and achieve superior performance, and robustness to noise and dynamic changes than the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding the evolution of user preferences remains a complex challenge, particularly as their musical tastes change over time. This paper uses the dictionary learning paradigm to model user trajectories across different musical genres. We define a new framework that captures recurring patterns in genre trajectories, called pathlets, enabling the creation of comprehensible trajectory embeddings. We show that pathlet learning reveals relevant listening patterns that can be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. This work improves our understanding of users' interactions with music and opens up avenues of research into user behavior and fostering diversity in recommender systems.

The formulation extends the prize-collecting traveling salesman problem. A tailored genetic algorithm evolves candidate solutions using a fitness function, crossover, and mutation, with constraint enforcement via a penalty method. Differential flatness and clothoid curves are employed to penalize infeasible trajectories efficiently, while the Euler spiral method ensures curvature-continuous trajectories with bounded curvature, enhancing dynamic feasibility and mitigating oscillations typical of minimum-jerk and snap parameterizations. Due to the discrete variable length optimization space, crossover is performed using a dynamic time-warping-based method and extended convex combination with projection. The algorithm's performance is validated through simulations and experiments with a ground vehicle, quadrotor, and quadruped, supported by benchmarking and time-complexity analysis.</p></details> |  |

While diffusion models have shown promise in planning, they are limited to solving tasks similar to those seen in their training data. We propose CompDiffuser, a novel generative approach that can solve new tasks by learning to compositionally stitch together shorter trajectory chunks from previously seen tasks. Our key insight is modeling the trajectory distribution by subdividing it into overlapping chunks and learning their conditional relationships through a single bidirectional diffusion model. This allows information to propagate between segments during generation, ensuring physically consistent connections. We conduct experiments on benchmark tasks of various difficulties, covering different environment sizes, agent state dimension, trajectory types, training data quality, and show that CompDiffuser significantly outperforms existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://comp-diffuser.github.io/</p></details> |

| **[Riemannian Direct Trajectory Optimization of Rigid Bodies on Matrix Lie Groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02323v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing dynamically feasible trajectories for rigid bodies is a fundamental problem in robotics. Although direct trajectory optimization is widely applied to solve this problem, inappropriate parameterizations of rigid body dynamics often result in slow convergence and violations of the intrinsic topological structure of the rotation group. This paper introduces a Riemannian optimization framework for direct trajectory optimization of rigid bodies. We first use the Lie Group Variational Integrator to formulate the discrete rigid body dynamics on matrix Lie groups. We then derive the closed-form first- and second-order Riemannian derivatives of the dynamics. Finally, this work applies a line-search Riemannian Interior Point Method (RIPM) to perform trajectory optimization with general nonlinear constraints. As the optimization is performed on matrix Lie groups, it is correct-by-construction to respect the topological structure of the rotation group and be free of singularities. The paper demonstrates that both the derivative evaluations and Newton steps required to solve the RIPM exhibit linear complexity with respect to the planning horizon and system degrees of freedom. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed method is faster than conventional methods by an order of magnitude in challenging robotics tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16310v4)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.5\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

Traditional modular methods suffer from error propagation, while existing end-to-end models typically employ static one-shot inference paradigms that inadequately capture the dynamic changes of the environment. ARTEMIS takes a different method by generating trajectory waypoints sequentially, preserves critical temporal dependencies while dynamically routing scene-specific queries to specialized expert networks. It effectively relieves trajectory quality degradation issues encountered when guidance information is ambiguous, and overcomes the inherent representational limitations of singular network architectures when processing diverse driving scenarios. Additionally, we use a lightweight batch reallocation strategy that significantly improves the training speed of the Mixture-of-Experts model. Through experiments on the NAVSIM dataset, ARTEMIS exhibits superior competitive performance, achieving 87.0 PDMS and 83.1 EPDMS with ResNet-34 backbone, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error at convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work.

The network has primarily focused on Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Broadcast (ADS-B) data, which provides high-frequency position updates over terrestrial areas. However, the ADS-B signals are limited over oceans and remote regions, where ground-based receivers are scarce. To address these coverage gaps, the OpenSky Network has begun incorporating data from the Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Contract (ADS-C) system, which uses satellite communication to track aircraft positions over oceanic regions and remote areas. In this paper, we analyze a dataset of over 720,000 ADS-C messages collected in 2024 from around 2,600 unique aircraft via the Alphasat satellite, covering Europe, Africa, and parts of the Atlantic Ocean. We present our approach to combining ADS-B and ADS-C data to construct detailed long-haul flight paths, particularly for transatlantic and African routes. Our findings demonstrate that this integration significantly improves trajectory reconstruction accuracy, allowing for better fuel consumption and emissions estimates. We illustrate how combined data captures flight patterns across previously underrepresented regions across Africa. Despite coverage limitations, this work marks an important advancement in providing open access to global flight trajectory data, enabling new research opportunities in air traffic management, environmental impact assessment, and aviation safety.</p></details> |  |

This study addresses the challenges of video-based vessel tracking and prediction by integrating advanced object detection methods, Kalman filters, and spline-based interpolation. However, existing detection systems often misclassify objects in inland waterways due to complex surroundings. A comparative evaluation of tracking algorithms, including BoT-SORT, Deep OC-SORT, and ByeTrack, highlights the robustness of the Kalman filter in providing smoothed trajectories. Experimental results from diverse scenarios demonstrate improved accuracy in predicting vessel movements, which is essential for collision avoidance and situational awareness. The findings underline the necessity of customized datasets and models for inland navigation. Future work will expand the datasets and incorporate vessel classification to refine predictions, supporting both autonomous systems and human operators in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

Despite its significance, research in this domain remains relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories, incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories. We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming existing methods by a considerable margin.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art motion forecasting models rely on large curated datasets with manually annotated or heavily post-processed trajectories. However, building these datasets is costly, generally manual, hard to scale, and lacks reproducibility. They also introduce domain gaps that limit generalization across environments. We introduce PPT (Pretraining with Pseudo-labeled Trajectories), a simple and scalable alternative that uses unprocessed and diverse trajectories automatically generated from off-the-shelf 3D detectors and tracking. Unlike traditional pipelines aiming for clean, single-label annotations, PPT embraces noise and diversity as useful signals for learning robust representations. With optional finetuning on a small amount of labeled data, models pretrained with PPT achieve strong performance across standard benchmarks particularly in low-data regimes, and in cross-domain, end-to-end and multi-class settings. PPT is easy to implement and improves generalization in motion forecasting.

Over the past two decades, researchers have extended these methods to analyze trajectories of humans, animals, and vehicles, studying their behavior and movement across applications. This paper presents whole-trajectory clustering and sub-trajectory clustering algorithms based on DBSCAN line segment clustering, which encompasses two key events: split and merge of line segments. The events are employed by object movement history and the average Euclidean distance between line segments. In this framework, whole-trajectory clustering considers entire entities' trajectories, whereas sub-trajectory clustering employs a sliding window model to identify similar sub-trajectories. Many existing trajectory clustering algorithms respond to temporary anomalies in data by splitting trajectories, which often obscures otherwise consistent clustering patterns and leads to less reliable insights. We introduce the stable trajectory clustering algorithm, which leverages the mean absolute deviation concept to demonstrate that selective omission of transient deviations not only preserves the integrity of clusters but also improves their stability and interpretability. We run all proposed algorithms on real trajectory datasets to illustrate their effectiveness and sensitivity to parameter variations.</p></details> |  |

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/.</p></details> | Work in progress |

This paper introduces a point-oriented online tracking algorithm that improves trajectory continuity and counting reliability in drone-based crowd monitoring. Our method builds on the Simple Online and Real-time Tracking (SORT) framework, replacing the original bounding-box assignment with a point-distance metric. The algorithm is enhanced with three cost-effective techniques: camera motion compensation, altitude-aware assignment, and classification-based trajectory validation. Further, Deep Discriminative Correlation Filters (DDCF) that re-use spatial feature maps from localisation algorithms for increased computational efficiency through neural network resource sharing are integrated to refine object tracking by reducing noise and handling missed detections. The proposed method is evaluated on the DroneCrowd and newly shared UP-COUNT-TRACK datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in tracking metrics, reducing counting errors to 23% and 15%, respectively. The results also indicate a significant reduction of identity switches while maintaining high tracking accuracy, outperforming baseline online trackers and even an offline greedy optimisation method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to the Expert Systems with Applications journal</p></details> |
| **[Kinodynamic Trajectory Following with STELA: Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation & Local Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20009v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation and control are often addressed separately, leading to unsafe execution due to sensing noise, execution errors, and discrepancies between the planning model and reality. Simultaneous control and trajectory estimation using probabilistic graphical models has been proposed as a unified solution to these challenges. Previous work, however, relies heavily on appropriate Gaussian priors and is limited to holonomic robots with linear time-varying models. The current research extends graphical optimization methods to vehicles with arbitrary dynamical models via Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation and Local Adaptation (STELA). The overall approach initializes feasible trajectories using a kinodynamic, sampling-based motion planner. Then, it simultaneously: (i) estimates the past trajectory based on noisy observations, and (ii) adapts the controls to be executed to minimize deviations from the planned, feasible trajectory, while avoiding collisions. The proposed factor graph representation of trajectories in STELA can be applied for any dynamical system given access to first or second-order state update equations, and introduces the duration of execution between two states in the trajectory discretization as an optimization variable. These features provide both generalization and flexibility in trajectory following. In addition to targeting computational efficiency, the proposed strategy performs incremental updates of the factor graph using the iSAM algorithm and introduces a time-window mechanism. This mechanism allows the factor graph to be dynamically updated to operate over a limited history and forward horizon of the planned trajectory. This enables online updates of controls at a minimum of 10Hz. Experiments demonstrate that STELA achieves at least comparable performance to previous frameworks on idealized vehicles with linear dynamics.[...]</p></details> | [Accepted] RSS 2025 |

While, the spin is not directly observable in standard broadcasting videos, we show that it can be inferred from the ball's trajectory in the video. We present a novel method to infer the initial spin and 3D trajectory from the corresponding 2D trajectory in a video. Without ground truth labels for broadcast videos, we train a neural network solely on synthetic data. Due to the choice of our input data representation, physically correct synthetic training data, and using targeted augmentations, the network naturally generalizes to real data. Notably, these simple techniques are sufficient to achieve generalization. No real data at all is required for training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a method for spin and trajectory prediction in simple monocular broadcast videos, achieving an accuracy of 92.0% in spin classification and a 2D reprojection error of 0.19% of the image diagonal.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)</p></details> |

However, existing methods face robotic hardware dependency and control frequency mismatches between teleoperation devices and robotic platforms. Our approach automatically extracts kinematic parameters from unified robot description format (URDF) files, and enables pluggable deployment across diverse robots through uniform interfaces. The proposed interpolation algorithm bridges the frequency gap between low-rate human inputs and high-frequency robotic control commands through online continuous trajectory generation, \n{while requiring no access to the closed, bottom-level control loop}. To enhance trajectory smoothness, we introduce a minimum-stretch spline that optimizes the motion quality. The system further provides precision and rapid modes to accommodate different task requirements. Experiments across various robotic platforms including dual-arm ones demonstrate generality and smooth operation performance of our methods. The code is developed in C++ with python interface, and available at https://github.com/IRMV-Manipulation-Group/UTTG.</p></details> |  |

Existing deep generative models learn from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with increasing data size. More importantly, they often lack control mechanisms to guide the generated trajectories under constraints such as enforcing specific visits. To address these limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem for effectively handling multiple spatiotemporal constraints. We introduce Geo-Llama, a novel LLM finetuning framework that can enforce multiple explicit visit constraints while maintaining contextual coherence of the generated trajectories. In this approach, pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned on trajectory data with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a specific time and location. This strategy enables the model to capture spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders while maintaining flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning with Model Predictive Control for Obstacle Avoidance Considering Prediction Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19193v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel trajectory planner for autonomous robots, specifically designed to enhance navigation by incorporating dynamic obstacle avoidance within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) and Navigation 2 (Nav2) framework. The proposed method utilizes Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a focus on handling the uncertainties associated with the movement prediction of dynamic obstacles. Unlike existing Nav2 trajectory planners which primarily deal with static obstacles or react to the current position of dynamic obstacles, this planner predicts future obstacle positions using a stochastic Vector Auto-Regressive Model (VAR). The obstacles' future positions are represented by probability distributions, and collision avoidance is achieved through constraints based on the Mahalanobis distance, ensuring the robot avoids regions where obstacles are likely to be. This approach considers the robot's kinodynamic constraints, enabling it to track a reference path while adapting to real-time changes in the environment. The paper details the implementation, including obstacle prediction, tracking, and the construction of feasible sets for MPC. Simulation results in a Gazebo environment demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in scenarios where robots must navigate around each other, showing improved collision avoidance capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to IFAC for publication under a Creative Commons Licence CC-BY-NC-ND</p></details> |

Therefore, fin-driven autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can achieve high maneuverability with a smaller number of actuators, but their control is challenging. This study proposes an analytic control allocation method for underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). By integrating an adaptive hybrid feedback controller, we enable an AUV with 4 actuators to move in 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) in simulation and up to 5-DOF in real-world experiments. The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art control allocation techniques in 6-DOF trajectory tracking simulations, exhibiting centimeter-scale accuracy and higher energy and computational efficiency. Real-world pool experiments confirmed the method's robustness and efficacy in tracking complex 3D trajectories, with significant computational efficiency gains 0.007 (ms) vs. 22.28 (ms). Our method offers a balance between performance, energy efficiency, and computational efficiency, showcasing a potential avenue for more effective tracking of a large number of DOF for under-actuated underwater robots.</p></details> |  |

These seek to answer a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in stochastic thermodynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 appendices (10 pages), 4 figures; https://csc.ucdavis.edu/~cmg/compmech/pubs/currents.htm</p></details> |
| **[DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Longitudinal Trajectory Dataset for Automated Vehicle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00009v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Vehicles (AVs) promise significant advances in transportation. Critical to these improvements is understanding AVs' longitudinal behavior, relying heavily on real-world trajectory data. Existing open-source trajectory datasets of AV, however, often fall short in refinement, reliability, and completeness, hindering effective performance metrics analysis and model development. This study addresses these challenges by creating a Unified Longitudinal TRAjectory dataset for AVs (Ultra-AV) to analyze their microscopic longitudinal driving behaviors. This dataset compiles data from 13 distinct sources, encompassing various AV types, test sites, and experiment scenarios. We established a three-step data processing: 1. extraction of longitudinal trajectory data, 2. general data cleaning, and 3. data-specific cleaning to obtain the longitudinal trajectory data and car-following trajectory data. The validity of the processed data is affirmed through performance evaluations across safety, mobility, stability, and sustainability, along with an analysis of the relationships between variables in car-following models. Our work not only furnishes researchers with standardized data and metrics for longitudinal AV behavior studies but also sets guidelines for data collection and model development.</p></details> | NA |

While these methods achieve exceptional performance in defined datasets, they usually rely on the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption and thus tend to be vulnerable to distribution shifts that occur in the real world. In addition, these methods lack explainability due to their black box nature, which poses further challenges in terms of the approval process and social trustworthiness. Therefore, in order to use the capabilities of data-driven statistical AI methods in a reliable and trustworthy manner, the concept of TrustMHE is introduced and investigated in this paper. TrustMHE represents a complementary approach, independent of the underlying AI systems, that combines AI-driven out-of-distribution detection with control-driven moving horizon estimation (MHE) to enable not only detection and monitoring, but also intervention. The effectiveness of the proposed TrustMHE is evaluated and proven in three simulation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), JCluj-Napoca, Romania, June 22-25, 2025</p></details> |

While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Reupl...</summary><p>Reuploaded with new version-- equation 16 was incorrect</p></details> |

However, they have seen limited application in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. This is due to the difficulty in reasoning about collisions in radiance models and the computational complexity associated with operating in dense models. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer operating in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method to rigorously upper-bound the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Then, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables efficient computation of this collision bound. Finally, this paper presents a method to optimize trajectories that avoid collisions in a Gaussian Splat. Experiments show that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in cluttered environments. The proposed system is also tested on a real-world robot manipulator.

While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel mixed Bernstein-Fourier approximation framework tailored explicitly for optimal motion planning. Our proposed methodology leverages the uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials for nonperiodic behaviors while effectively capturing periodic dynamics through Fourier series. Theoretical results are established, including uniform convergence proofs for approximations of functions, derivatives, and integrals, as well as detailed error bound analyses. We further introduce a regulated least squares approach for determining approximation coefficients, enhancing numerical stability and practical applicability. Within an optimal control context, we establish feasibility and consistency of approximated solutions to their continuous counterparts. We also extend the covector mapping theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for approximating dual variables crucial in verifying the necessary optimality conditions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Comprehensive numerical examples illustrate the method's superior performance, demonstrating substantial improvements in computational efficiency and precision in scenarios with complex periodic constraints and dynamics. Our mixed Bernstein-Fourier methodology thus presents a robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient approach for advanced optimal trajectory planning in autonomous systems.</p></details> | 49 pages, 9 figures |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions. Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories. We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 30 figures, Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

There is a urgent need to minimize the data size in LLM training. Compared with data selection method, the data distillation method aims to synthesize a small number of data samples to achieve the training effect of the full data set and has better flexibility. Despite its successes in computer vision, the discreteness of text data has hitherto stymied its exploration in natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we proposed a method that involves learning pseudo prompt data based on trajectory matching and finding its nearest neighbor ID to achieve cross-architecture transfer. During the distillation process, we introduce a regularization loss to improve the robustness of our distilled data. To our best knowledge, this is the first data distillation work suitable for text generation tasks such as instruction tuning. Evaluations on two benchmarks, including ARC-Easy and MMLU instruction tuning datasets, established the superiority of our distillation approach over the SOTA data selection method LESS. Furthermore, our method demonstrates a good transferability over LLM structures (i.e., OPT to Llama).</p></details> |  |

Our framework begins by generating panoptic occupancy local semantic maps and accurate localization information from data aligned between a monocular camera, IMU, and GPS. This information is combined with input terrain point clouds or preloaded terrain information to initialize the planning process. We propose the Radiant Field-Informed Coverage Planning algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion field model to dynamically adjust the robot's coverage trajectory and speed based on environmental attributes such as dirtiness and dryness. By modeling the spatial influence of the robot's actions using a Gaussian field, ensures a speed-optimized, uniform coverage trajectory while adapting to varying environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |

Even well-trained machine learning models may produce unreliable predictions due to discrepancies between training data and real-world conditions encountered during inference. In particular, the training dataset tends to overrepresent common scenes (e.g., straight lanes) while underrepresenting less frequent ones (e.g., traffic circles). In addition, it often overlooks unpredictable real-world events such as sudden braking or falling objects. To ensure safety, it is critical to detect in real-time when a model's predictions become unreliable. Leveraging the intuition that in-distribution (ID) scenes exhibit error patterns similar to training data, while out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes do not, we introduce a principled, real-time approach for OOD detection by framing it as a change-point detection problem. We address the challenging settings where the OOD scenes are deceptive, meaning that they are not easily detectable by human intuitions. Our lightweight solutions can handle the occurrence of OOD at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |

In practice, safety constraints, including cost functions and budgets, are unknown or hard to specify, as it requires anticipation of all possible unsafe behaviors. We therefore address a general setting where the true safety definition is unknown, and has to be learned from sparsely labeled data. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety model that performs credit assignment to estimate each decision step's impact on the overall safety using a dataset of diverse trajectories and their corresponding binary safety labels (i.e., whether the corresponding trajectory is safe/unsafe). Second, we illustrate the architecture of our safety model to demonstrate its ability to learn a separate safety score for each timestep. Third, we reformulate the safe RL problem using the proposed safety model and derive an effective algorithm to optimize a safe yet rewarding policy. Finally, our empirical results corroborate our findings and show that this approach is effective in satisfying unknown safety definition, and scalable to various continuous control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SILM: A Subjective Intent Based Low-Latency Framework for Multiple Traffic Participants Joint Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16377v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a fundamental technology for advanced autonomous driving systems and represents one of the most challenging problems in the field of cognitive intelligence. Accurately predicting the future trajectories of each traffic participant is a prerequisite for building high safety and high reliability decision-making, planning, and control capabilities in autonomous driving. However, existing methods often focus solely on the motion of other traffic participants without considering the underlying intent behind that motion, which increases the uncertainty in trajectory prediction. Autonomous vehicles operate in real-time environments, meaning that trajectory prediction algorithms must be able to process data and generate predictions in real-time. While many existing methods achieve high accuracy, they often struggle to effectively handle heterogeneous traffic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Subjective Intent-based Low-latency framework for Multiple traffic participants joint trajectory prediction. Our method explicitly incorporates the subjective intent of traffic participants based on their key points, and predicts the future trajectories jointly without map, which ensures promising performance while significantly reducing the prediction latency. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset designed specifically for trajectory prediction. Related code and dataset will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

As this is a novel task, there is currently no relevant dataset available in the community. To address this gap, we first devised a new visualization language called Trajectory Visualization Language (TVL) to facilitate querying trajectory data and generating visualizations. Building on this foundation, we further proposed a dataset construction method that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with human efforts to create high-quality data. Specifically, we first generate TVLs using a comprehensive and systematic process, and then label each TVL with corresponding natural language questions using LLMs. This process results in the creation of the first large-scale Text-to-TrajVis dataset, named TrajVL, which contains 18,140 (question, TVL) pairs. Based on this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of multiple LLMs (GPT, Qwen, Llama, etc.) on this task. The experimental results demonstrate that this task is both feasible and highly challenging and merits further exploration within the research community.</p></details> |  |

Previous autonomous driving world models either directly feed the trajectory or discrete control signals into the generation pipeline, leading to poor alignment between the control inputs and the implicit features of the 2D base generative model, which results in low-fidelity video outputs. Some methods use coarse textual commands or discrete vehicle control signals, which lack the precision to guide fine-grained, trajectory-specific video generation, making them unsuitable for evaluating actual autonomous driving algorithms. DriVerse introduces explicit trajectory guidance in two complementary forms: it tokenizes trajectories into textual prompts using a predefined trend vocabulary for seamless language integration, and converts 3D trajectories into 2D spatial motion priors to enhance control over static content within the driving scene. To better handle dynamic objects, we further introduce a lightweight motion alignment module, which focuses on the inter-frame consistency of dynamic pixels, significantly enhancing the temporal coherence of moving elements over long sequences. With minimal training and no need for additional data, DriVerse outperforms specialized models on future video generation tasks across both the nuScenes and Waymo datasets. The code and models will be released to the public.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Dynamic Intent Queries for Motion Transformer-based Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15766v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, accurately predicting the movements of other traffic participants is crucial, as it significantly influences a vehicle's planning processes. Modern trajectory prediction models strive to interpret complex patterns and dependencies from agent and map data. The Motion Transformer (MTR) architecture and subsequent work define the most accurate methods in common benchmarks such as the Waymo Open Motion Benchmark. The MTR model employs pre-generated static intention points as initial goal points for trajectory prediction. However, the static nature of these points frequently leads to misalignment with map data in specific traffic scenarios, resulting in unfeasible or unrealistic goal points. Our research addresses this limitation by integrating scene-specific dynamic intention points into the MTR model. This adaptation of the MTR model was trained and evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating dynamic intention points has a significant positive impact on trajectory prediction accuracy, especially for predictions over long time horizons. Furthermore, we analyze the impact on ground truth trajectories which are not compliant with the map data or are illegal maneuvers.</p></details> |  |

Agents and their social interactions have been quantified and modeled by researchers from various perspectives; however, substantial limitations exist in the current work due to the inherent high uncertainty of agent intentions and the complex higher-order influences among neighboring groups. SocialMOIF is proposed to tackle these challenges, concentrating on the higher-order intention interactions among neighboring groups while reinforcing the primary role of first-order intention interactions between neighbors and the target agent. This method develops a multi-order intention fusion model to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of both direct and indirect intention information. Within SocialMOIF, a trajectory distribution approximator is designed to guide the trajectories toward values that align more closely with the actual data, thereby enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, a global trajectory optimizer is introduced to enable more accurate and efficient parallel predictions. By incorporating a novel loss function that accounts for distance and direction during training, experimental results demonstrate that the model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics in both dynamic and static datasets.</p></details> | 11 pages,6 figures |

| **[Customizing a Large Language Model for VHDL Design of High-Performance Microprocessors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09610v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in hardware design has taken off in recent years, principally through its incorporation in tools that increase chip designer productivity. There has been considerable discussion about the use of LLMs in RTL specifications of chip designs, for which the two most popular languages are Verilog and VHDL. LLMs and their use in Verilog design has received significant attention due to the higher popularity of the language, but little attention so far has been given to VHDL despite its continued popularity in the industry. There has also been little discussion about the unique needs of organizations that engage in high-performance processor design, and techniques to deploy AI solutions in these settings. In this paper, we describe our journey in developing a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically for the purpose of explaining VHDL code, a task that has particular importance in an organization with decades of experience and assets in high-performance processor design. We show how we developed test sets specific to our needs and used them for evaluating models as we performed extended pretraining (EPT) of a base LLM. Expert evaluation of the code explanations produced by the EPT model increased to 69% compared to a base model rating of 43%. We further show how we developed an LLM-as-a-judge to gauge models similar to expert evaluators. This led us to deriving and evaluating a host of new models, including an instruction-tuned version of the EPT model with an expected expert evaluator rating of 71%. Our experiments also indicate that with the potential use of newer base models, this rating can be pushed to 85% and beyond. We conclude with a discussion on further improving the quality of hardware design LLMs using exciting new developments in the Generative AI world.</p></details> |  |
| **[WorldView-Bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Global Cultural Perspectives in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09595v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly trained and aligned in ways that reinforce Western-centric epistemologies and socio-cultural norms, leading to cultural homogenization and limiting their ability to reflect global civilizational plurality. Existing benchmarking frameworks fail to adequately capture this bias, as they rely on rigid, closed-form assessments that overlook the complexity of cultural inclusivity. To address this, we introduce WorldView-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Global Cultural Inclusivity (GCI) in LLMs by analyzing their ability to accommodate diverse worldviews. Our approach is grounded in the Multiplex Worldview proposed by Senturk et al., which distinguishes between Uniplex models, reinforcing cultural homogenization, and Multiplex models, which integrate diverse perspectives. WorldView-Bench measures Cultural Polarization, the exclusion of alternative perspectives, through free-form generative evaluation rather than conventional categorical benchmarks. We implement applied multiplexity through two intervention strategies: (1) Contextually-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where system prompts embed multiplexity principles, and (2) Multi-Agent System (MAS)-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where multiple LLM agents representing distinct cultural perspectives collaboratively generate responses. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in Perspectives Distribution Score (PDS) entropy from 13% at baseline to 94% with MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, alongside a shift toward positive sentiment (67.7%) and enhanced cultural balance. These findings highlight the potential of multiplex-aware AI evaluation in mitigating cultural bias in LLMs, paving the way for more inclusive and ethically aligned AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

To tackle the substantial challenge of addressing hallucinations for LLM-based ontology matching (OM) systems, we introduce a new benchmark dataset OAEI-LLM-T. The dataset evolves from seven TBox datasets in the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), capturing hallucinations of ten different LLMs performing OM tasks. These OM-specific hallucinations are organised into two primary categories and six sub-categories. We showcase the usefulness of the dataset in constructing an LLM leaderboard for OM tasks and for fine-tuning LLMs used in OM tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables, 2 prompt templates</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Multimedia Generated by Large AI Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00045v5)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large AI Models (LAIMs), particularly diffusion models and large language models, has marked a new era where AI-generated multimedia is increasingly integrated into various aspects of daily life. Although beneficial in numerous fields, this content presents significant risks, including potential misuse, societal disruptions, and ethical concerns. Consequently, detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs has become crucial, with a marked rise in related research. Despite this, there remains a notable gap in systematic surveys that focus specifically on detecting LAIM-generated multimedia. Addressing this, we provide the first survey to comprehensively cover existing research on detecting multimedia (such as text, images, videos, audio, and multimodal content) created by LAIMs. Specifically, we introduce a novel taxonomy for detection methods, categorized by media modality, and aligned with two perspectives: pure detection (aiming to enhance detection performance) and beyond detection (adding attributes like generalizability, robustness, and interpretability to detectors). Additionally, we have presented a brief overview of generation mechanisms, public datasets, online detection tools, and evaluation metrics to provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in this field. Most importantly, we offer a focused analysis from a social media perspective to highlight their broader societal impact. Furthermore, we identify current challenges in detection and propose directions for future research that address unexplored, ongoing, and emerging issues in detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs. Our aim for this survey is to fill an academic gap and contribute to global AI security efforts, helping to ensure the integrity of information in the digital realm.

| **[I Know What You Said: Unveiling Hardware Cache Side-Channels in Local Large Language Model Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06738v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be deployed locally have recently gained popularity for privacy-sensitive tasks, with companies such as Meta, Google, and Intel playing significant roles in their development. However, the security of local LLMs through the lens of hardware cache side-channels remains unexplored. In this paper, we unveil novel side-channel vulnerabilities in local LLM inference: token value and token position leakage, which can expose both the victim's input and output text, thereby compromising user privacy. Specifically, we found that adversaries can infer the token values from the cache access patterns of the token embedding operation, and deduce the token positions from the timing of autoregressive decoding phases. To demonstrate the potential of these leaks, we design a novel eavesdropping attack framework targeting both open-source and proprietary LLM inference systems. The attack framework does not directly interact with the victim's LLM and can be executed without privilege. We evaluate the attack on a range of practical local LLM deployments (e.g., Llama, Falcon, and Gemma), and the results show that our attack achieves promising accuracy. The restored output and input text have an average edit distance of 5.2% and 17.3% to the ground truth, respectively. Furthermore, the reconstructed texts achieve average cosine similarity scores of 98.7% (input) and 98.0% (output).</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for review in January 22, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Construction and Application of Materials Knowledge Graph in Multidisciplinary Materials Science via Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03080v4)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge in materials science is widely dispersed across extensive scientific literature, posing significant challenges to the efficient discovery and integration of new materials. Traditional methods, often reliant on costly and time-consuming experimental approaches, further complicate rapid innovation. Addressing these challenges, the integration of artificial intelligence with materials science has opened avenues for accelerating the discovery process, though it also demands precise annotation, data extraction, and traceability of information. To tackle these issues, this article introduces the Materials Knowledge Graph (MKG), which utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques integrated with large language models to extract and systematically organize a decade's worth of high-quality research into structured triples, contains 162,605 nodes and 731,772 edges. MKG categorizes information into comprehensive labels such as Name, Formula, and Application, structured around a meticulously designed ontology, thus enhancing data usability and integration. By implementing network-based algorithms, MKG not only facilitates efficient link prediction but also significantly reduces reliance on traditional experimental methods. This structured approach not only streamlines materials research but also lays the groundwork for more sophisticated science knowledge graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables; Accepted by 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Card Sorting Simulator: Augmenting Design of Logical Information Architectures with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09478v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Card sorting is a common ideation technique that elicits information on users' mental organization of content and functionality by having them sort items into categories. For more robust card sorting research, digital card sorting tools could benefit from providing quick automated feedback. Our objective of this research is to advance toward an instrument that applies artificial intelligence (AI) to augment card sorting. For this purpose, we develop the Card Sorting Simulator, a prototype tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate informative categorizations of cards. To illuminate how aligned the simulation is with card sorting by actual participants, and to inform the instrument's design decisions, we conducted a generalizability-focused comparative study. We obtained 28 pre-existing card sorting studies from real practitioners, comprising 1,399 participants, along with diverse contents and origins. With this dataset, we conducted a comprehensive and nuanced analysis of the agreement between actual card sorting results (clusterings of cards) and synthetic clusterings across a multitude of LLMs and prompt designs. Mutual information scores indicate a good degree of agreement to real result clustering, although similarity matrices also demonstrate inconsistencies from mental models, which can be attributed to their top-down nature. Furthermore, the number of cards or complexity of their labels impact the accuracy of its simulation. These findings bolster the case for AI augmentation in card sorting research as a source of meaningful preliminary feedback and highlight the need for further study for the development and validation of intelligent user research tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating GPT- and Reasoning-based Large Language Models on Physics Olympiad Problems: Surpassing Human Performance and Implications for Educational Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09438v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are now widely accessible, reaching learners at all educational levels. This development has raised concerns that their use may circumvent essential learning processes and compromise the integrity of established assessment formats. In physics education, where problem solving plays a central role in instruction and assessment, it is therefore essential to understand the physics-specific problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. Such understanding is key to informing responsible and pedagogically sound approaches to integrating LLMs into instruction and assessment. This study therefore compares the problem-solving performance of a general-purpose LLM (GPT-4o, using varying prompting techniques) and a reasoning-optimized model (o1-preview) with that of participants of the German Physics Olympiad, based on a set of well-defined Olympiad problems. In addition to evaluating the correctness of the generated solutions, the study analyzes characteristic strengths and limitations of LLM-generated solutions. The findings of this study indicate that both tested LLMs (GPT-4o and o1-preview) demonstrate advanced problem-solving capabilities on Olympiad-type physics problems, on average outperforming the human participants. Prompting techniques had little effect on GPT-4o's performance, while o1-preview almost consistently outperformed both GPT-4o and the human benchmark. Based on these findings, the study discusses implications for the design of summative and formative assessment in physics education, including how to uphold assessment integrity and support students in critically engaging with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[FaceShield: Explainable Face Anti-Spoofing with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09415v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is crucial for protecting facial recognition systems from presentation attacks. Previous methods approached this task as a classification problem, lacking interpretability and reasoning behind the predicted results. Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and decision-making in visual tasks. However, there is currently no universal and comprehensive MLLM and dataset specifically designed for FAS task. To address this gap, we propose FaceShield, a MLLM for FAS, along with the corresponding pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, FaceShield-pre10K and FaceShield-sft45K. FaceShield is capable of determining the authenticity of faces, identifying types of spoofing attacks, providing reasoning for its judgments, and detecting attack areas. Specifically, we employ spoof-aware vision perception (SAVP) that incorporates both the original image and auxiliary information based on prior knowledge. We then use an prompt-guided vision token masking (PVTM) strategy to random mask vision tokens, thereby improving the model's generalization ability. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating that FaceShield significantly outperforms previous deep learning models and general MLLMs on four FAS tasks, i.e., coarse-grained classification, fine-grained classification, reasoning, and attack localization. Our instruction datasets, protocols, and codes will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this problem, we present SingNet, an extensive, diverse, and in-the-wild singing voice dataset. Specifically, we propose a data processing pipeline to extract ready-to-use training data from sample packs and songs on the internet, forming 3000 hours of singing voices in various languages and styles. Furthermore, to facilitate the use and demonstrate the effectiveness of SingNet, we pre-train and open-source various state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on Wav2vec2, BigVGAN, and NSF-HiFiGAN based on our collected singing voice data. We also conduct benchmark experiments on Automatic Lyric Transcription (ALT), Neural Vocoder, and Singing Voice Conversion (SVC).

| **[ThreatModeling-LLM: Automating Threat Modeling using Large Language Models for Banking System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17058v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Threat modeling is a crucial component of cybersecurity, particularly for industries such as banking, where the security of financial data is paramount. Traditional threat modeling approaches require expert intervention and manual effort, often leading to inefficiencies and human error. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising avenue for automating these processes, enhancing both efficiency and efficacy. However, this transition is not straightforward due to three main challenges: (1) the lack of publicly available, domain-specific datasets, (2) the need for tailored models to handle complex banking system architectures, and (3) the requirement for real-time, adaptive mitigation strategies that align with compliance standards like NIST 800-53. In this paper, we introduce ThreatModeling-LLM, a novel and adaptable framework that automates threat modeling for banking systems using LLMs. ThreatModeling-LLM operates in three stages: 1) dataset creation, 2) prompt engineering and 3) model fine-tuning. We first generate a benchmark dataset using Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool (TMT). Then, we apply Chain of Thought (CoT) and Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO) on the pre-trained LLMs to optimize the initial prompt. Lastly, we fine-tune the LLM using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) based on the benchmark dataset and the optimized prompt to improve the threat identification and mitigation generation capabilities of pre-trained LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We study estimation of the model parameters based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, implemented jointly with the Kalman smoother which gives estimates of the factors. We establish the consistency of the estimated loadings and factor matrices as the sample size $T$ and the matrix dimensions $p_1$ and $p_2$ diverge to infinity. We then illustrate two immediate extensions of this approach to: (a) the case of arbitrary patterns of missing data and (b) the presence of common stochastic trends. The finite sample properties of the estimators are assessed through a large simulation study and two applications on: (i) a financial dataset of volatility proxies and (ii) a macroeconomic dataset covering the main euro area countries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Clinical Competencies of Large Language Models with a General Practice Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17599v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable potential in general practice. However, existing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks primarily depend on exam-style or simplified question-answer formats, lacking a competency-based structure aligned with the real-world clinical responsibilities encountered in general practice. Consequently, the extent to which LLMs can reliably fulfill the duties of general practitioners (GPs) remains uncertain. In this work, we propose a novel evaluation framework to assess the capability of LLMs to function as GPs. Based on this framework, we introduce a general practice benchmark (GPBench), whose data are meticulously annotated by domain experts in accordance with routine clinical practice standards. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art LLMs and analyze their competencies. Our findings indicate that current LLMs are not yet ready for deployment in such settings without human oversight, and further optimization specifically tailored to the daily responsibilities of GPs is essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[EDBench: Large-Scale Electron Density Data for Molecular Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09262v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing molecular machine learning force fields (MLFFs) generally focus on the learning of atoms, molecules, and simple quantum chemical properties (such as energy and force), but ignore the importance of electron density (ED) $\rho(r)$ in accurately understanding molecular force fields (MFFs). ED describes the probability of finding electrons at specific locations around atoms or molecules, which uniquely determines all ground state properties (such as energy, molecular structure, etc.) of interactive multi-particle systems according to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. However, the calculation of ED relies on the time-consuming first-principles density functional theory (DFT) which leads to the lack of large-scale ED data and limits its application in MLFFs. In this paper, we introduce EDBench, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of ED designed to advance learning-based research at the electronic scale. Built upon the PCQM4Mv2, EDBench provides accurate ED data, covering 3.3 million molecules. To comprehensively evaluate the ability of models to understand and utilize electronic information, we design a suite of ED-centric benchmark tasks spanning prediction, retrieval, and generation. Our evaluation on several state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that learning from EDBench is not only feasible but also achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we show that learning-based method can efficiently calculate ED with comparable precision while significantly reducing the computational cost relative to traditional DFT calculations. All data and benchmarks from EDBench will be freely available, laying a robust foundation for ED-driven drug discovery and materials science.</p></details> |  |

Supervised Deep Learning: A Comparative Study on CT-Based Intracranial Hemorrhage Subtyping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09252v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Introduction: Timely identification of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) subtypes on non-contrast computed tomography is critical for prognosis prediction and therapeutic decision-making, yet remains challenging due to low contrast and blurring boundaries. This study evaluates the performance of zero-shot multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) compared to traditional deep learning methods in ICH binary classification and subtyping. Methods: We utilized a dataset provided by RSNA, comprising 192 NCCT volumes. The study compares various MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2, with conventional deep learning models, including ResNet50 and Vision Transformer. Carefully crafted prompts were used to guide MLLMs in tasks such as ICH presence, subtype classification, localization, and volume estimation. Results: The results indicate that in the ICH binary classification task, traditional deep learning models outperform MLLMs comprehensively. For subtype classification, MLLMs also exhibit inferior performance compared to traditional deep learning models, with Gemini 2.0 Flash achieving an macro-averaged precision of 0.41 and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.31. Conclusion: While MLLMs excel in interactive capabilities, their overall accuracy in ICH subtyping is inferior to deep networks. However, MLLMs enhance interpretability through language interactions, indicating potential in medical imaging analysis. Future efforts will focus on model refinement and developing more precise MLLMs to improve performance in three-dimensional medical image processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Larger the Merrier? Efficient Large AI Model Inference in Wireless Edge Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09214v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for large artificial intelligence model (LAIM) services is driving a paradigm shift from traditional cloud-based inference to edge-based inference for low-latency, privacy-preserving applications. In particular, edge-device co-inference, which partitions LAIMs between edge devices and servers, has emerged as a promising strategy for resource-efficient LAIM execution in wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate a pruning-aware LAIM co-inference scheme, where a pre-trained LAIM is pruned and partitioned into on-device and on-server sub-models for deployment. For analysis, we first prove that the LAIM output distortion is upper bounded by its parameter distortion. Then, we derive a lower bound on parameter distortion via rate-distortion theory, analytically capturing the relationship between pruning ratio and co-inference performance. Next, based on the analytical results, we formulate an LAIM co-inference distortion bound minimization problem by jointly optimizing the pruning ratio, transmit power, and computation frequency under system latency, energy, and available resource constraints. Moreover, we propose an efficient algorithm to tackle the considered highly non-convex problem. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design. In particular, model parameter distortion is shown to provide a reliable bound on output distortion. Also, the proposed joint pruning ratio and resource management design achieves superior performance in balancing trade-offs among inference performance, system latency, and energy consumption compared with benchmark schemes, such as fully on-device and on-server inference. Moreover, the split point is shown to play a critical role in system performance optimization under heterogeneous and resource-limited edge environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical and Experimental Assessment of Large Beam Codebook at mmWave Devices: How Much is Enough?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09162v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern millimeter wave (mmWave) transceivers come with a large number of antennas, each of which can support thousands of phase shifter configurations. This capability enables beam sweeping with fine angular resolution, but results in large codebook sizes that can span more than six orders of magnitude. On the other hand, the mobility of user terminals and their randomly changing orientations require constantly adjusting the beam direction. A key focus of recent research has been on the design of beam sweeping codebooks that balance a trade-off between the achievable gain and the beam search time, governed by the codebook size. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which a large codebook can be reduced to fewer steering vectors while covering the entire angular space and maintaining performance close to the maximum array gain. We derive a closed-form expression for the angular coverage range of a steering vector, subject to maintaining a gain loss within \(\gamma\) dB (e.g., 2\, dB) with respect to the maximum gain achieved by an infinitely large codebook. We demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that a large beam-steering codebooks (such as the \(1024^{16}\) set considered in our experiment) can be reduced to just a few steering vectors. This framework serves as a proof that only a few steering vectors are sufficient to achieve near-maximum gain, challenging the common belief that a large codebook with fine angular resolution is essential to fully reap the benefits of an antenna array.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

This could be attributed to the lack of high-quality schematic-netlist training data. Existing work such as AMSnet applies schematic parsing to generate netlists. However, these methods rely on hard-coded heuristics and are difficult to apply to complex or noisy schematics in this paper. We therefore propose a novel net detection mechanism based on segmentation with high robustness. The proposed method also recovers positional information, allowing digital reconstruction of schematics. We then expand AMSnet dataset with schematic images from various sources and create AMSnet 2.0. AMSnet 2.0 contains 2,686 circuits with schematic images, Spectre-formatted netlists, OpenAccess digital schematics, and positional information for circuit components and nets, whereas AMSnet only includes 792 circuits with SPICE netlists but no digital schematics.</p></details> | accepted by LAD25 |
| **[FAS: Fast ANN-SNN Conversion for Spiking Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04405v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Large Language Models have been shown as a good alternative to LLMs in various scenarios. Existing methods for creating Spiking LLMs, i.e., direct training and ANN-SNN conversion, often suffer from performance degradation and relatively high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose a novel Fast ANN-SNN conversion strategy (FAS) that transforms LLMs into spiking LLMs in two stages. The first stage employs a full-parameter fine-tuning of pre-trained models, so it does not need any direct training from scratch. The second stage introduces a coarse-to-fine calibration method to reduce conversion errors and improve accuracy. Experiments on both language and vision-language tasks across four different scales of LLMs demonstrate that FAS can achieve state-of-the-art performance yet with significantly reduced inference latency and computational costs. Notably, FAS only takes eight timesteps to achieve an accuracy of 3\% higher than that of the OPT-7B model, while reducing energy consumption by 96.63\%.

These NP-hard problems have far-reaching applications, yet the non-convex cases have received limited attention in the literature. To address this gap, we introduce a closed-form formula for single-variable changes, establishing novel necessary and sufficient conditions for 1-Opt local improvement in UQIP and CQIP. We develop a simple local and sophisticated tabu search with an oscillation strategy tailored for large-scale problems. Experimental results on instances with up to 8000 variables demonstrate the efficiency of these strategies, producing high-quality solutions within a short time.

This task presents unique challenges, including whole-body coordination to avoid collisions and managing the dynamics of bulky, heavy objects. In this work, we present RobotMover, a learning-based system for large object manipulation that uses human-object interaction demonstrations to train robot control policies. RobotMover formulates the manipulation problem as imitation learning using a simplified spatial representation called the Interaction Chain, which captures essential interaction dynamics in a way that generalizes across different robot bodies. We incorporate this Interaction Chain into a reward function and train policies in simulation using domain randomization to enable zero-shot transfer to real-world robots. The resulting policies allow a Spot robot to manipulate various large objects, including chairs, tables, and standing lamps. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world, we show that RobotMover achieves strong performance in terms of capability, robustness, and controllability, outperforming both learned and teleoperation baselines. The system also supports practical applications by combining learned policies with simple planning modules to perform long-horizon object transport and rearrangement tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-like Cognitive Generalization for Large Models via Brain-in-the-loop Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09085v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly large-scale language models, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image and natural language understanding. Although scaling up model parameters with increasing volume of training data has progressively improved DNN capabilities, achieving complex cognitive abilities - such as understanding abstract concepts, reasoning, and adapting to novel scenarios, which are intrinsic to human cognition - remains a major challenge. In this study, we show that brain-in-the-loop supervised learning, utilizing a small set of brain signals, can effectively transfer human conceptual structures to DNNs, significantly enhancing their comprehension of abstract and even unseen concepts. Experimental results further indicate that the enhanced cognitive capabilities lead to substantial performance gains in challenging tasks, including few-shot/zero-shot learning and out-of-distribution recognition, while also yielding highly interpretable concept representations. These findings highlight that human-in-the-loop supervision can effectively augment the complex cognitive abilities of large models, offering a promising pathway toward developing more human-like cognitive abilities in artificial systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models on Fine-Grained Image Tasks: A Comprehensive Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14988v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal perception capabilities, garnering significant attention. While numerous evaluation studies have emerged, assessing LVLMs both holistically and on specialized tasks, fine-grained image tasks-fundamental to computer vision-remain largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce a comprehensive fine-grained evaluation benchmark, i.e., FG-BMK, comprising 1.01 million questions and 0.33 million images. Our evaluation systematically examines LVLMs from both human-oriented and machine-oriented perspectives, focusing on their semantic recognition and fine-grained feature representation capabilities. Through extensive experiments on twelve representative LVLMs/VLMs, we uncover key findings regarding the influence of training paradigms, modality alignment, perturbation susceptibility, and fine-grained category reasoning on task performance. This work provides critical insights into the limitations of current LVLMs and offers guidance for future data construction and model design in the development of more advanced LVLMs. Our code is open-source and available at https://github.com/SEU-VIPGroup/FG-BMK.</p></details> |  |
| **[PriFFT: Privacy-preserving Federated Fine-tuning of Large Language Models via Hybrid Secret Sharing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03146v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) raises privacy concerns due to the risk of exposing sensitive training data. Federated learning (FL) mitigates this risk by keeping training samples on local devices, while facing the following problems in privacy-preserving federated fine-tuning. (i) Recent studies show that adversaries can still infer private information in FL. (ii) LLM parameters are shared publicly during federated fine-tuning, while developers are often reluctant to disclose these parameters, posing further security challenges. (iii) Existing works focus on secure inference of LLMs but do not consider privacy-preserving fine-tuning. Inspired by the above problems, we propose PriFFT, a privacy-preserving federated fine-tuning mechanism, to protect both the model parameters and users' privacy. Due to considerable LLM parameters, we present hybrid secret sharing combining arithmetic secret sharing (ASS) and function secret sharing (FSS) to build secure operations and implement secure layers and activation for privacy-preserving fine-tuning. To improve the efficiency of privacy-preserving federated fine-tuning of LLMs, we optimize several secure computation protocols based on FSS, including reciprocal calculation, tensor products, natural exponentiation, softmax, sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and dropout. The hybrid secret sharing enables PriFFT to apply our optimized FSS protocols while combining ASS protocols to support complex computation without extra communication. The optimized protocols reduce execution time up to 62.5% and communication overhead up to 70.7% compared to existing protocols. Besides, PriFFT reduces execution time and communication overhead in privacy-preserving fine-tuning up to 59.1%$ and 77.0%$ without accuracy drop compared to the existing secret sharing methods.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in evaluating and enhancing multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Focusing on task-specific scenarios, from instruction following in diverse domains such as math and coding to complex conversational engagements in roleplay, healthcare, education, and even adversarial jailbreak settings, we systematically examine the challenges of maintaining context, coherence, fairness, and responsiveness over prolonged dialogues. The paper organizes current benchmarks and datasets into coherent categories that reflect the evolving landscape of multi-turn dialogue evaluation. In addition, we review a range of enhancement methodologies under multi-turn settings, including model-centric strategies (contextual learning, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and new architectures), external integration approaches (memory-augmented, retrieval-based methods, and knowledge graph), and agent-based techniques for collaborative interactions. Finally, we discuss open challenges and propose future directions for research to further advance the robustness and effectiveness of multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Related resources and papers are available at https://github.com/yubol-cmu/Awesome-Multi-Turn-LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fusing Bidirectional Chains of Thought and Reward Mechanisms A Method for Enhancing Question-Answering Capabilities of Large Language Models for Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08167v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has provided significant support and opportunities for the advancement of domain-specific LLMs. However, fine-tuning these large models using Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) data inevitably faces challenges such as bias, incorrect knowledge inheritance, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose a novel training method that integrates a bidirectional chains of thought and a reward mechanism. This method is built upon ICH-Qwen, a large language model specifically designed for the field of intangible cultural heritage. The proposed method enables the model to not only perform forward reasoning but also enhances the accuracy of the generated answers by utilizing reverse questioning and reverse reasoning to activate the model's latent knowledge. Additionally, a reward mechanism is introduced during training to optimize the decision-making process. This mechanism improves the quality of the model's outputs through structural and content evaluations with different weighting schemes. We conduct comparative experiments on ICH-Qwen, with results demonstrating that our method outperforms 0-shot, step-by-step reasoning, knowledge distillation, and question augmentation methods in terms of accuracy, Bleu-4, and Rouge-L scores on the question-answering task. Furthermore, the paper highlights the effectiveness of combining the bidirectional chains of thought and reward mechanism through ablation experiments. In addition, a series of generalizability experiments are conducted, with results showing that the proposed method yields improvements on various domain-specific datasets and advanced models in areas such as Finance, Wikidata, and StrategyQA. This demonstrates that the method is adaptable to multiple domains and provides a valuable approach for model training in future applications across diverse fields.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Comprehensive Analysis of Large Language Model Outputs: Similarity, Diversity, and Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09056v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a major step toward artificial general intelligence, significantly advancing our ability to interact with technology. While LLMs perform well on Natural Language Processing tasks -- such as translation, generation, code writing, and summarization -- questions remain about their output similarity, variability, and ethical implications. For instance, how similar are texts generated by the same model? How does this compare across different models? And which models best uphold ethical standards? To investigate, we used 5{,}000 prompts spanning diverse tasks like generation, explanation, and rewriting. This resulted in approximately 3 million texts from 12 LLMs, including proprietary and open-source systems from OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Mistral. Key findings include: (1) outputs from the same LLM are more similar to each other than to human-written texts; (2) models like WizardLM-2-8x22b generate highly similar outputs, while GPT-4 produces more varied responses; (3) LLM writing styles differ significantly, with Llama 3 and Mistral showing higher similarity, and GPT-4 standing out for distinctiveness; (4) differences in vocabulary and tone underscore the linguistic uniqueness of LLM-generated content; (5) some LLMs demonstrate greater gender balance and reduced bias. These results offer new insights into the behavior and diversity of LLM outputs, helping guide future development and ethical evaluation.</p></details> |  |

In addition, the penetration testing (PT) process, with its trial-and-error nature, is limited by existing frameworks that lack mechanisms to learn from previous failed operations, restricting adaptive improvement of PT strategies. To address these limitations, we propose a knowledge-informed self-reflective PT framework powered by LLMs, called RefPentester, which is an AutoPT framework designed to assist human operators in identifying the current stage of the PT process, selecting appropriate tactic and technique for the stage, choosing suggested action, providing step-by-step operational guidance, and learning from previous failed operations. We also modeled the PT process as a seven-state Stage Machine to integrate the proposed framework effectively. The evaluation shows that RefPentester can successfully reveal credentials on Hack The Box's Sau machine, outperforming the baseline GPT-4o model by 16.7%. Across PT stages, RefPentester also demonstrates superior success rates on PT stage transitions.</p></details> |  |

This system intelligently distributes exploration budgets, optimizing for the long-term benefit of the recommendation platform.

Deploying these large-scale models on resource-constrained platforms presents significant challenges, with post-training fixed-point quantization often used as a model compression technique. However, quantization-only methods typically lead to significant accuracy degradation in LLMs when precision falls below 8 bits. This paper addresses this challenge through a software-hardware co-design framework, ITERA-LLM, which integrates sub-8-bit quantization with SVD-based iterative low-rank tensor decomposition for error compensation, leading to higher compression ratios and reduced computational complexity. The proposed approach is complemented by a hardware-aware Design Space Exploration (DSE) process that optimizes accuracy, latency, and resource utilization, tailoring the configuration to the specific requirements of the targeted LLM. Our results show that ITERA-LLM achieves linear layer latency reduction of up to 41.1%, compared to quantization-only baseline approach while maintaining similar model accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulating and Analysing Human Survey Responses with Large Language Models: A Case Study in Energy Stated Preference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10652v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survey research plays a crucial role in studies by capturing consumer preferences and informing policy decisions. Stated preference (SP) surveys help researchers understand how individuals make trade-offs in hypothetical, potentially futuristic, scenarios. However, traditional methods are costly, time-consuming, and affected by respondent fatigue and ethical constraints. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like responses, prompting interest in their use in survey research. This study investigates LLMs for simulating consumer choices in energy-related SP surveys and explores their integration into data collection and analysis workflows. Test scenarios were designed to assess the simulation performance of several LLMs (LLaMA 3.1, Mistral, GPT-3.5, DeepSeek-R1) at individual and aggregated levels, considering prompt design, in-context learning (ICL), chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, model types, integration with traditional choice models, and potential biases. While LLMs achieve accuracy above random guessing, performance remains insufficient for practical simulation use. Cloud-based LLMs do not consistently outperform smaller local models. DeepSeek-R1 achieves the highest average accuracy (77%) and outperforms non-reasoning LLMs in accuracy, factor identification, and choice distribution alignment. Previous SP choices are the most effective input; longer prompts with more factors reduce accuracy. Mixed logit models can support LLM prompt refinement. Reasoning LLMs show potential in data analysis by indicating factor significance, offering a qualitative complement to statistical models. Despite limitations, pre-trained LLMs offer scalability and require minimal historical data. Future work should refine prompts, further explore CoT reasoning, and investigate fine-tuning techniques.</p></details> |  |

These models are increasingly being utilized for a range of SE tasks, including requirements engineering and design, code analysis and generation, software maintenance, and quality assurance. As LLMs become more integral to SE, evaluating their effectiveness is crucial for understanding their potential in this field. In recent years, substantial efforts have been made to assess LLM performance in various SE tasks, resulting in the creation of several benchmarks tailored to this purpose. This paper offers a thorough review of 191 benchmarks, addressing three main aspects: what benchmarks are available, how benchmarks are constructed, and the future outlook for these benchmarks. We begin by examining SE tasks such as requirements engineering and design, coding assistant, software testing, AIOPs, software maintenance, and quality management. We then analyze the benchmarks and their development processes, highlighting the limitations of existing benchmarks. Additionally, we discuss the successes and failures of LLMs in different software tasks and explore future opportunities and challenges for SE-related benchmarks. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of benchmark research in SE and offer insights to support the creation of more effective evaluation tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimized Couplings for Watermarking Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08878v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-language models (LLMs) are now able to produce text that is, in many cases, seemingly indistinguishable from human-generated content. This has fueled the development of watermarks that imprint a ``signal'' in LLM-generated text with minimal perturbation of an LLM's output. This paper provides an analysis of text watermarking in a one-shot setting. Through the lens of hypothesis testing with side information, we formulate and analyze the fundamental trade-off between watermark detection power and distortion in generated textual quality. We argue that a key component in watermark design is generating a coupling between the side information shared with the watermark detector and a random partition of the LLM vocabulary. Our analysis identifies the optimal coupling and randomization strategy under the worst-case LLM next-token distribution that satisfies a min-entropy constraint. We provide a closed-form expression of the resulting detection rate under the proposed scheme and quantify the cost in a max-min sense. Finally, we provide an array of numerical results, comparing the proposed scheme with the theoretical optimum and existing schemes, in both synthetic data and LLM watermarking.

HealthBench consists of 5,000 multi-turn conversations between a model and an individual user or healthcare professional. Responses are evaluated using conversation-specific rubrics created by 262 physicians. Unlike previous multiple-choice or short-answer benchmarks, HealthBench enables realistic, open-ended evaluation through 48,562 unique rubric criteria spanning several health contexts (e.g., emergencies, transforming clinical data, global health) and behavioral dimensions (e.g., accuracy, instruction following, communication). HealthBench performance over the last two years reflects steady initial progress (compare GPT-3.5 Turbo's 16% to GPT-4o's 32%) and more rapid recent improvements (o3 scores 60%). Smaller models have especially improved: GPT-4.1 nano outperforms GPT-4o and is 25 times cheaper. We additionally release two HealthBench variations: HealthBench Consensus, which includes 34 particularly important dimensions of model behavior validated via physician consensus, and HealthBench Hard, where the current top score is 32%.

This paper represents the initial contribution of this initiative. While recent developments in mathematical LLMs have predominantly emphasized reasoning skills, as evidenced by benchmarks on elementary to undergraduate-level mathematical tasks, the creative capabilities of these models have received comparatively little attention, and evaluation datasets remain scarce. To address this gap, we propose an evaluation criteria for mathematical creativity and introduce DeepMath-Creative, a novel, high-quality benchmark comprising constructive problems across algebra, geometry, analysis, and other domains. We conduct a systematic evaluation of mainstream LLMs' creative problem-solving abilities using this dataset. Experimental results show that even under lenient scoring criteria -- emphasizing core solution components and disregarding minor inaccuracies, such as small logical gaps, incomplete justifications, or redundant explanations -- the best-performing model, O3 Mini, achieves merely 70% accuracy, primarily on basic undergraduate-level constructive tasks. Performance declines sharply on more complex problems, with models failing to provide substantive strategies for open problems. These findings suggest that, although current LLMs display a degree of constructive proficiency on familiar and lower-difficulty problems, such performance is likely attributable to the recombination of memorized patterns rather than authentic creative insight or novel synthesis.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Probability Consistency in Large Language Models: Theoretical Foundations Meet Empirical Discrepancies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08739v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can autoregressive large language models (LLMs) learn consistent probability distributions when trained on sequences in different token orders? We prove formally that for any well-defined probability distribution, sequence perplexity is invariant under any factorization, including forward, backward, or arbitrary permutations. This result establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for studying how LLMs learn from data and defines principled protocols for empirical evaluation. Applying these protocols, we show that prior studies examining ordering effects suffer from critical methodological flaws. We retrain GPT-2 models across forward, backward, and arbitrary permuted orders on scientific text. We find systematic deviations from theoretical invariance across all orderings with arbitrary permutations strongly deviating from both forward and backward models, which largely (but not completely) agreed with one another. Deviations were traceable to differences in self-attention, reflecting positional and locality biases in processing. Our theoretical and empirical results provide novel avenues for understanding positional biases in LLMs and suggest methods for detecting when LLMs' probability distributions are inconsistent and therefore untrustworthy.</p></details> |  |

Their comprehension and reasoning capabilities enable promising applications in autonomous driving scenarios. However, existing research typically focuses on front-view perspectives and partial objects within scenes, struggling to achieve comprehensive scene understanding. Meanwhile, existing LVLMs suffer from the lack of mapping relationship between 2D and 3D and insufficient integration of 3D object localization and instruction understanding. To tackle these limitations, we first introduce NuInteract, a large-scale dataset with over 1.5M multi-view image language pairs spanning dense scene captions and diverse interactive tasks. Furthermore, we propose DriveMonkey, a simple yet effective framework that seamlessly integrates LVLMs with a spatial processor using a series of learnable queries. The spatial processor, designed as a plug-and-play component, can be initialized with pre-trained 3D detectors to improve 3D perception.

Whereas LLMs are likely to also transform innovation processes in a collaborative work setting, it is unclear what trajectory this transformation will follow. Innovation in these contexts encompasses both capability innovation that explores new possibilities by acquiring new competencies in a project and iterative innovation that exploits existing foundations by enhancing established competencies and improving project quality. Whether LLMs affect these two aspects of collaborative work and to what extent is an open empirical question. Open-source development provides an ideal setting to examine LLM impacts on these innovation types, as its voluntary and open/collaborative nature of contributions provides the greatest opportunity for technological augmentation. We focus on open-source projects on GitHub by leveraging a natural experiment around the selective rollout of GitHub Copilot (a programming-focused LLM) in October 2021, where GitHub Copilot selectively supported programming languages like Python or Rust, but not R or Haskell. We observe a significant jump in overall contributions, suggesting that LLMs effectively augment collaborative innovation in an unguided setting. Interestingly, Copilot's launch increased iterative innovation focused on maintenance-related or feature-refining contributions significantly more than it did capability innovation through code-development or feature-introducing commits. This disparity was more pronounced after the model upgrade in June 2022 and was evident in active projects with extensive coding activity, suggesting that as both LLM capabilities and/or available contextual information improve, the gap between capability and iterative innovation may widen. We discuss practical and policy implications to incentivize high-value innovative solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>JEL C...</summary><p>JEL Classification: O31, C88, J24, O35, L86</p></details> |

Existing arbitrary style transfer methods are based on either small models or pre-trained large-scale models. The small model-based methods fail to generate high-quality stylized images, bringing artifacts and disharmonious patterns. The pre-trained large-scale model-based methods can generate high-quality stylized images but struggle to preserve the content structure and cost long inference time. To this end, we propose a new framework, called SPAST, to generate high-quality stylized images with less inference time. Specifically, we design a novel Local-global Window Size Stylization Module (LGWSSM)tofuse style features into content features. Besides, we introduce a novel style prior loss, which can dig out the style priors from a pre-trained large-scale model into the SPAST and motivate the SPAST to generate high-quality stylized images with short inference time.We conduct abundant experiments to verify that our proposed method can generate high-quality stylized images and less inference time compared with the SOTA arbitrary style transfer methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neural Networks</p></details> |

The scarcity of labeled data and domain gaps between synthetic and real-world images also pose notable challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, \textbf{BooSTer}, that leverages both vision foundation models and large-scale mixed image sources, including synthetic, real, and single-view images. First, to fully unleash the potential of large-scale single-view images, we design a data generation strategy combining monocular depth estimation and diffusion models to generate dense stereo matching data from single-view images. Second, to tackle sparse labels in real-world datasets, we transfer knowledge from monocular depth estimation models, using pseudo-mono depth labels and a dynamic scale- and shift-invariant loss for additional supervision. Furthermore, we incorporate vision foundation model as an encoder to extract robust and transferable features, boosting accuracy and generalization. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving significant improvements in accuracy over existing methods, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data and domain shifts.</p></details> |  |

However, despite the recent proliferation of pretrained models and synthetic datasets, the field still lacks a systematic understanding of the generalizability limits of these models across seismic data representing a variety of geologic, acquisition and processing settings. Distributional shifts between different data sources, limitations in fine-tuning strategies and labeled data accessibility, and inconsistent evaluation protocols all represent major roadblocks in the deployment of reliable and robust models in real-world exploration settings. In this paper, we present the first large-scale benchmarking study explicitly designed to provide answers and guidelines for domain shift strategies in seismic interpretation. Our benchmark encompasses over $200$ models trained and evaluated on three heterogeneous datasets (synthetic and real data) including FaultSeg3D, CRACKS, and Thebe. We systematically assess pretraining, fine-tuning, and joint training strategies under varying degrees of domain shift. Our analysis highlights the fragility of current fine-tuning practices, the emergence of catastrophic forgetting, and the challenges of interpreting performance in a systematic manner. We establish a robust experimental baseline to provide insights into the tradeoffs inherent to current fault delineation workflows, and shed light on directions for developing more generalizable, interpretable and effective machine learning models for seismic interpretation. The insights and analyses reported provide a set of guidelines on the deployment of fault delineation models within seismic interpretation workflows.</p></details> |  |

The result extends to Minimum Vertex Cover. Though fast and approximate distributed algorithms for such problems were already known for $H$-minor-free graphs, all of them have an approximation ratio depending on the size of $H$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a large non-trivial excluded minor leading to fast and constant-approximation distributed algorithms, where the ratio is independent of the size of $H$. A new key ingredient in the analysis of these distributed algorithms is the use of asymptotic dimension.</p></details> |  |

Multi-Agent Systems with Large Language Models Unmask Fake News](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08532v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In today's digital environment, the rapid propagation of fake news via social networks poses significant social challenges. Most existing detection methods either employ traditional classification models, which suffer from low interpretability and limited generalization capabilities, or craft specific prompts for large language models (LLMs) to produce explanations and results directly, failing to leverage LLMs' reasoning abilities fully. Inspired by the saying that "truth becomes clearer through debate," our study introduces a novel multi-agent system with LLMs named TruEDebate (TED) to enhance the interpretability and effectiveness of fake news detection. TED employs a rigorous debate process inspired by formal debate settings. Central to our approach are two innovative components: the DebateFlow Agents and the InsightFlow Agents. The DebateFlow Agents organize agents into two teams, where one supports and the other challenges the truth of the news. These agents engage in opening statements, cross-examination, rebuttal, and closing statements, simulating a rigorous debate process akin to human discourse analysis, allowing for a thorough evaluation of news content. Concurrently, the InsightFlow Agents consist of two specialized sub-agents: the Synthesis Agent and the Analysis Agent. The Synthesis Agent summarizes the debates and provides an overarching viewpoint, ensuring a coherent and comprehensive evaluation.

HPC code requires specialized optimizations for parallelism, memory efficiency, and architecture-specific considerations that general-purpose LLMs often overlook. We present MARCO (Multi-Agent Reactive Code Optimizer), a novel framework that enhances LLM-generated code for HPC through a specialized multi-agent architecture. MARCO employs separate agents for code generation and performance evaluation, connected by a feedback loop that progressively refines optimizations. A key innovation is MARCO's web-search component that retrieves real-time optimization techniques from recent conference proceedings and research publications, bridging the knowledge gap in pre-trained LLMs. Our extensive evaluation on the LeetCode 75 problem set demonstrates that MARCO achieves a 14.6% average runtime reduction compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet alone, while the integration of the web-search component yields a 30.9% performance improvement over the base MARCO system. These results highlight the potential of multi-agent systems to address the specialized requirements of high-performance code generation, offering a cost-effective alternative to domain-specific model fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Recently, direct preference optimization and its variants have shown considerable promise in aligning language models, eliminating the need for reward models and online sampling. Despite these benefits, these methods rely on explicit assumptions about the Bradley-Terry (BT) model, which makes them prone to overfitting and results in suboptimal performance, particularly on reasoning-heavy tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a principled preference fine-tuning algorithm called InfoPO, which effectively and efficiently aligns large language models using preference data. InfoPO eliminates the reliance on the BT model and prevents the likelihood of the chosen response from decreasing. Extensive experiments confirm that InfoPO consistently outperforms established baselines on widely used open benchmarks, particularly in reasoning tasks.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |

However, most existing zero-shot approaches rely on LLMs to directly generate absolute scores, which often diverge from human evaluations owing to model biases and inconsistent scoring. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-based Comparative Essay Scoring (LCES), a method that formulates AES as a pairwise comparison task. Specifically, we instruct LLMs to judge which of two essays is better, collect many such comparisons, and convert them into continuous scores. Considering that the number of possible comparisons grows quadratically with the number of essays, we improve scalability by employing RankNet to efficiently transform LLM preferences into scalar scores. Experiments using AES benchmark datasets show that LCES outperforms conventional zero-shot methods in accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, LCES is robust across different LLM backbones, highlighting its applicability to real-world zero-shot AES.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures |

Recently, various downstream tasks, such as chart question answering, chart2text, and fact-checking, have emerged. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise in tackling these tasks, but their evaluation is costly and time-consuming, limiting real-world deployment. While using LVLMs as judges to assess the chart comprehension capabilities of other LVLMs could streamline evaluation processes, challenges like proprietary datasets, restricted access to powerful models, and evaluation costs hinder their adoption in industrial settings. To this end, we present a comprehensive evaluation of 13 open-source LVLMs as judges for diverse chart comprehension and reasoning tasks. We design both pairwise and pointwise evaluation tasks covering criteria like factual correctness, informativeness, and relevancy. Additionally, we analyze LVLM judges based on format adherence, positional consistency, length bias, and instruction-following. We focus on cost-effective LVLMs (<10B parameters) suitable for both research and commercial use, following a standardized evaluation protocol and rubric to measure the LVLM judge's accuracy. Experimental results reveal notable variability: while some open LVLM judges achieve GPT-4-level evaluation performance (about 80% agreement with GPT-4 judgments), others struggle (below ~10% agreement). Our findings highlight that state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs can serve as cost-effective automatic evaluators for chart-related tasks, though biases such as positional preference and length bias persist.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized stance detection by introducing novel capabilities in contextual understanding, cross-domain generalization, and multimodal analysis. Despite these progressions, existing surveys often lack comprehensive coverage of approaches that specifically leverage LLMs for stance detection. To bridge this critical gap, our review article conducts a systematic analysis of stance detection, comprehensively examining recent advancements of LLMs transforming the field, including foundational concepts, methodologies, datasets, applications, and emerging challenges. We present a novel taxonomy for LLM-based stance detection approaches, structured along three key dimensions: 1) learning methods, including supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, and zero-shot; 2) data modalities, such as unimodal, multimodal, and hybrid; and 3) target relationships, encompassing in-target, cross-target, and multi-target scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation techniques and analyze benchmark datasets and performance trends, highlighting the strengths and limitations of different architectures. Key applications in misinformation detection, political analysis, public health monitoring, and social media moderation are discussed. Finally, we identify critical challenges such as implicit stance expression, cultural biases, and computational constraints, while outlining promising future directions, including explainable stance reasoning, low-resource adaptation, and real-time deployment frameworks. Our survey highlights emerging trends, open challenges, and future directions to guide researchers and practitioners in developing next-generation stance detection systems powered by large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategy-Augmented Planning for Large Language Models via Opponent Exploitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08459v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently modeling and exploiting opponents is a long-standing challenge in adversarial domains. Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive textual data have recently demonstrated outstanding performance in general tasks, introducing new research directions for opponent modeling. Some studies primarily focus on directly using LLMs to generate decisions based on the elaborate prompt context that incorporates opponent descriptions, while these approaches are limited to scenarios where LLMs possess adequate domain expertise. To address that, we introduce a two-stage Strategy-Augmented Planning (SAP) framework that significantly enhances the opponent exploitation capabilities of LLM-based agents by utilizing a critical component, the Strategy Evaluation Network (SEN). Specifically, in the offline stage, we construct an explicit strategy space and subsequently collect strategy-outcome pair data for training the SEN network. During the online phase, SAP dynamically recognizes the opponent's strategies and greedily exploits them by searching best response strategy on the well-trained SEN, finally translating strategy to a course of actions by carefully designed prompts. Experimental results show that SAP exhibits robust generalization capabilities, allowing it to perform effectively not only against previously encountered opponent strategies but also against novel, unseen strategies. In the MicroRTS environment, SAP achieves a 85.35\% performance improvement over baseline methods and matches the competitiveness of reinforcement learning approaches against state-of-the-art (SOTA) rule-based AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCNN 2025</p></details> |
| **[VCRBench: Exploring Long-form Causal Reasoning Capabilities of Large Video Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08455v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in video understanding, the capabilities of Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) to perform video-based causal reasoning remains underexplored, largely due to the absence of relevant and dedicated benchmarks for evaluating causal reasoning in visually grounded and goal-driven settings. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark named Video-based long-form Causal Reasoning (VCRBench). We create VCRBench using procedural videos of simple everyday activities, where the steps are deliberately shuffled with each clip capturing a key causal event, to test whether LVLMs can identify, reason about, and correctly sequence the events needed to accomplish a specific goal. Moreover, the benchmark is carefully designed to prevent LVLMs from exploiting linguistic shortcuts, as seen in multiple-choice or binary QA formats, while also avoiding the challenges associated with evaluating open-ended QA. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs on VCRBench suggests that these models struggle with video-based long-form causal reasoning, primarily due to their difficulty in modeling long-range causal dependencies directly from visual observations. As a simple step toward enabling such capabilities, we propose Recognition-Reasoning Decomposition (RRD), a modular approach that breaks video-based causal reasoning into two sub-tasks of video recognition and causal reasoning. Our experiments on VCRBench show that RRD significantly boosts accuracy on VCRBench, with gains of up to 25.2%. Finally, our thorough analysis reveals interesting insights, for instance, that LVLMs primarily rely on language knowledge for complex video-based long-form causal reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, organizing UAVs to form multi-hop networks in large-scale dynamic environments presents significant challenges, including limitations in algorithmic scalability and the vast exploration space required for coordinated decision-making. To address these issues, we propose MRLMN, a novel framework that integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and large language models (LLMs) to jointly optimize UAV agents toward achieving optimal networking performance. The framework incorporates a grouping strategy with reward decomposition to enhance algorithmic scalability and balance decision-making across UAVs. In addition, behavioral constraints are applied to selected key UAVs to improve the robustness of the network. Furthermore, the framework integrates LLM agents, leveraging knowledge distillation to transfer their high-level decision-making capabilities to MARL agents. This enhances both the efficiency of exploration and the overall training process. In the distillation module, a Hungarian algorithm-based matching scheme is applied to align the decision outputs of the LLM and MARL agents and define the distillation loss. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in network performance, including enhanced coverage and communication quality.</p></details> |  |

However, when it comes to human body forgery, there has been a persistent lack of datasets and detection methods, due to the later inception and complexity of human body generation methods. To mitigate this issue, we introduce TikTok-DeepFake (TT-DF), a novel large-scale diffusion-based dataset containing 6,120 forged videos with 1,378,857 synthetic frames, specifically tailored for body forgery detection. TT-DF offers a wide variety of forgery methods, involving multiple advanced human image animation models utilized for manipulation, two generative configurations based on the disentanglement of identity and pose information, as well as different compressed versions. The aim is to simulate any potential unseen forged data in the wild as comprehensively as possible, and we also furnish a benchmark on TT-DF. Additionally, we propose an adapted body forgery detection model, Temporal Optical Flow Network (TOF-Net), which exploits the spatiotemporal inconsistencies and optical flow distribution differences between natural data and forged data. Our experiments demonstrate that TOF-Net achieves favorable performance on TT-DF, outperforming current state-of-the-art extendable facial forgery detection models.

Existing methods often rely on dense training datasets or explicit geometric modeling, limiting their scalability to real-world tasks. Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offer new possibilities for integrating vision and language understanding, but their application to autonomous robotic grasping remains largely unexplored. We present ORACLE-Grasp, a zero-shot framework that leverages LMMs as semantic oracles to guide grasp selection without requiring additional training or human input. The system formulates grasp prediction as a structured, iterative decision process, using dual-prompt tool calling to first extract high-level object context and then select task-relevant grasp regions. By discretizing the image space and reasoning over candidate areas, ORACLE-Grasp mitigates the spatial imprecision common in LMMs and produces human-like, task-driven grasp suggestions. Early stopping and depth-based refinement steps further enhance efficiency and physical grasp reliability. Experiments demonstrate that the predicted grasps achieve low positional and orientation errors relative to human-annotated ground truth and lead to high success rates in real-world pick up tasks. These results highlight the potential of combining language-driven reasoning with lightweight vision techniques to enable robust, autonomous grasping without task-specific datasets or retraining.</p></details> |  |

However, a benchmark for systematically evaluating their capabilities in this domain is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we propose CHOICE, an extensive benchmark designed to objectively evaluate the hierarchical remote sensing capabilities of VLMs. Focusing on 2 primary capability dimensions essential to remote sensing: perception and reasoning, we further categorize 6 secondary dimensions and 23 leaf tasks to ensure a well-rounded assessment coverage. CHOICE guarantees the quality of all 10,507 problems through a rigorous process of data collection from 50 globally distributed cities, question construction and quality control. The newly curated data and the format of multiple-choice questions with definitive answers allow for an objective and straightforward performance assessment. Our evaluation of 3 proprietary and 21 open-source VLMs highlights their critical limitations within this specialized context. We hope that CHOICE will serve as a valuable resource and offer deeper insights into the challenges and potential of VLMs in the field of remote sensing. We will release CHOICE at https://github.com/ShawnAn-WHU/CHOICE.</p></details> | 32 pages, 15 figures |

To address this, we construct a large-scale, difficulty-graded reasoning dataset containing approximately 3.34 million unique queries of varying difficulty levels and about 40 million distilled responses generated by multiple models over several passes. Leveraging pass rate and Coefficient of Variation (CV), we precisely select the most valuable training data to enhance reasoning capability. Notably, we observe a training pattern shift, indicating that reasoning-focused training based on base models requires higher learning rates for effective training. Using this carefully selected data, we significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of the base model, achieving a pass rate of 79.2\% on the AIME2024 mathematical reasoning benchmark. This result surpasses most current distilled models and closely approaches state-of-the-art performance. We provide detailed descriptions of our data processing, difficulty assessment, and training methodology, and have publicly released all datasets and methods to promote rapid progress in open-source long-reasoning LLMs. The dataset is available at: \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/a-m-team/AM-DeepSeek-Distilled-40M}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/a-m-team/AM-DeepSeek-Distilled-40M}</p></details> |  |

However, hour-long video understanding, spanning over one hour and containing tens of thousands of visual frames, remains under-explored because of 1) challenging long-term video analyses, 2) inefficient large-model approaches, and 3) lack of large-scale benchmark datasets.

Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K.

The tDRO parameterizes the domain weights and updates them with scaled domain gradients. The optimized weights are then transferred to the LLM-DR fine-tuning to train more robust retrievers. Experiments show optimal improvements in large-scale retrieval benchmarks and reduce up to 30% dataset usage after applying our optimization algorithm with a series of different-sized LLM-DR models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI25.

We focus on Vietnamese, with fewer challenging MCQA datasets than in English. The two existing datasets, ViMMRC 1.0 and ViMMRC 2.0, focus on literature. Recent research in Vietnamese natural language processing (NLP) has focused on the Vietnamese National High School Graduation Examination (VNHSGE) from 2019 to 2023 to evaluate ChatGPT. However, these studies have mainly focused on how ChatGPT solves the VNHSGE step by step. We aim to create a novel and high-quality dataset by providing structured guidelines for typing LaTeX formulas for mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. This dataset can be used to evaluate the MCSB ability of LLMs and smaller language models (LMs) because it is typed in a strict LaTeX style. We focus on predicting the character (A, B, C, or D) that is the most likely answer to a question, given the context of the question. Our evaluation of six well-known LLMs, namely BLOOMZ-7.1B-MT, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-2-70B, GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.0, on the ViMMRC 1.0 and ViMMRC 2.0 benchmarks and our proposed dataset shows promising results on the MCSB ability of LLMs for Vietnamese.

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in FLLM, examining challenges from four critical perspectives: feasibility, robustness, security, and future directions. We present an exhaustive survey of existing studies on FLLM feasibility, introduce methods to enhance robustness in the face of resource, data, and task heterogeneity, and analyze novel risks associated with this integration, including privacy threats and security challenges. We also review the latest developments in defense mechanisms and explore promising future research directions, such as few-shot learning, machine unlearning, and IP protection. This survey highlights the pressing need for further research to enhance system robustness and security while addressing the unique challenges posed by the integration of FL and LLM.</p></details> | 35 pages |
| **[Enhancing User Interest based on Stream Clustering and Memory Networks in Large-Scale Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13238v6)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender Systems (RSs) provide personalized recommendation service based on user interest, which are widely used in various platforms. However, there are lots of users with sparse interest due to lacking consumption behaviors, which leads to poor recommendation results for them. This problem is widespread in large-scale RSs and is particularly difficult to address. To solve this challenging problem, we propose an innovative solution called User Interest Enhancement (UIE). UIE enhances user interest including user profile and user history behavior sequences by leveraging the enhancement vectors and personalized enhancement vectors generated based on dynamic streaming clustering of similar users and items from multiple perspectives, which are stored and updated in memory networks. UIE not only remarkably improves model performance for users with sparse interest, but also delivers notable gains for other users. As an end-to-end solution, UIE is easy to implement on top of existing ranking models. Furthermore, we extend our approach to long-tail items using similar methods, which also yields excellent improvements. We conduct extensive offline and online experiments in an industrial RS. The results demonstrate that UIE substantially outperforms other existing approaches, especially for users with sparse interest. UIE has been deployed in several large-scale RSs at Tencent since 2022, which was made public on 21 May 2024. In addition, UIE-based methods have also been successfully applied in candidate generation, pre-ranking, and context-DNN stages. Multiple teams have developed solutions based on UIE, focusing on updating clustering algorithms and attention mechanisms. As far as we know, UIE has been applied in multiple RSs, advertising systems and search engines. The thoughts of UIE, dynamic streaming clustering and similarity enhancement, have inspired subsequent relevant works.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Shapley Value-based Non-Uniform Pruning of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01731v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pruning large language models (LLMs) is a promising solution for reducing model sizes and computational complexity while preserving performance. Traditional layer-wise pruning methods often adopt a uniform sparsity approach across all layers, which leads to suboptimal performance due to the varying significance of individual transformer layers within the model not being accounted for. To this end, we propose the Shapley Value-based Non-Uniform Pruning (SV-NUP) method for LLMs. This approach quantifies the contribution of each transformer layer to the overall model performance, enabling the assignment of tailored pruning budgets to different layers to retain critical parameters. To further improve efficiency, we design the Sliding Window-based Shapley Value approximation method. It substantially reduces computational overhead compared to exact SV calculation methods. Extensive experiments on various LLMs including LLaMA-v1, LLaMA-v2 and OPT demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results reveal that non-uniform pruning significantly enhances the performance of pruned models. Notably, SV-NUP achieves a reduction in perplexity (PPL) of 18.01% and 19.55% on LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B, respectively, compared to SparseGPT at 70% sparsity.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods for assessing these environments, including field surveys and geographic information systems (GIS), are resource-intensive and challenging to evaluate neighborhood environments at scale. Although machine learning offers potential for automated analysis, the laborious process of labeling training data and the lack of accessible models hinder scalability. This study explores the feasibility of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini as tools for decoding neighborhood environments (e.g., sidewalk and powerline) at scale. We train a robust YOLOv11-based model, which achieves an average accuracy of 99.13% in detecting six environmental indicators, including streetlight, sidewalk, powerline, apartment, single-lane road, and multilane road. We then evaluate four LLMs, including ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Grok, to assess their feasibility, robustness, and limitations in identifying these indicators, with a focus on the impact of prompting strategies and fine-tuning. We apply majority voting with the top three LLMs to achieve over 88% accuracy, which demonstrates LLMs could be a useful tool to decode the neighborhood environment without any training effort.</p></details> | 8 pages |

While deep learning-enhanced Cognitive Radio Technology (CRT) provides promising solutions for tasks such as radio signal classification (RSC), denoising, and spectrum allocation, existing DL-based CRT frameworks are typically task-specific and lack scalability in diverse real-world applications. This limitation naturally leads to the exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs), whose exceptional cross-domain generalization capabilities offer new potential for advancing CRT. To bridge this gap, we propose RadioLLM, a novel framework that integrates Hybrid Prompt and Token Reprogramming (HPTR) for combining radio signal features with expert knowledge, and a Frequency-Attuned Fusion (FAF) module for enhanced high-frequency feature modeling. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that RadioLLM achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines in the majority of testing scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE JSAC for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[A Large-Scale Empirical Analysis of Custom GPTs' Vulnerabilities in the OpenAI Ecosystem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08148v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Millions of users leverage generative pretrained transformer (GPT)-based language models developed by leading model providers for a wide range of tasks. To support enhanced user interaction and customization, many platforms-such as OpenAI-now enable developers to create and publish tailored model instances, known as custom GPTs, via dedicated repositories or application stores. These custom GPTs empower users to browse and interact with specialized applications designed to meet specific needs. However, as custom GPTs see growing adoption, concerns regarding their security vulnerabilities have intensified. Existing research on these vulnerabilities remains largely theoretical, often lacking empirical, large-scale, and statistically rigorous assessments of associated risks. In this study, we analyze 14,904 custom GPTs to assess their susceptibility to seven exploitable threats, such as roleplay-based attacks, system prompt leakage, phishing content generation, and malicious code synthesis, across various categories and popularity tiers within the OpenAI marketplace. We introduce a multi-metric ranking system to examine the relationship between a custom GPT's popularity and its associated security risks. Our findings reveal that over 95% of custom GPTs lack adequate security protections. The most prevalent vulnerabilities include roleplay-based vulnerabilities (96.51%), system prompt leakage (92.20%), and phishing (91.22%). Furthermore, we demonstrate that OpenAI's foundational models exhibit inherent security weaknesses, which are often inherited or amplified in custom GPTs. These results highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures and stricter content moderation to ensure the safe deployment of GPT-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Computer-Aided Design: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08137v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen rapid advancements in recent years, with models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, showcasing their remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While substantial research has been conducted on LLMs in various fields, a comprehensive review focusing on their integration with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) remains notably absent. CAD is the industry standard for 3D modeling and plays a vital role in the design and development of products across different industries. As the complexity of modern designs increases, the potential for LLMs to enhance and streamline CAD workflows presents an exciting frontier. This article presents the first systematic survey exploring the intersection of LLMs and CAD. We begin by outlining the industrial significance of CAD, highlighting the need for AI-driven innovation. Next, we provide a detailed overview of the foundation of LLMs. We also examine both closed-source LLMs as well as publicly available models. The core of this review focuses on the various applications of LLMs in CAD, providing a taxonomy of six key areas where these models are making considerable impact. Finally, we propose several promising future directions for further advancements, which offer vast opportunities for innovation and are poised to shape the future of CAD technology.

| **[Discriminative Finetuning of Generative Large Language Models without Reward Models and Human Preference Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18679v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become a crucial step for aligning pretrained large language models (LLMs) using supervised datasets of input-output pairs. However, despite being supervised, SFT is inherently limited by its generative training objective. To address its limitations, the existing common strategy is to follow SFT with a separate phase of preference optimization (PO), which relies on either human-labeled preference data or a strong reward model to guide the learning process. In this paper, we address the limitations of SFT by exploring one of the most successful techniques in conventional supervised learning: discriminative learning. We introduce Discriminative Fine-Tuning (DFT), an improved variant of SFT, which mitigates the burden of collecting human-labeled preference data or training strong reward models. Unlike SFT that employs a generative approach and overlooks negative data, DFT adopts a discriminative paradigm that increases the probability of positive answers while suppressing potentially negative ones, aiming for data prediction instead of token prediction. Our contributions include: (i) a discriminative probabilistic framework for fine-tuning LLMs by explicitly modeling the discriminative likelihood of an answer among all possible outputs given an input; (ii) efficient algorithms to optimize this discriminative likelihood; and (iii) extensive experiments demonstrating DFT's effectiveness, achieving performance better than SFT and comparable to if not better than SFT$\rightarrow$PO.

Significant view changes, such as air-to-ground with very sparse view overlap, pose an even greater challenge to the correspondence solvers. We present a novel optimization-based approach that significantly enhances existing feature matching methods by introducing geometry cues in addition to color cues. This helps fill gaps when there is less overlap in large-scale scenarios. Our method formulates geometric verification as an optimization problem, guiding feature matching within detector-free methods and using sparse correspondences from detector-based methods as anchor points. By enforcing geometric constraints via the Sampson Distance, our approach ensures that the denser correspondences from detector-free methods are geometrically consistent and more accurate. This hybrid strategy significantly improves correspondence density and accuracy, mitigates multi-view inconsistencies, and leads to notable advancements in camera pose accuracy and point cloud density. It outperforms state-of-the-art feature matching methods on benchmark datasets and enables feature matching in challenging extreme large-scale settings.</p></details> |  |

Although Arabic is considered one of the most widely spoken languages across 27 countries in the Arabic world and used as a second language in some other non-Arabic countries as well, there is still a scarcity of Arabic resources, datasets, and tools. Arabic NLP tasks face various challenges due to the complexities of the Arabic language, including its rich morphology, intricate structure, and diverse writing standards, among other factors. Researchers have been actively addressing these challenges, demonstrating that pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on multilingual corpora achieve significant success in various Arabic NLP tasks. This study provides an overview of using large language models (LLMs) for the Arabic language, highlighting early pre-trained Arabic Language models across various NLP applications and their ability to handle diverse Arabic content tasks and dialects. It also provides an overview of how techniques like finetuning and prompt engineering can enhance the performance of these models. Additionally, the study summarizes common Arabic benchmarks and datasets while presenting our observations on the persistent upward trend in the adoption of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Origi...</summary><p>Original language: English This paper has been submitted to the First International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Generative AI (FICAILY 2025), and it has been accepted for presentation at FICAILY on 9-10/July 2025 and for publication in the Springer Nature.

However, generating SVAs has traditionally been a manual, labor-intensive, and error-prone process. Recent advances in automatic assertion generation, particularly those using machine learning and large language models (LLMs), have shown promising potential, though most approaches remain in the early stages of development. In this work, we introduce Spec2Assertion, a new technique for automatically generating assertions from design specifications prior to RTL implementation. It leverages LLMs with progressive regularization and incorporates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to guide assertion synthesis. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation methodology that assesses assertion quality across a broad range of scenarios. Experiments on multiple benchmark designs show that Spec2Assertion generates 70% more syntax-correct assertions with 2X quality improvement on average compared to a recent state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

This can lead to outdated or contradictory treatment suggestions. This study investigated how LLMs respond to evolving clinical guidelines, focusing on concept drift and internal inconsistencies. We developed the DriftMedQA benchmark to simulate guideline evolution and assessed the temporal reliability of various LLMs. Our evaluation of seven state-of-the-art models across 4,290 scenarios demonstrated difficulties in rejecting outdated recommendations and frequently endorsing conflicting guidance. Additionally, we explored two mitigation strategies: Retrieval-Augmented Generation and preference fine-tuning via Direct Preference Optimization. While each method improved model performance, their combination led to the most consistent and reliable results. These findings underscore the need to improve LLM robustness to temporal shifts to ensure more dependable applications in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Laws of Large Numbers for Information Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07958v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Laws of large numbers establish asymptotic guarantees for recovering features of a probability distribution using independent samples. We introduce a framework for proving analogous results for recovery of the $\sigma$-field of a probability space, interpreted as information resolution--the granularity of measurable events given by comparison to our samples. Our main results show that, under iid sampling, the Borel $\sigma$-field in $\mathbb R^d$ and in more general metric spaces can be recovered in the strongest possible mode of convergence. We also derive finite-sample $L^1$ bounds for uniform convergence of $\sigma$-fields on $[0,1]^d$. We illustrate the use of our framework with two applications: constructing randomized solutions to the Skorokhod embedding problem, and analyzing the loss of variants of random forests for regression.</p></details> | 23 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Symbolic Regression with Multimodal Large Language Models and Kolmogorov Arnold Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07956v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel approach to symbolic regression using vision-capable large language models (LLMs) and the ideas behind Google DeepMind's Funsearch. The LLM is given a plot of a univariate function and tasked with proposing an ansatz for that function. The free parameters of the ansatz are fitted using standard numerical optimisers, and a collection of such ans\"atze make up the population of a genetic algorithm. Unlike other symbolic regression techniques, our method does not require the specification of a set of functions to be used in regression, but with appropriate prompt engineering, we can arbitrarily condition the generative step. By using Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), we demonstrate that ``univariate is all you need'' for symbolic regression, and extend this method to multivariate functions by learning the univariate function on each edge of a trained KAN. The combined expression is then simplified by further processing with a language model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Stragglers in Large Model Training Using What-if Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05713v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) training is one of the most demanding distributed computations today, often requiring thousands of GPUs with frequent synchronization across machines. Such a workload pattern makes it susceptible to stragglers, where the training can be stalled by few slow workers. At ByteDance we find stragglers are not trivially always caused by hardware failures, but can arise from multiple complex factors. This work aims to present a comprehensive study on the straggler issues in LLM training, using a five-month trace collected from our ByteDance LLM training cluster. The core methodology is what-if analysis that simulates the scenario without any stragglers and contrasts with the actual case. We use this method to study the following questions: (1) how often do stragglers affect training jobs, and what effect do they have on job performance; (2) do stragglers exhibit temporal or spatial patterns; and (3) what are the potential root causes for stragglers?</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Dynamics in Continual Pre-Training for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07796v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Pre-Training (CPT) has become a popular and effective method to apply strong foundation models to specific downstream tasks. In this work, we explore the learning dynamics throughout the CPT process for large language models. We specifically focus on how general and downstream domain performance evolves at each training step, with domain performance measured via validation losses. We have observed that the CPT loss curve fundamentally characterizes the transition from one curve to another hidden curve, and could be described by decoupling the effects of distribution shift and learning rate annealing. We derive a CPT scaling law that combines the two factors, enabling the prediction of loss at any (continual) training steps and across learning rate schedules (LRS) in CPT. Our formulation presents a comprehensive understanding of several critical factors in CPT, including loss potential, peak learning rate, training steps, replay ratio, etc. Moreover, our approach can be adapted to customize training hyper-parameters to different CPT goals such as balancing general and domain-specific performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scaling law holds across various CPT datasets and training hyper-parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML2025 (spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[Assessing the Chemical Intelligence of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07735v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models are versatile, general-purpose tools with a wide range of applications. Recently, the advent of "reasoning models" has led to substantial improvements in their abilities in advanced problem-solving domains such as mathematics and software engineering. In this work, we assessed the ability of reasoning models to directly perform chemistry tasks, without any assistance from external tools. We created a novel benchmark, called ChemIQ, which consists of 796 questions assessing core concepts in organic chemistry, focused on molecular comprehension and chemical reasoning. Unlike previous benchmarks, which primarily use multiple choice formats, our approach requires models to construct short-answer responses, more closely reflecting real-world applications. The reasoning models, exemplified by OpenAI's o3-mini, correctly answered 28%-59% of questions depending on the reasoning level used, with higher reasoning levels significantly increasing performance on all tasks. These models substantially outperformed the non-reasoning model, GPT-4o, which achieved only 7% accuracy. We found that Large Language Models can now convert SMILES strings to IUPAC names, a task earlier models were unable to perform. Additionally, we show that the latest reasoning models can elucidate structures from 1H and 13C NMR data, correctly generating SMILES strings for 74% of molecules containing up to 10 heavy atoms, and in one case solving a structure comprising 21 heavy atoms. For each task, we found evidence that the reasoning process mirrors that of a human chemist. Our results demonstrate that the latest reasoning models have the ability to perform advanced chemical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[The First Prompt Counts the Most! An Evaluation of Large Language Models on Iterative Example-Based Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06774v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation have been extensively studied, particularly for implementing target functionalities from natural-language descriptions. Alternatively, input-output (I/O) examples provide an accessible, unambiguous, and flexible way to describe functionalities. However, their inherent diversity, opaqueness, and incompleteness impose greater challenges for understanding and implementing the target requirements. Therefore, generating code from I/O examples (i.e., example-based code generation) provides a new perspective, allowing us to additionally evaluate LLMs' capability to infer target functionalities from limited information and to process new-form requirements. However, related research about LLMs in example-based code generation remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive study on example-based code generation using LLMs. We adopt an iterative evaluation framework and formalize the objective of example-based code generation as two sequential sub-objectives: generating code conforming to the given examples and generating code that successfully implements the target functionalities from (iteratively) given examples. We assess six state-of-the-art LLMs using a new benchmark of 172 diverse target functionalities. The results demonstrate that when requirements are described using iterative I/O examples rather than natural language, the LLMs' score decreases by over 60%, and the vast majority (even over 95%) of successfully implemented functionalities are achieved in the first round of the iterations. Furthermore, we also find that combining I/O examples with even imprecise and fragmental natural language descriptions greatly improves LLM performance, and the selection of initial I/O examples can also influence the score, suggesting opportunities for prompt optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISSTA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Circuit Partitioning Using Large Language Models for Quantum Compilation and Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07711v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We are in the midst of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, where quantum computers are limited by noisy gates, some of which are more error-prone than others and can render the final computation incomprehensible. Quantum circuit compilation algorithms attempt to minimize these noisy gates when mapping quantum algorithms onto quantum hardware but face computational challenges that restrict their application to circuits with no more than 5-6 qubits, necessitating the need to partition large circuits before the application of noisy quantum gate minimization algorithms. The existing generation of these algorithms is heuristic in nature and does not account for downstream gate minimization tasks. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to change this and help improve quantum circuit partitions. This paper investigates the use of LLMs, such as Llama and Mistral, for partitioning quantum circuits by capitalizing on their abilities to understand and generate code, including QASM. Specifically, we teach LLMs to partition circuits using the quick partition approach of the Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit. Through experimental evaluations, we show that careful fine-tuning of open source LLMs enables us to obtain an accuracy of 53.4% for the partition task while over-the-shelf LLMs are unable to correctly partition circuits, using standard 1-shot and few-shot training approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 tables and 3 figures</p></details> |

We analyze two aspects of post-alignment distributional shift of LLM responses. First, we re-examine previously reported reductions in response diversity post-alignment. Our analysis suggests that an apparent drop in the diversity of responses is largely explained by quality control and information aggregation. Alignment suppresses irrelevant and unhelpful content while shifting the output distribution toward longer responses that cover information spanning several responses from the base LLM, essentially presenting diverse information in a single response. Finding little evidence that alignment suppresses useful information, it is natural to ask the opposite question: do aligned models surface information that cannot be recovered from base models? Our second investigation shows this is not the case and the behavior of aligned models is recoverable from base models without fine-tuning. A combination of in-context examples and lower-resolution semantic hints about response content can elicit responses from base LLMs that are as similar to alignment-tuned LLM responses as alignment-tuned LLM responses are to each other. Taken together, these results indicate that current alignment techniques capture but do not extend the useful subset of assistant-like base LLM behavior, providing further evidence for the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis. They also show that in-context alignment can go surprisingly far as a strategy for imitating aligned LLMs without fine-tuning.

While numerous benchmarks assess their intelligence, limited attention has been given to their ability to explore--an essential capacity for discovering new information and adapting to novel environments in both natural and artificial systems. The extent to which LLMs can effectively explore, particularly in open-ended tasks, remains unclear. This study investigates whether LLMs can surpass humans in exploration during an open-ended task, using Little Alchemy 2 as a paradigm, where agents combine elements to discover new ones. Results show most LLMs underperform compared to humans, except for the o1 model, with traditional LLMs relying primarily on uncertainty-driven strategies, unlike humans who balance uncertainty and empowerment. Results indicate that traditional reasoning-focused LLMs, such as GPT-4o, exhibit a significantly faster and less detailed reasoning process, limiting their exploratory performance. In contrast, the DeepSeek reasoning model demonstrates prolonged, iterative thought processes marked by repetitive analysis of combinations and past trials, reflecting a more thorough and human-like exploration strategy. Representational analysis of the models with Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) revealed that uncertainty and choices are represented at earlier transformer blocks, while empowerment values are processed later, causing LLMs to think too fast and make premature decisions, hindering effective exploration. These findings shed light on the limitations of LLM exploration and suggest directions for improving their adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 16 figures, under review</p></details> |

However, in large-scale cloud environments, the diverse and dynamic nature of workloads poses significant challenges for multi-tenant NoSQL databases. Based on our practical observations, we have identified three crucial challenges: (1) the impact of caching on performance isolation, as cache hits alter request execution and resource consumption, leading to inaccurate traffic control; (2) the dynamic changes in traffic, with changes in tenant traffic trends causing throttling or resource wastage, and changes in access distribution causing hot key pressure or cache hit ratio drops; and (3) the imbalanced layout of data nodes due to tenants' diverse resource requirements, leading to low resource utilization. To address these challenges, we introduce ABase, a multi-tenant NoSQL serverless database developed at ByteDance. ABase introduces a two-layer caching mechanism with a cache-aware isolation mechanism to ensure accurate resource consumption estimates. Furthermore, ABase employs a predictive autoscaling policy to dynamically adjust resources in response to tenant traffic changes and a multi-resource rescheduling algorithm to balance resource utilization across data nodes. With these innovations, ABase has successfully served ByteDance's large-scale cloud environment, supporting a total workload that has achieved a peak QPS of over 13 billion and total storage exceeding 1 EB.</p></details> | SIGMOD 2025 accepted |

While deep learning has greatly advanced segmentation in clinical settings, there is limited work on pre-clinical imaging, notably in porcine models, which are often used due to their anatomical and physiological similarity to humans. However, differences between species create a domain shift that complicates direct model transfer from human to pig data. Recently, foundation models trained on large human datasets have shown promise for robust medical image segmentation; yet their applicability to porcine data remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate whether foundation models can generate sufficiently accurate pseudo-labels for pig cardiac CT and propose a simple self-training approach to iteratively refine these labels. Our method requires no manually annotated pig data, relying instead on iterative updates to improve segmentation quality. We demonstrate that this self-training process not only enhances segmentation accuracy but also smooths out temporal inconsistencies across consecutive frames. Although our results are encouraging, there remains room for improvement, for example by incorporating more sophisticated self-training strategies and by exploring additional foundation models and other cardiac imaging technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at FIMH 2025</p></details> |

This emerging approach positions itself as a competitive alternative to traditional gradient-boosted tree methods. However, while biases in conventional machine learning models are well documented, it remains unclear how these biases manifest in tabular ICL. The paper investigates the fairness implications of tabular ICL and explores three preprocessing strategies--correlation removal, group-balanced demonstration selection, and uncertainty-based demonstration selection--to address bias. Comprehensive experiments indicate that uncertainty-based demonstration selection consistently enhances group fairness of in-context predictions. The source code for reproducing the results of this work can be found at https://github.com/patrikken/Fair-TabICL.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, existing FM-enabled robots primary operate in closed-world settings, where the robot is given a full prior map or has a full view of its workspace. This paper addresses the deployment of FM-enabled robots in the field, where missions often require a robot to operate in large-scale and unstructured environments. To effectively accomplish these missions, robots must actively explore their environments, navigate obstacle-cluttered terrain, handle unexpected sensor inputs, and operate with compute constraints. We discuss recent deployments of SPINE, our LLM-enabled autonomy framework, in field robotic settings. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first demonstration of large-scale LLM-enabled robot planning in unstructured environments with several kilometers of missions. SPINE is agnostic to a particular LLM, which allows us to distill small language models capable of running onboard size, weight and power (SWaP) limited platforms. Via preliminary model distillation work, we then present the first language-driven UAV planner using on-device language models. We conclude our paper by proposing several promising directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE ICRA Workshop on Field Robotics 2025</p></details> |

Despite extensive studies on scaling behaviors for general-purpose tasks, medical images exhibit substantial differences from natural data. It remains unclear the key factors in developing medical vision foundation models at scale due to the absence of an extensive understanding of scaling behavior in the medical domain. In this paper, we explored the scaling behavior across model sizes, training algorithms, data sizes, and imaging modalities in developing scalable medical vision foundation models by self-supervised learning. To support scalable pretraining, we introduce BioVFM-21M, a large-scale biomedical image dataset encompassing a wide range of biomedical image modalities and anatomies. We observed that scaling up does provide benefits but varies across tasks. Additional analysis reveals several factors correlated with scaling benefits. Finally, we propose BioVFM, a large-scale medical vision foundation model pretrained on 21 million biomedical images, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation models across 12 medical benchmarks. Our results highlight that while scaling up is beneficial for pursuing better performance, task characteristics, data diversity, pretraining methods, and computational efficiency remain critical considerations for developing scalable medical foundation models.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[A Multi-Task Foundation Model for Wireless Channel Representation Using Contrastive and Masked Autoencoder Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09160v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current applications of self-supervised learning to wireless channel representation often borrow paradigms developed for text and image processing, without fully addressing the unique characteristics and constraints of wireless communications. Aiming to fill this gap, we first propose WiMAE (Wireless Masked Autoencoder), a transformer-based encoder-decoder foundation model pretrained on a realistic open-source multi-antenna wireless channel dataset. Building upon this foundation, we develop ContraWiMAE, which enhances WiMAE by incorporating a contrastive learning objective alongside the reconstruction task in a unified multi-task framework. By warm-starting from pretrained WiMAE weights and generating positive pairs via noise injection, the contrastive component enables the model to capture both structural and discriminative features, enhancing representation quality beyond what reconstruction alone can achieve. Through extensive evaluation on unseen scenarios, we demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches across multiple downstream tasks, with ContraWiMAE showing further improvements in linear separability and adaptability in diverse wireless environments. Comparative evaluations against a state-of-the-art wireless channel foundation model confirm the superior performance and data efficiency of our models, highlighting their potential as powerful baselines for future research in self-supervised wireless channel representation learning.</p></details> |  |

However, a detailed understanding of the forest floor remains a challenge due to high natural variability, quickly changing environmental parameters, and ambiguous annotations due to unclear definitions. To address this issue, we adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a vision foundation model with strong generalization capabilities, to segment forest floor objects such as tree stumps, vegetation, and woody debris. To this end, we employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to fine-tune a small subset of additional model parameters while keeping the original weights fixed. We adjust SAM's mask decoder to generate masks corresponding to our dataset categories, allowing for automatic segmentation without manual prompting. Our results show that the adapter-based PEFT method achieves the highest mean intersection over union (mIoU), while Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA), with fewer parameters, offers a lightweight alternative for resource-constrained UAV platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Novel Approaches for Precision Agriculture and Forestry with Autonomous Robots IEEE ICRA Workshop - 2025</p></details> |
| **[Probability Consistency in Large Language Models: Theoretical Foundations Meet Empirical Discrepancies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08739v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can autoregressive large language models (LLMs) learn consistent probability distributions when trained on sequences in different token orders? We prove formally that for any well-defined probability distribution, sequence perplexity is invariant under any factorization, including forward, backward, or arbitrary permutations. This result establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for studying how LLMs learn from data and defines principled protocols for empirical evaluation. Applying these protocols, we show that prior studies examining ordering effects suffer from critical methodological flaws. We retrain GPT-2 models across forward, backward, and arbitrary permuted orders on scientific text. We find systematic deviations from theoretical invariance across all orderings with arbitrary permutations strongly deviating from both forward and backward models, which largely (but not completely) agreed with one another. Deviations were traceable to differences in self-attention, reflecting positional and locality biases in processing. Our theoretical and empirical results provide novel avenues for understanding positional biases in LLMs and suggest methods for detecting when LLMs' probability distributions are inconsistent and therefore untrustworthy.</p></details> |  |

To address limitations in existing next-token prediction approaches-namely resolution loss from VQ-VAE tokenization and lack of conditional generation-we propose three key innovations: (i) separate vocabularies for discrete spatial features and continuous variates, combined via Causal Multi-Head Cross-Attention (CMHCA), (ii) continuous kinematic conditioning through prepended context embeddings, and (iii) scalable and simple, high-resolution continuous variate tokenization without joint vocabulary inflation. Our model enables fast, high-fidelity generation of pixel and time sequences for Cherenkov photons, validated through closure tests in the High Performance DIRC. We also show our model generalizes to reconstruction tasks such as pion and kaon identification, in which we show its ability to leverage fine-tuning.</p></details> | 19 pages; 14 figures |
| **[TiMo: Spatiotemporal Foundation Model for Satellite Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08723v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite image time series (SITS) provide continuous observations of the Earth's surface, making them essential for applications such as environmental management and disaster assessment. However, existing spatiotemporal foundation models rely on plain vision transformers, which encode entire temporal sequences without explicitly capturing multiscale spatiotemporal relationships between land objects. This limitation hinders their effectiveness in downstream tasks. To overcome this challenge, we propose TiMo, a novel hierarchical vision transformer foundation model tailored for SITS analysis. At its core, we introduce a spatiotemporal gyroscope attention mechanism that dynamically captures evolving multiscale patterns across both time and space. For pre-training, we curate MillionST, a large-scale dataset of one million images from 100,000 geographic locations, each captured across 10 temporal phases over five years, encompassing diverse geospatial changes and seasonal variations. Leveraging this dataset, we adapt masked image modeling to pre-train TiMo, enabling it to effectively learn and encode generalizable spatiotemporal representations.Extensive experiments across multiple spatiotemporal tasks-including deforestation monitoring, land cover segmentation, crop type classification, and flood detection-demonstrate TiMo's superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Code, model, and dataset will be released at https://github.com/MiliLab/TiMo.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent heterogenity of cancer and high cost of data generation make accurate prediction challenging. In this study, we investigate whether incorporating the pretrained foundation model scGPT can enhance the performance of existing drug response prediction frameworks. Our approach builds on the DeepCDR framework, which encodes drug representations from graph structures and cell representations from multi-omics profiles. We adapt this framework by leveraging scGPT to generate enriched cell representations using its pretrained knowledge to compensate for limited amount of data. We evaluate our modified framework using IC$_{50}$ values on Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and a leave-one-drug out validation strategy, comparing it against the original DeepCDR framework and a prior scFoundation-based approach. scGPT not only outperforms previous approaches but also exhibits greater training stability, highlighting the value of leveraging scGPT-derived knowledge in this domain.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

This study explores the application of RAG-enhanced LLMs coupled with pathology foundation models for thyroid cytology diagnosis, addressing challenges in cytological interpretation, standardization, and diagnostic accuracy. By leveraging a curated knowledge base, RAG facilitates dy-namic retrieval of relevant case studies, diagnostic criteria, and expert interpreta-tion, improving the contextual understanding of LLMs. Meanwhile, pathology foun-dation models, trained on high-resolution pathology images, refine feature extrac-tion and classification capabilities. The fusion of these AI-driven approaches en-hances diagnostic consistency, reduces variability, and supports pathologists in dis-tinguishing benign from malignant thyroid lesions. Our results demonstrate that integrating RAG with pathology-specific LLMs significantly improves diagnostic efficiency and interpretability, paving the way for AI-assisted thyroid cytopathology, with foundation model UNI achieving AUC 0.73-0.93 for correct prediction of surgi-cal pathology diagnosis from thyroid cytology samples.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in machine learning (ML), especially with foundation models (FMs) trained on extensive datasets, excel in extracting features and show promise in disaster management. Nevertheless, these models often inherit biases from training data, challenging their performance over extreme values. To explore the reliability of FM in the context of extreme events, we introduce \textbf{ExE}Bench (\textbf{Ex}treme \textbf{E}arth Benchmark), a collection of seven extreme event categories across floods, wildfires, storms, tropical cyclones, extreme precipitation, heatwaves, and cold waves. The dataset features global coverage, varying data volumes, and diverse data sources with different spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics. To broaden the real-world impact of FMs, we include multiple challenging ML tasks that are closely aligned with operational needs in extreme events detection, monitoring, and forecasting. ExEBench aims to (1) assess FM generalizability across diverse, high-impact tasks and domains, (2) promote the development of novel ML methods that benefit disaster management, and (3) offer a platform for analyzing the interactions and cascading effects of extreme events to advance our understanding of Earth system, especially under the climate change expected in the decades to come.

We present Meta-EyeFM, a multi-function foundation model that integrates a large language model (LLM) with vision foundation models (VFMs) for ocular disease assessment. Meta-EyeFM leverages a routing mechanism to enable accurate task-specific analysis based on text queries. Using Low Rank Adaptation, we fine-tuned our VFMs to detect ocular and systemic diseases, differentiate ocular disease severity, and identify common ocular signs. The model achieved 100% accuracy in routing fundus images to appropriate VFMs, which achieved $\ge$ 82.2% accuracy in disease detection, $\ge$ 89% in severity differentiation, $\ge$ 76% in sign identification. Meta-EyeFM was 11% to 43% more accurate than Gemini-1.5-flash and ChatGPT-4o LMMs in detecting various eye diseases and comparable to an ophthalmologist. This system offers enhanced usability and diagnostic performance, making it a valuable decision support tool for primary eye care or an online LLM for fundus evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reciprocity as the Foundational Substrate of Society: How Reciprocal Dynamics Scale into Social Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08319v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major bottleneck in multi-agent AI is the lack of simulateable models for the bottom-up emergence of social structure under realistic behavioral constraints. Similarly, many foundational theories in economics and sociology including the concepts of "institutions" and "norms" tend to describe social structures post hoc, often relying on implicit assumptions of shared culture, morality, or symbolic agreement. These concepts are often treated as primitives rather than reconstructed from agent-level behavior, leaving both their origins and operational definitions under-specified. To address this, we propose a three-stage bottom-up framework: Reciprocal Dynamics, capturing individual-level reciprocal exchanges; Norm Stabilization, the consolidation of shared expectations; and Institutional Construction, the externalization of stable patterns into scalable structures. By grounding social emergence in agent-level reciprocity, our framework enables the systematic exploration of how moral, cultural, and institutional structures emerge from cognitively minimal interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First draft extending the first position paper.

However, optimizing SFMs for SIP-HI has been insufficiently explored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study to identify key design factors affecting SIP-HI performance with 5 SFMs, focusing on encoder layer selection, prediction head architecture, and ensemble configurations. Our findings show that, contrary to traditional use-all-layers methods, selecting a single encoder layer yields better results. Additionally, temporal modeling is crucial for effective prediction heads. We also demonstrate that ensembling multiple SFMs improves performance, with stronger individual models providing greater benefit. Finally, we explore the relationship between key SFM attributes and their impact on SIP-HI performance. Our study offers practical insights into effectively adapting SFMs for speech intelligibility prediction for hearing-impaired populations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Models Knowledge Distillation For Battery Capacity Degradation Forecast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08151v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of lithium-ion battery capacity degradation is critical for enhancing the reliability and safety of battery operations. Traditional expert models, tailored to specific scenarios, provide isolated estimations. With the rapid advancement of data-driven techniques, a series of general-purpose time-series foundation models have been developed. However, foundation models specifically designed for battery capacity degradation remain largely unexplored. To enable zero-shot generalization in battery degradation prediction using large model technology, this study proposes a degradation-aware fine-tuning strategy for time-series foundation models. We apply this strategy to fine-tune the Timer model on approximately 10 GB of open-source battery charge discharge data. Validation on our released CycleLife-SJTUIE dataset demonstrates that the fine-tuned Battery-Timer possesses strong zero-shot generalization capability in capacity degradation forecasting. To address the computational challenges of deploying large models, we further propose a knowledge distillation framework that transfers the knowledge of pre-trained foundation models into compact expert models. Distillation results across several state-of-the-art time-series expert models confirm that foundation model knowledge significantly improves the multi-condition generalization of expert models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision Foundation Model Embedding-Based Semantic Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07998v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic anomalies are contextually invalid or unusual combinations of familiar visual elements that can cause undefined behavior and failures in system-level reasoning for autonomous systems. This work explores semantic anomaly detection by leveraging the semantic priors of state-of-the-art vision foundation models, operating directly on the image. We propose a framework that compares local vision embeddings from runtime images to a database of nominal scenarios in which the autonomous system is deemed safe and performant. In this work, we consider two variants of the proposed framework: one using raw grid-based embeddings, and another leveraging instance segmentation for object-centric representations. To further improve robustness, we introduce a simple filtering mechanism to suppress false positives. Our evaluations on CARLA-simulated anomalies show that the instance-based method with filtering achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, while providing precise anomaly localization. These results highlight the potential utility of vision embeddings from foundation models for real-time anomaly detection in autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the Workshop "Safely Leveraging Vision-Language Foundation Models in Robotics: Challenges and Opportunities" at ICRA 2025</p></details> |

The framework is explicitly capable of overwriting its own learning algorithm under formally bounded risk. Building upon the Noise-to-Meaning RSI (N2M-RSI) foundation, EG-MRSI introduces a differentiable intrinsic reward function driven by confidence, error, novelty, and cumulative success. This signal regulates both a metacognitive mapping and a self-modification operator constrained by provable safety mechanisms. We formally define the initial agent configuration, emotion-gradient dynamics, and RSI trigger conditions, and derive a reinforcement-compatible optimization objective that guides the agent's development trajectory. Meaning Density and Meaning Conversion Efficiency are introduced as quantifiable metrics of semantic learning, closing the gap between internal structure and predictive informativeness. This Part I paper establishes the single-agent theoretical foundations of EG-MRSI. Future parts will extend this framework to include safety certificates and rollback protocols (Part II), collective intelligence mechanisms (Part III), and feasibility constraints including thermodynamic and computational limits (Part IV). Together, the EG-MRSI series provides a rigorous, extensible foundation for open-ended and safe AGI.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Multimodal Survival Modeling in the Age of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07683v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has enabled novel discoveries and served as a large-scale reference through its harmonized genomics, clinical, and image data. Prior studies have trained bespoke cancer survival prediction models from unimodal or multimodal TCGA data. A modern paradigm in biomedical deep learning is the development of foundation models (FMs) to derive meaningful feature embeddings, agnostic to a specific modeling task. Biomedical text especially has seen growing development of FMs. While TCGA contains free-text data as pathology reports, these have been historically underutilized. Here, we investigate the feasibility of training classical, multimodal survival models over zero-shot embeddings extracted by FMs. We show the ease and additive effect of multimodal fusion, outperforming unimodal models. We demonstrate the benefit of including pathology report text and rigorously evaluate the effect of model-based text summarization and hallucination. Overall, we modernize survival modeling by leveraging FMs and information extraction from pathology reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Foundation models, pre-trained on diverse datasets, can be applied in a zero-shot setting with minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare Google's TimesFM model to conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH and Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), using 19 years of daily returns from the SP 100 index and its constituents. Backtesting with over 8.5 years of out-of-sample data shows that the fine-tuned foundation model consistently outperforms traditional methods in actual-over-expected ratios. For the quantile score loss function, it performs comparably to the best econometric model, GAS. Overall, the foundation model ranks as the best or among the top performers across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 quantile forecasting. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy, showing that zero-shot use is not optimal for VaR.</p></details> |  |

However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems.

These models are distinguished by their scalability and the ease with which they can be adapted through the exploitation of Transfer Learning. The availability of high computational power and large datasets have supported their development, achieving a high generalization capacity due to the enormous and heterogeneous amounts of data used in their initial training. These characteristics contribute to a solid base that can be adapted or adjusted to a wide range of tasks, increasing their applicability. This study proposes the methodology LLIAM, a straightforward adaptation of a kind of FM, Large Language Models, for the Time Series Forecasting task. An adequate time-series prompting schema and Low-Rank Adaptations are used to enhance the knowledge of the model with diverse time series datasets, known as the fine-tuning phase. A study divided in two stages has been performed for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Initially, a comparison was made between the performance of LLIAM and different state-of-the-art DL algorithms, including Recurrent Neural Networks and Temporal Convolutional Networks, as well as a LLM-based method, TimeLLM. Following this, a zero-shot study is presented in order to evaluate the generalization capacity of the proposed methodology with time series datasets from unknown domains not considered in the model training. The outcomes of this investigation demonstrate the efficacy of LLIAM, highlighting that this straightforward and general approach can attain competent results without the necessity for applying complex modifications. This work also encourages the use of available resources (such as these pre-trained models) and efficient fine-tuning techniques to avoid unnecessary and costly training, narrowing the gap between the goals of traditional AI and Green AI.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present Mogao, a unified framework that advances this paradigm by enabling interleaved multi-modal generation through a causal approach. Mogao integrates a set of key technical improvements in architecture design, including a deep-fusion design, dual vision encoders, interleaved rotary position embeddings, and multi-modal classifier-free guidance, which allow it to harness the strengths of both autoregressive models for text generation and diffusion models for high-quality image synthesis. These practical improvements also make Mogao particularly effective to process interleaved sequences of text and images arbitrarily. To further unlock the potential of unified models, we introduce an efficient training strategy on a large-scale, in-house dataset specifically curated for joint text and image generation. Extensive experiments show that Mogao not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal understanding and text-to-image generation, but also excels in producing high-quality, coherent interleaved outputs. Its emergent capabilities in zero-shot image editing and compositional generation highlight Mogao as a practical omni-modal foundation model, paving the way for future development and scaling the unified multi-modal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Mogao...</summary><p>Mogao Technical Report</p></details> |

However, the acquisition of high-resolution SAR images in airborne configurations, remains costly and limited. Thus, the lack of open source, well-labeled, or easily exploitable SAR text-image datasets is a barrier to the use of existing foundation models in remote sensing applications. In this context, synthetic image generation is a promising solution to augment this scarce data, enabling a broader range of applications. Leveraging over 15 years of ONERA's extensive archival airborn data from acquisition campaigns, we created a comprehensive training dataset of 110 thousands SAR images to exploit a 3.5 billion parameters pre-trained latent diffusion model \cite{Baqu2019SethiR}. In this work, we present a novel approach utilizing spatial conditioning techniques within a foundation model to transform satellite SAR imagery into airborne SAR representations. Additionally, we demonstrate that our pipeline is effective for bridging the realism of simulated images generated by ONERA's physics-based simulator EMPRISE \cite{empriseem_ai_images}. Our method explores a key application of AI in advancing SAR imaging technology. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce this approach in the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vision-Language Foundation Model for Leaf Disease Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07019v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leaf disease identification plays a pivotal role in smart agriculture. However, many existing studies still struggle to integrate image and textual modalities to compensate for each other's limitations. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on pretraining with constrained datasets such as ImageNet, which lack domain-specific information. We propose SCOLD (Soft-target COntrastive learning for Leaf Disease identification), a context-aware vision-language foundation model tailored to address these challenges for agricultural tasks. SCOLD is developed using a diverse corpus of plant leaf images and corresponding symptom descriptions, comprising over 186,000 image-caption pairs aligned with 97 unique concepts. Through task-agnostic pretraining, SCOLD leverages contextual soft targets to mitigate overconfidence in contrastive learning by smoothing labels, thereby improving model generalization and robustness on fine-grained classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SCOLD outperforms existing vision-language models such as OpenAI-CLIP-L, BioCLIP, and SigLIP2 across several benchmarks, including zero-shot and few-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and image classification, while maintaining a competitive parameter footprint. Ablation studies further highlight SCOLD's effectiveness in contrast to its counterparts. The proposed approach significantly advances the agricultural vision-language foundation model, offering strong performance with minimal or no supervised fine-tuning. This work lays a solid groundwork for future research on models trained with long-form and simplified contexts, tasks involving class ambiguity, and multi-modal systems for intelligent plant disease diagnostics.

However, their widespread adoption raises critical concerns regarding trustworthiness across dimensions. This paper presents a comprehensive framework to address these challenges through three key contributions. First, we systematically review global AI governance laws and policies from governments and regulatory bodies, as well as industry practices and standards. Based on this analysis, we propose a set of guiding principles for GenFMs, developed through extensive multidisciplinary collaboration that integrates technical, ethical, legal, and societal perspectives. Second, we introduce TrustGen, the first dynamic benchmarking platform designed to evaluate trustworthiness across multiple dimensions and model types, including text-to-image, large language, and vision-language models. TrustGen leverages modular components--metadata curation, test case generation, and contextual variation--to enable adaptive and iterative assessments, overcoming the limitations of static evaluation methods. Using TrustGen, we reveal significant progress in trustworthiness while identifying persistent challenges. Finally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the challenges and future directions for trustworthy GenFMs, which reveals the complex, evolving nature of trustworthiness, highlighting the nuanced trade-offs between utility and trustworthiness, and consideration for various downstream applications, identifying persistent challenges and providing a strategic roadmap for future research. This work establishes a holistic framework for advancing trustworthiness in GenAI, paving the way for safer and more responsible integration of GenFMs into critical applications.

A Survey on Foundation Models for Personalized Federated Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06907v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok-3, has reshaped the artificial intelligence landscape. As prominent examples of foundational models (FMs) built on LLMs, these models exhibit remarkable capabilities in generating human-like content, bringing us closer to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, their large-scale nature, sensitivity to privacy concerns, and substantial computational demands present significant challenges to personalized customization for end users. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the vision of artificial personalized intelligence (API), focusing on adapting these powerful models to meet the specific needs and preferences of users while maintaining privacy and efficiency. Specifically, this paper proposes personalized federated intelligence (PFI), which integrates the privacy-preserving advantages of federated learning (FL) with the zero-shot generalization capabilities of FMs, enabling personalized, efficient, and privacy-protective deployment at the edge. We first review recent advances in both FL and FMs, and discuss the potential of leveraging FMs to enhance federated systems. We then present the key motivations behind realizing PFI and explore promising opportunities in this space, including efficient PFI, trustworthy PFI, and PFI empowered by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Finally, we outline key challenges and future research directions for deploying FM-powered FL systems at the edge with improved personalization, computational efficiency, and privacy guarantees. Overall, this survey aims to lay the groundwork for the development of API as a complement to AGI, with a particular focus on PFI as a key enabling technique.</p></details> | On going work |
| **[Long Term Memory: The Foundation of AI Self-Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15665v4)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) like GPTs, trained on vast datasets, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in language understanding, reasoning, and planning, achieving human-level performance in various tasks. Most studies focus on enhancing these models by training on ever-larger datasets to build more powerful foundation models. While training stronger models is important, enabling models to evolve during inference is equally crucial, a process we refer to as AI self-evolution. Unlike large-scale training, self-evolution may rely on limited data or interactions. Inspired by the columnar organization of the human cerebral cortex, we hypothesize that AI models could develop cognitive abilities and build internal representations through iterative interactions with their environment. To achieve this, models need long-term memory (LTM) to store and manage processed interaction data. LTM supports self-evolution by representing diverse experiences across environments and agents. In this report, we explore AI self-evolution and its potential to enhance models during inference. We examine LTM's role in lifelong learning, allowing models to evolve based on accumulated interactions. We outline the structure of LTM and the systems needed for effective data retention and representation. We also classify approaches for building personalized models with LTM data and show how these models achieve self-evolution through interaction. Using LTM, our multi-agent framework OMNE achieved first place on the GAIA benchmark, demonstrating LTM's potential for AI self-evolution. Finally, we present a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the importance of LTM for advancing AI technology and its practical applications.</p></details> | 56 pages, 13 figures |

The key idea is to create a networking ecosystem to support a diverse range of autonomous and embodied AI agents in fulfilling their goals. In this paper, we focus on the novel challenges and requirements of agentic AI networking. We propose AgentNet, a novel framework for supporting interaction, collaborative learning, and knowledge transfer among AI agents. We introduce a general architectural framework of AgentNet and then propose a generative foundation model (GFM)-based implementation in which multiple GFM-as-agents have been created as an interactive knowledge-base to bootstrap the development of embodied AI agents according to different task requirements and environmental features. We consider two application scenarios, digital-twin-based industrial automation and metaverse-based infotainment system, to describe how to apply AgentNet for supporting efficient task-driven collaboration and interaction among AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |

Yet climate variability, habitat loss, and data limitations in remote ecosystems that lack basic infrastructure support pose significant challenges to effective fisheries management. This project explores the integration of multimodal foundation AI and expert-in-the-loop frameworks to enhance wild salmon monitoring and sustainable fisheries management in Indigenous rivers across Pacific Northwest. By leveraging video and sonar-based monitoring, we develop AI-powered tools for automated species identification, counting, and length measurement, reducing manual effort, expediting delivery of results, and improving decision-making accuracy. Expert validation and active learning frameworks ensure ecological relevance while reducing annotation burdens. To address unique technical and societal challenges, we bring together a cross-domain, interdisciplinary team of university researchers, fisheries biologists, Indigenous stewardship practitioners, government agencies, and conservation organizations. Through these collaborations, our research fosters ethical AI co-development, open data sharing, and culturally informed fisheries management.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, accepted by IJCAI 2025, AI and Social Good Track</p></details> |

Despite the importance of the web, many tasks performed on it are repetitive and time-consuming, negatively impacting overall quality of life. To efficiently handle these tedious daily tasks, one of the most promising approaches is to advance autonomous agents based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, referred to as AI Agents, as they can operate continuously without fatigue or performance degradation. In the context of the web, leveraging AI Agents -- termed WebAgents -- to automatically assist people in handling tedious daily tasks can dramatically enhance productivity and efficiency. Recently, Large Foundation Models (LFMs) containing billions of parameters have exhibited human-like language understanding and reasoning capabilities, showing proficiency in performing various complex tasks. This naturally raises the question: `Can LFMs be utilized to develop powerful AI Agents that automatically handle web tasks, providing significant convenience to users?' To fully explore the potential of LFMs, extensive research has emerged on WebAgents designed to complete daily web tasks according to user instructions, significantly enhancing the convenience of daily human life. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies on WebAgents across three key aspects: architectures, training, and trustworthiness. Additionally, several promising directions for future research are explored to provide deeper insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025;</p></details> |
| **[Improving Generalization of Medical Image Registration Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06527v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deformable registration is a fundamental task in medical image processing, aiming to achieve precise alignment by establishing nonlinear correspondences between images. Traditional methods offer good adaptability and interpretability but are limited by computational efficiency. Although deep learning approaches have significantly improved registration speed and accuracy, they often lack flexibility and generalizability across different datasets and tasks. In recent years, foundation models have emerged as a promising direction, leveraging large and diverse datasets to learn universal features and transformation patterns for image registration, thus demonstrating strong cross-task transferability. However, these models still face challenges in generalization and robustness when encountering novel anatomical structures, varying imaging conditions, or unseen modalities. To address these limitations, this paper incorporates Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) into foundation models to enhance their generalization and robustness in medical image registration. By optimizing the flatness of the loss landscape, SAM improves model stability across diverse data distributions and strengthens its ability to handle complex clinical scenarios. Experimental results show that foundation models integrated with SAM achieve significant improvements in cross-dataset registration performance, offering new insights for the advancement of medical image registration technology.

| **[Adapting a Segmentation Foundation Model for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06217v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have shown strong performance in various vision tasks, particularly image segmentation, due to their impressive zero-shot segmentation capabilities. However, effectively adapting such models for medical image classification is still a less explored topic. In this paper, we introduce a new framework to adapt SAM for medical image classification. First, we utilize the SAM image encoder as a feature extractor to capture segmentation-based features that convey important spatial and contextual details of the image, while freezing its weights to avoid unnecessary overhead during training. Next, we propose a novel Spatially Localized Channel Attention (SLCA) mechanism to compute spatially localized attention weights for the feature maps. The features extracted from SAM's image encoder are processed through SLCA to compute attention weights, which are then integrated into deep learning classification models to enhance their focus on spatially relevant or meaningful regions of the image, thus improving classification performance. Experimental results on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and data-efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |

However, current transfer learning strategies devoted to full fine-tuning for transfer learning may require significant resources and yield sub-optimal results when the labeled data of the target task is scarce. This makes its applicability in real clinical settings challenging since these institutions are usually constrained on data and computational resources to develop proprietary solutions. To address this challenge, we formalize Few-Shot Efficient Fine-Tuning (FSEFT), a novel and realistic scenario for adapting medical image segmentation foundation models. This setting considers the key role of both data- and parameter-efficiency during adaptation. Building on a foundation model pre-trained on open-access CT organ segmentation sources, we propose leveraging Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and black-box Adapters to address such challenges. Furthermore, novel efficient adaptation methodologies are introduced in this work, which include Spatial black-box Adapters that are more appropriate for dense prediction tasks and constrained transductive inference, leveraging task-specific prior knowledge. Our comprehensive transfer learning experiments confirm the suitability of foundation models in medical image segmentation and unveil the limitations of popular fine-tuning strategies in few-shot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Medical Image Analysis.

While foundation models have been useful in natural language processing and some vision tasks for some time, the foundation model developed with image segmentation in mind - Segment Anything Model (SAM) - has been developed only recently and has shown similar promise. However, there are still no systematic analyses or "best-practice" guidelines for optimal fine-tuning of SAM for medical image segmentation. This work summarizes existing fine-tuning strategies with various backbone architectures, model components, and fine-tuning algorithms across 18 combinations, and evaluates them on 17 datasets covering all common radiology modalities. Our study reveals that (1) fine-tuning SAM leads to slightly better performance than previous segmentation methods, (2) fine-tuning strategies that use parameter-efficient learning in both the encoder and decoder are superior to other strategies, (3) network architecture has a small impact on final performance, (4) further training SAM with self-supervised learning can improve final model performance. We also demonstrate the ineffectiveness of some methods popular in the literature and further expand our experiments into few-shot and prompt-based settings. Lastly, we released our code and MRI-specific fine-tuned weights, which consistently obtained superior performance over the original SAM, at https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/finetune-SAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the Journal of Machine Learning for Biomedical Imaging (MELBA)</p></details> |

Despite its importance, traditional seismic processing techniques face challenges such as noisy and damaged data and the reliance on manual, time-consuming workflows. The emergence of deep learning approaches has introduced effective and user-friendly alternatives, yet many of these deep learning approaches rely on synthetic datasets and specialized neural networks. Recently, foundation models have gained traction in the seismic domain, due to their success in the natural image domain. Therefore, we investigate the application of natural image foundation models on the three seismic processing tasks: demultiple, interpolation, and denoising. We evaluate the impact of different model characteristics, such as pre-training technique and neural network architecture, on performance and efficiency. Rather than proposing a single seismic foundation model, we critically examine various natural image foundation models and suggest some promising candidates for future exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>In su...</summary><p>In submission to Geophysics</p></details> |

Single cell profiling offers insights into cellular heterogeneity, yet the application of large-scale foundation models for predicting drug response in single cell data remains underexplored. To address this, we developed scDrugMap, an integrated framework featuring both a Python command-line interface and a web server for drug response prediction. scDrugMap evaluates a wide range of foundation models, including eight single-cell models and two large language models, using a curated dataset of over 326,000 cells in the primary collection and 18,800 cells in the validation set, spanning 36 datasets and diverse tissue and cancer types. We benchmarked model performance under pooled-data and cross-data evaluation settings, employing both layer freezing and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning strategies. In the pooled-data scenario, scFoundation achieved the best performance, with mean F1 scores of 0.971 (layer freezing) and 0.947 (fine-tuning), outperforming the lowest-performing model by over 50%. In the cross-data setting, UCE excelled post fine-tuning (mean F1: 0.774), while scGPT led in zero-shot learning (mean F1: 0.858). Overall, scDrugMap provides the first large-scale benchmark of foundation models for drug response prediction in single-cell data and serves as a user-friendly, flexible platform for advancing drug discovery and translational research.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

We present PyTDC, an open-source machine-learning platform providing streamlined training, evaluation, and inference software for multimodal biological AI models. PyTDC unifies distributed, heterogeneous, continuously updated data sources and model weights and standardizes benchmarking and inference endpoints. This paper discusses the components of PyTDC's architecture and, to our knowledge, the first-of-its-kind case study on the introduced single-cell drug-target nomination ML task. We find state-of-the-art methods in graph representation learning and domain-specific methods from graph theory perform poorly on this task. Though we find a context-aware geometric deep learning method that outperforms the evaluated SoTA and domain-specific baseline methods, the model is unable to generalize to unseen cell types or incorporate additional modalities, highlighting PyTDC's capacity to facilitate an exciting avenue of research developing multimodal, context-aware, foundation models for open problems in biomedical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada.

| **[Griffin: Towards a Graph-Centric Relational Database Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05568v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Griffin, the first foundation model attemptation designed specifically for Relational Databases (RDBs). Unlike previous smaller models focused on single RDB tasks, Griffin unifies the data encoder and task decoder to handle diverse tasks. Additionally, we enhance the architecture by incorporating a cross-attention module and a novel aggregator. Griffin utilizes pretraining on both single-table and RDB datasets, employing advanced encoders for categorical, numerical, and metadata features, along with innovative components such as cross-attention modules and enhanced message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture the complexities of relational data. Evaluated on large-scale, heterogeneous, and temporal graphs extracted from RDBs across various domains (spanning over 150 million nodes), Griffin demonstrates superior or comparable performance to individually trained models, excels in low-data scenarios, and shows strong transferability with similarity and diversity in pretraining across new datasets and tasks, highlighting its potential as a universally applicable foundation model for RDBs.

In retinal imaging, foundation models pretrained on either natural or ophthalmic data have shown promise, but the benefits of in-domain pretraining remain uncertain. To investigate this, we benchmark six SSL-pretrained ViTs on seven digital fundus image (DFI) datasets totaling 70,000 expert-annotated images for the task of moderate-to-late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) identification. Our results show that iBOT pretrained on natural images achieves the highest out-of-distribution generalization, with AUROCs of 0.80-0.97, outperforming domain-specific models, which achieved AUROCs of 0.78-0.96 and a baseline ViT-L with no pretraining, which achieved AUROCs of 0.68-0.91. These findings highlight the value of foundation models in improving AMD identification and challenge the assumption that in-domain pretraining is necessary. Furthermore, we release BRAMD, an open-access dataset (n=587) of DFIs with AMD labels from Brazil.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Our analysis presents the following insights: i) Compared to LTSSL algorithms trained from scratch, FFT results in a decline in model performance, whereas LP and LFT, although boosting overall model performance, exhibit negligible benefits to tail classes. ii) LP produces numerous false pseudo-labels due to \textit{underlearned} training data, while LFT can reduce the number of these false labels but becomes overconfident about them owing to \textit{biased fitting} training data. This exacerbates the pseudo-labeled and classifier biases inherent in LTSSL, limiting performance improvement in the tail classes. With these insights, we propose a Unbiased Lightweight Fine-tuning strategy, \textbf{ULFine}, which mitigates the overconfidence via confidence-aware adaptive fitting of textual prototypes and counteracts the pseudo-labeled and classifier biases via complementary fusion of dual logits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULFine markedly decreases training costs by over ten times and substantially increases prediction accuracies compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are constrained to basic material types with limited predictable parameters, making them insufficient to represent the complexity of real-world materials. We introduce PhysFlow, a novel approach that leverages multi-modal foundation models and video diffusion to achieve enhanced 4D dynamic scene simulation. Our method utilizes multi-modal models to identify material types and initialize material parameters through image queries, while simultaneously inferring 3D Gaussian splats for detailed scene representation. We further refine these material parameters using video diffusion with a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) and optical flow guidance rather than render loss or Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. This integrated framework enables accurate prediction and realistic simulation of dynamic interactions in real-world scenarios, advancing both accuracy and flexibility in physics-based simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[Theoretical Foundations for Semantic Cognition in Artificial Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21218v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This monograph presents a modular cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence grounded in the formal modeling of belief as structured semantic state. Belief states are defined as dynamic ensembles of linguistic expressions embedded within a navigable manifold, where operators enable assimilation, abstraction, nullification, memory, and introspection. Drawing from philosophy, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we develop a layered framework that enables self-regulating epistemic agents capable of reflective, goal-directed thought. At the core of this framework is the epistemic vacuum: a class of semantically inert cognitive states that serves as the conceptual origin of belief space. From this foundation, the Null Tower arises as a generative structure recursively built through internal representational capacities. The theoretical constructs are designed to be implementable in both symbolic and neural systems, including large language models, hybrid agents, and adaptive memory architectures. This work offers a foundational substrate for constructing agents that reason, remember, and regulate their beliefs in structured, interpretable ways.</p></details> | <details><summary>248 p...</summary><p>248 pages, 77 figures</p></details> |

Nowadays, existing deep learning methods for natural products research primarily rely on supervised learning approaches designed for specific downstream tasks. However, such one-model-for-a-task paradigm often lacks generalizability and leaves significant room for performance improvement. Additionally, existing molecular characterization methods are not well-suited for the unique tasks associated with natural products. To address these limitations, we have pre-trained a foundation model for natural products based on their unique properties. Our approach employs a novel pretraining strategy that is especially tailored to natural products. By incorporating contrastive learning and masked graph learning objectives, we emphasize evolutional information from molecular scaffolds while capturing side-chain information. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in various downstream tasks related to natural product mining and drug discovery. We first compare taxonomy classification with synthesized molecule-focused baselines to demonstrate that current models are inadequate for understanding natural synthesis. Furthermore, by diving into a fine-grained analysis at both the gene and microbial levels, NaFM demonstrates the ability to capture evolutionary information. Eventually, our method is experimented with virtual screening, illustrating informative natural product representations that can lead to more effective identification of potential drug candidates.</p></details> |  |

However, the optimal scene encoding strategies for various scenarios remain unclear, particularly compared to their image-based counterparts. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive study that probes various visual encoding models for 3D scene understanding, identifying the strengths and limitations of each model across different scenarios. Our evaluation spans seven vision foundation encoders, including image-based, video-based, and 3D foundation models. We evaluate these models in four tasks: Vision-Language Scene Reasoning, Visual Grounding, Segmentation, and Registration, each focusing on different aspects of scene understanding. Our evaluations yield key findings: DINOv2 demonstrates superior performance, video models excel in object-level tasks, diffusion models benefit geometric tasks, and language-pretrained models show unexpected limitations in language-related tasks. These insights challenge some conventional understandings, provide novel perspectives on leveraging visual foundation models, and highlight the need for more flexible encoder selection in future vision-language and scene-understanding tasks.

These issues are especially critical in medical imaging. To address these limitations, we propose an Organ-Wise Tokenization (OWT) framework with a Token Group-based Reconstruction (TGR) training paradigm. Unlike conventional approaches that produce holistic features, OWT explicitly disentangles an image into separable token groups, each corresponding to a distinct organ or semantic entity. Our design ensures each token group encapsulates organ-specific information, boosting interpretability, generalization, and efficiency while allowing fine-grained control in downstream tasks. Experiments on CT and MRI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OWT in not only achieving strong image reconstruction and segmentation performance, but also enabling novel semantic-level generation and retrieval applications that are out of reach for standard holistic embedding methods. These findings underscore the potential of OWT as a foundational framework for semantically disentangled representation learning, offering broad scalability and applicability to real-world medical imaging scenarios and beyond.</p></details> |  |

However, existing AI methods struggle with generalization across variables and geographies and are constrained by the quadratic complexity of Vision Transformer (ViT) self-attention. We introduce ORBIT-2, a scalable foundation model for global, hyper-resolution climate downscaling. ORBIT-2 incorporates two key innovations: (1) Residual Slim ViT (Reslim), a lightweight architecture with residual learning and Bayesian regularization for efficient, robust prediction; and (2) TILES, a tile-wise sequence scaling algorithm that reduces self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear, enabling long-sequence processing and massive parallelism. ORBIT-2 scales to 10 billion parameters across 32,768 GPUs, achieving up to 1.8 ExaFLOPS sustained throughput and 92-98% strong scaling efficiency. It supports downscaling to 0.9 km global resolution and processes sequences up to 4.2 billion tokens. On 7 km resolution benchmarks, ORBIT-2 achieves high accuracy with R^2 scores in the range of 0.98 to 0.99 against observation data.</p></details> |  |
| **[ALFEE: Adaptive Large Foundation Model for EEG Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06291v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While foundation models excel in text, image, and video domains, the critical biological signals, particularly electroencephalography(EEG), remain underexplored. EEG benefits neurological research with its high temporal resolution, operational practicality, and safety profile. However, low signal-to-noise ratio, inter-subject variability, and cross-paradigm differences hinder the generalization of current models. Existing methods often employ simplified strategies, such as a single loss function or a channel-temporal joint representation module, and suffer from a domain gap between pretraining and evaluation tasks that compromises efficiency and adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose the Adaptive Large Foundation model for EEG signal representation(ALFEE) framework, a novel hybrid transformer architecture with two learning stages for robust EEG representation learning. ALFEE employs a hybrid attention that separates channel-wise feature aggregation from temporal dynamics modeling, enabling robust EEG representation with variable channel configurations. A channel encoder adaptively compresses variable channel information, a temporal encoder captures task-guided evolution, and a hybrid decoder reconstructs signals in both temporal and frequency domains. During pretraining, ALFEE optimizes task prediction, channel and temporal mask reconstruction, and temporal forecasting to enhance multi-scale and multi-channel representation. During fine-tuning, a full-model adaptation with a task-specific token dictionary and a cross-attention layer boosts performance across multiple tasks. After 25,000 hours of pretraining, extensive experimental results on six downstream EEG tasks demonstrate the superior performance of ALFEE over existing models. Our ALFEE framework establishes a scalable foundation for biological signal analysis with implementation at https://github.com/xw1216/ALFEE.</p></details> | 17pages, 17 figures |

How is coordination and cooperation in social activity possible? What is the minimal mental architecture of a social agent? How is the information about the state of the world related to the agents intentions? How are the intentions of agents related? What role does communication play in this coordination process? This essay explores the conceptual and logical foundations of artificial social intelligence in the context of a society of multiple agents that communicate and cooperate to achieve some end. An attempt is made to provide an introduction to some of the key concepts, their formal definitions and their interrelationships. These include the notion of a changing social world of multiple agents. The logic of social intelligence goes beyond classical logic by linking information with strategic thought. A minimal architecture of social agents is presented. The agents have different dynamically changing, possible choices and abilities. The agents also have uncertainty, lacking perfect information about their physical state as well as their dynamic social state. The social state of an agent includes the intentional state of that agent, as well as, that agent's representation of the intentional states of other agents. Furthermore, it includes the evaluations agents make of their physical and social condition. Communication, semantic and pragmatic meaning and their relationship to intention and information states are investigated. The logic of agent abilities and intentions are motivated and formalized. The entropy of group strategic states is defined.</p></details> |  |
| **[FAST: Federated Active Learning with Foundation Models for Communication-efficient Sampling and Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03783v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Active Learning (FAL) has emerged as a promising framework to leverage large quantities of unlabeled data across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, real-world deployments remain limited by high annotation costs and communication-intensive sampling processes, particularly in a cross-silo setting, when clients possess substantial local datasets. This paper addresses the crucial question: What is the best practice to reduce communication costs in human-in-the-loop learning with minimal annotator effort? Existing FAL methods typically rely on iterative annotation processes that separate active sampling from federated updates, leading to multiple rounds of expensive communication and annotation. In response, we introduce FAST, a two-pass FAL framework that harnesses foundation models for weak labeling in a preliminary pass, followed by a refinement pass focused exclusively on the most uncertain samples. By leveraging representation knowledge from foundation models and integrating refinement steps into a streamlined workflow, FAST substantially reduces the overhead incurred by iterative active sampling. Extensive experiments on diverse medical and natural image benchmarks demonstrate that FAST outperforms existing FAL methods by an average of 4.36% while reducing communication rounds eightfold under a limited 5% labeling budget.</p></details> |  |

There is a wide variety of knowledge patterns embedded in the graph data, such as node properties and clusters, which are crucial to learning generalized representations for GFMs. However, existing surveys of GFMs have several shortcomings: they lack comprehensiveness regarding the most recent progress, have unclear categorization of self-supervised methods, and take a limited architecture-based perspective that is restricted to only certain types of graph models. As the ultimate goal of GFMs is to learn generalized graph knowledge, we provide a comprehensive survey of self-supervised GFMs from a novel knowledge-based perspective. We propose a knowledge-based taxonomy, which categorizes self-supervised graph models by the specific graph knowledge utilized. Our taxonomy consists of microscopic (nodes, links, etc.), mesoscopic (context, clusters, etc.), and macroscopic knowledge (global structure, manifolds, etc.).

Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) are characterized by significantly larger scales (e.g., billions or trillions of parameters) compared to typical artificial intelligence (AI) models. LAMs exhibit outstanding cognitive abilities, including strong generalization capabilities for fine-tuning to downstream tasks, and emergent capabilities to handle tasks unseen during training. Therefore, LAMs efficiently provide AI services for diverse communication applications, making them crucial tools for addressing complex challenges in future wireless communication systems. This study provides a comprehensive review of the foundations, applications, and challenges of LAMs in communication. First, we introduce the current state of AI-based communication systems, emphasizing the motivation behind integrating LAMs into communications and summarizing the key contributions. We then present an overview of the essential concepts of LAMs in communication. This includes an introduction to the main architectures of LAMs, such as transformer, diffusion models, and mamba. We also explore the classification of LAMs, including large language models (LLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs), and world models, and examine their potential applications in communication. Additionally, we cover the training methods and evaluation techniques for LAMs in communication systems. Lastly, we introduce optimization strategies such as chain of thought (CoT), retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and agentic systems. Following this, we discuss the research advancements of LAMs across various communication scenarios. Finally, we analyze the challenges in the current research and provide insights into potential future research directions.</p></details> |  |

In the field of Earth observation, over 75 remote sensing vision foundation models have been developed in the past four years. However, none has consistently outperformed the others across all available downstream tasks. To facilitate their comparison, we propose a cost-effective method for predicting a model's performance on multiple downstream tasks without the need for fine-tuning on each one. This method is based on what we call "capabilities encoding." The utility of this novel approach is twofold: we demonstrate its potential to simplify the selection of a foundation model for a given new task, and we employ it to offer a fresh perspective on the existing literature, suggesting avenues for future research.

However, existing models rely heavily on real-world data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative, yet its potential remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we explore the feasibility of training Vision-Language-Action models entirely with large-scale synthetic action data. We curate SynGrasp-1B, a billion-frame robotic grasping dataset generated in simulation with photorealistic rendering and extensive domain randomization. Building on this, we present GraspVLA, a VLA model pretrained on large-scale synthetic action data as a foundational model for grasping tasks. GraspVLA integrates autoregressive perception tasks and flow-matching-based action generation into a unified Chain-of-Thought process, enabling joint training on synthetic action data and Internet semantics data. This design helps mitigate sim-to-real gaps and facilitates the transfer of learned actions to a broader range of Internet-covered objects, achieving open-vocabulary generalization in grasping. Extensive evaluations across real-world and simulation benchmarks demonstrate GraspVLA's advanced zero-shot generalizability and few-shot adaptability to specific human preferences. We will release SynGrasp-1B dataset and pre-trained weights to benefit the community.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods face limitations related to segmentation quality, scalability, and the range of applicable imaging modalities. In this paper, we uncover the potential of the internal representations within frozen medical foundation diffusion models as highly efficient zero-shot learners for tumor segmentation by introducing a novel framework named DiffuGTS. DiffuGTS creates anomaly-aware open-vocabulary attention maps based on text prompts to enable generalizable anomaly segmentation without being restricted by a predefined training category list. To further improve and refine anomaly segmentation masks, DiffuGTS leverages the diffusion model, transforming pathological regions into high-quality pseudo-healthy counterparts through latent space inpainting, and applies a novel pixel-level and feature-level residual learning approach, resulting in segmentation masks with significantly enhanced quality and generalization. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets and seven tumor categories demonstrate the superior performance of our method, surpassing current state-of-the-art models across multiple zero-shot settings.

Rather than merely reacting to commands, it would continuously listen, reason, and respond proactively, fostering fluid, dynamic, and emotionally resonant interactions. We introduce Voila, a family of large voice-language foundation models that make a step towards this vision. Voila moves beyond traditional pipeline systems by adopting a new end-to-end architecture that enables full-duplex, low-latency conversations while preserving rich vocal nuances such as tone, rhythm, and emotion. It achieves a response latency of just 195 milliseconds, surpassing the average human response time. Its hierarchical multi-scale Transformer integrates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with powerful acoustic modeling, enabling natural, persona-aware voice generation -- where users can simply write text instructions to define the speaker's identity, tone, and other characteristics. Moreover, Voila supports over one million pre-built voices and efficient customization of new ones from brief audio samples as short as 10 seconds. Beyond spoken dialogue, Voila is designed as a unified model for a wide range of voice-based applications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and, with minimal adaptation, multilingual speech translation. Voila is fully open-sourced to support open research and accelerate progress toward next-generation human-machine interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, Website: https://voila.maitrix.org</p></details> |

Sparse-view reconstruction reduces radiation by using fewer X-ray projections while maintaining image quality, yet existing methods face challenges such as high computational demands and poor generalizability to different datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose DeepSparse, the first foundation model for sparse-view CBCT reconstruction, featuring DiCE (Dual-Dimensional Cross-Scale Embedding), a novel network that integrates multi-view 2D features and multi-scale 3D features. Additionally, we introduce the HyViP (Hybrid View Sampling Pretraining) framework, which pretrains the model on large datasets with both sparse-view and dense-view projections, and a two-step finetuning strategy to adapt and refine the model for new datasets. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our proposed DeepSparse achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods, paving the way for safer and more efficient CBCT imaging.</p></details> |  |

| **[Impact of Noisy Supervision in Foundation Model Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06869v3)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are usually pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then adapted to downstream tasks through tuning. However, the large-scale pre-training datasets, often inaccessible or too expensive to handle, can contain label noise that may adversely affect the generalization of the model and pose unexpected risks. This paper stands out as the first work to comprehensively understand and analyze the nature of noise in pre-training datasets and then effectively mitigate its impacts on downstream tasks. Specifically, through extensive experiments of fully-supervised and image-text contrastive pre-training on synthetic noisy ImageNet-1K, YFCC15M, and CC12M datasets, we demonstrate that, while slight noise in pre-training can benefit in-domain (ID) performance, where the training and testing data share a similar distribution, it always deteriorates out-of-domain (OOD) performance, where training and testing distributions are significantly different. These observations are agnostic to scales of pre-training datasets, pre-training noise types, model architectures, pre-training objectives, downstream tuning methods, and downstream applications. We empirically ascertain that the reason behind this is that the pre-training noise shapes the feature space differently. We then propose a tuning method (NMTune) to affine the feature space to mitigate the malignant effect of noise and improve generalization, which is applicable in both parameter-efficient and black-box tuning manners. We additionally conduct extensive experiments on popular vision and language models, including APIs, which are supervised and self-supervised pre-trained on realistic noisy data for evaluation. Our analysis and results demonstrate the importance of this novel and fundamental research direction, which we term as Noisy Model Learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables, preprint. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2309.17002</p></details> |

However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and traditional software testing methodologies, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (pfs) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we introduce Risk Estimation Fidelity (REF), a novel metric to certify the alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, ensuring simulation-based safety claims are statistically defensible.</p></details> | under review |

In the medical domain, however, the development of comprehensive foundation models is constrained by limited access to diverse modalities and stringent privacy regulations. To address these constraints, this study introduces a novel knowledge injection approach, FedKIM, designed to scale the medical foundation model within a federated learning framework. FedKIM leverages lightweight local models to extract healthcare knowledge from private data and integrates this knowledge into a centralized foundation model using a designed adaptive Multitask Multimodal Mixture Of Experts (M3OE) module. This method not only preserves privacy but also enhances the model's ability to handle complex medical tasks involving multiple modalities. Our extensive experiments across twelve tasks in seven modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKIM in various settings, highlighting its potential to scale medical foundation models without direct access to sensitive data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP'24 Main</p></details> |

Among the various approaches, the fine-tuning paradigm has gained considerable interest with the advent of foundation models. However, most existing methods primarily focus on leveraging knowledge from these models, overlooking the inherent biases introduced by the imbalanced training data they rely on. In this paper, we examine how such imbalances from pre-training affect long-tailed downstream tasks. Specifically, we find the imbalance biases inherited in foundation models on downstream task as parameter imbalance and data imbalance. During fine-tuning, we observe that parameter imbalance plays a more critical role, while data imbalance can be mitigated using existing re-balancing strategies. Moreover, we find that parameter imbalance cannot be effectively addressed by current re-balancing techniques, such as adjusting the logits, during training, unlike data imbalance. To tackle both imbalances simultaneously, we build our method on causal learning and view the incomplete semantic factor as the confounder, which brings spurious correlations between input samples and labels. To resolve the negative effects of this, we propose a novel backdoor adjustment method that learns the true causal effect between input samples and labels, rather than merely fitting the correlations in the data. Notably, we achieve an average performance increase of about $1.67\%$ on each dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper in ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Feature Upsampling Methods for Vision Foundation Models using Interactive Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02075v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) are large-scale, pre-trained models that serve as general-purpose backbones for various computer vision tasks. As VFMs' popularity grows, there is an increasing interest in understanding their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks. However, VFMs typically produce low-resolution features, limiting their direct applicability in this context. One way to tackle this limitation is by employing a task-agnostic feature upsampling module that refines VFM features resolution. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we investigate Interactive Segmentation (IS) as a novel benchmark for evaluating feature upsampling methods on VFMs. Due to its inherent multimodal input, consisting of an image and a set of user-defined clicks, as well as its dense mask output, IS creates a challenging environment that demands comprehensive visual scene understanding. Our benchmarking experiments show that selecting appropriate upsampling strategies significantly improves VFM features quality.

On the one hand, FL, as a collaborative learning paradigm, help address challenges in FM development by expanding data availability, enabling computation sharing, facilitating the collaborative development of FMs, tackling continuous data update, avoiding FM monopoly, response delay and FM service down. On the other hand, FM, equipped with pre-trained knowledge and exceptional performance, can serve as a robust starting point for FL. It can also generate synthetic data to enrich data diversity and enhance overall performance of FL. Meanwhile, FM unlocks new sharing paradigm and multi-task and multi-modality capabilities for FL. By examining the interplay between FL and FM, this paper presents the motivations, challenges, and future directions of empowering FL with FM and empowering FM with FL. We hope that this work provides a good foundation to inspire future research efforts to drive advancements in both fields.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we introduce SE Arena, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SE Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons.

Moreover, SE Arena incorporates a new feature called RepoChat, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes.

Accurate and reliable pain evaluation for the people suffering is crucial to developing effective and advanced pain management protocols. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support decision-making processes, ultimately aiming to alleviate distress and prevent functionality decline. This study introduces PainFormer, a vision foundation model based on multi-task learning principles trained simultaneously on 14 tasks/datasets with a total of 10.9 million samples.

The proposed framework is evaluated on two pain datasets, BioVid and AI4Pain, and directly compared to 73 different methodologies documented in the literature. Experiments conducted in unimodal and multimodal settings demonstrate state-of-the-art performances across modalities and pave the way toward general-purpose models for automatic pain assessment.</p></details> |  |

GERM improves upon models like DNABERT-2 by eliminating outliers that hinder low-rank adaptation and post-training quantization, enhancing both efficiency and robustness. We replace the vanilla attention layer with an outlier-free mechanism inspired by associative memory models. By removing outliers during both pre-training and fine-tuning, this approach accelerates adaptation, reduces computational costs, and enhances quantization robustness within acceptable loss margins. Additionally, we propose GERM-T, a strategy that employs small-step continual learning within the outlier-free framework, leveraging original checkpoints to avoid retraining from scratch. Empirically, GERM improves fine-tuning performance by 37.98% and quantization by 64.34% over the baseline model. It also reduces average kurtosis by 92.14% and maximum infinity norm by 82.77%.

A key challenge for FedFM, given the versatile nature of foundation models, is addressing out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, where unseen tasks or clients may exhibit distribution shifts leading to suboptimal performance. Although numerous studies have explored OOD generalization in conventional FL, these methods are inadequate for FedFM due to the challenges posed by large parameter scales and increased data heterogeneity. To address these, we propose FedOA, which employs adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for efficacy and introduces personalized adapters with feature distance-based regularization to align distributions and guarantee OOD generalization for each client. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the conventional aggregated global model in FedFM inherently retains OOD generalization capabilities, and our proposed method enhances the personalized model's OOD generalization through regularization informed by the global model, with proven convergence under general non-convex settings. Empirically, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on benchmark datasets across various NLP tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpectrumFM: A Foundation Model for Intelligent Spectrum Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06256v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent spectrum management is crucial for improving spectrum efficiency and achieving secure utilization of spectrum resources. However, existing intelligent spectrum management methods, typically based on small-scale models, suffer from notable limitations in recognition accuracy, convergence speed, and generalization, particularly in the complex and dynamic spectrum environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel spectrum foundation model, termed SpectrumFM, establishing a new paradigm for spectrum management. SpectrumFM features an innovative encoder architecture that synergistically exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self-attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and enable robust representation learning. The model is pre-trained via two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, which leverage large-scale in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data to achieve comprehensive and transferable spectrum representations. Furthermore, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy is proposed to enable SpectrumFM to adapt to various downstream spectrum management tasks, including automatic modulation classification (AMC), wireless technology classification (WTC), spectrum sensing (SS), and anomaly detection (AD). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpectrumFM achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, adaptability, few-shot learning efficiency, and convergence speed, consistently outperforming conventional methods across multiple benchmarks. Specifically, SpectrumFM improves AMC accuracy by up to 12.1% and WTC accuracy by 9.3%, achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 in SS at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and enhances AD performance by over 10%.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional PINN models are typically designed for single PDEs, limiting their generalizability across different physical systems. In this work, we explore the potential of a foundation PINN model capable of solving multiple PDEs within a unified architecture. We investigate the efficacy of a single PINN framework trained on four distinct PDEs-the Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO), the 1D Heat Equation, the 1D Wave Equation, and the 2D Laplace Equation, demonstrating its ability to learn diverse physical dynamics. To enhance sample efficiency, we incorporate Active Learning (AL) using Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout-based uncertainty estimation, selecting the most informative training samples iteratively. We evaluate different active learning strategies, comparing models trained on 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% of the full dataset, and analyze their impact on solution accuracy. Our results indicate that targeted uncertainty sampling significantly improves performance with fewer training samples, leading to efficient learning across multiple PDEs. This work highlights the feasibility of a generalizable PINN-based foundation model, capable of adapting to different physics-based problems without redesigning network architectures. Our findings suggest that multi-PDE PINNs with active learning can serve as an effective approach for reducing computational costs while maintaining high accuracy in physics-based deep learning applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper should be rewritten</p></details> |
| **[Position: Foundation Models Need Digital Twin Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03798v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current foundation models (FMs) rely on token representations that directly fragment continuous real-world multimodal data into discrete tokens. They limit FMs to learning real-world knowledge and relationships purely through statistical correlation rather than leveraging explicit domain knowledge. Consequently, current FMs struggle with maintaining semantic coherence across modalities, capturing fine-grained spatial-temporal dynamics, and performing causal reasoning. These limitations cannot be overcome by simply scaling up model size or expanding datasets. This position paper argues that the machine learning community should consider digital twin (DT) representations, which are outcome-driven digital representations that serve as building blocks for creating virtual replicas of physical processes, as an alternative to the token representation for building FMs. Finally, we discuss how DT representations can address these challenges by providing physically grounded representations that explicitly encode domain knowledge and preserve the continuous nature of real-world processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Brain Foundation Models with Hypergraph Dynamic Adapter for Brain Disease Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00627v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and brain tumors, present profound challenges due to their complexity and societal impact. Recent advancements in brain foundation models have shown significant promise in addressing a range of brain-related tasks. However, current brain foundation models are limited by task and data homogeneity, restricted generalization beyond segmentation or classification, and inefficient adaptation to diverse clinical tasks. In this work, we propose SAM-Brain3D, a brain-specific foundation model trained on over 66,000 brain image-label pairs across 14 MRI sub-modalities, and Hypergraph Dynamic Adapter (HyDA), a lightweight adapter for efficient and effective downstream adaptation. SAM-Brain3D captures detailed brain-specific anatomical and modality priors for segmenting diverse brain targets and broader downstream tasks. HyDA leverages hypergraphs to fuse complementary multi-modal data and dynamically generate patient-specific convolutional kernels for multi-scale feature fusion and personalized patient-wise adaptation. Together, our framework excels across a broad spectrum of brain disease segmentation and classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, offering a new paradigm for brain disease analysis through multi-modal, multi-scale, and dynamic foundation modeling.</p></details> | 35 pages, 4 figures |
| **[PANGAEA: A Global and Inclusive Benchmark for Geospatial Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04204v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for extracting representations from Earth observation data, but their evaluation remains inconsistent and narrow. Existing works often evaluate on suboptimal downstream datasets and tasks, that are often too easy or too narrow, limiting the usefulness of the evaluations to assess the real-world applicability of GFMs. Additionally, there is a distinct lack of diversity in current evaluation protocols, which fail to account for the multiplicity of image resolutions, sensor types, and temporalities, which further complicates the assessment of GFM performance. In particular, most existing benchmarks are geographically biased towards North America and Europe, questioning the global applicability of GFMs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PANGAEA, a standardized evaluation protocol that covers a diverse set of datasets, tasks, resolutions, sensor modalities, and temporalities. It establishes a robust and widely applicable benchmark for GFMs. We evaluate the most popular GFMs openly available on this benchmark and analyze their performance across several domains. In particular, we compare these models to supervised baselines (e.g. UNet and vanilla ViT), and assess their effectiveness when faced with limited labeled data. Our findings highlight the limitations of GFMs, under different scenarios, showing that they do not consistently outperform supervised models. PANGAEA is designed to be highly extensible, allowing for the seamless inclusion of new datasets, models, and tasks in future research. By releasing the evaluation code and benchmark, we aim to enable other researchers to replicate our experiments and build upon our work, fostering a more principled evaluation protocol for large pre-trained geospatial models.

Conventional AI approaches typically rely on disjointed training, i.e., Large Language Models (LLMs) for clinical text generation and segmentation models for target extraction, which results in inflexible real-world deployment and a failure to leverage holistic biomedical information. To this end, we introduce UniBiomed, the first universal foundation model for grounded biomedical image interpretation. UniBiomed is based on a novel integration of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) and Segment Anything Model (SAM), which effectively unifies the generation of clinical texts and the segmentation of corresponding biomedical objects for grounded interpretation. In this way, UniBiomed is capable of tackling a wide range of biomedical tasks across ten diverse biomedical imaging modalities. To develop UniBiomed, we curate a large-scale dataset comprising over 27 million triplets of images, annotations, and text descriptions across ten imaging modalities. Extensive validation on 84 internal and external datasets demonstrated that UniBiomed achieves state-of-the-art performance in segmentation, disease recognition, region-aware diagnosis, visual question answering, and report generation. Moreover, unlike previous models that rely on clinical experts to pre-diagnose images and manually craft precise textual or visual prompts, UniBiomed can provide automated and end-to-end grounded interpretation for biomedical image analysis. This represents a novel paradigm shift in clinical workflows, which will significantly improve diagnostic efficiency. In summary, UniBiomed represents a novel breakthrough in biomedical AI, unlocking powerful grounded interpretation capabilities for more accurate and efficient biomedical image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first universal foundation model for grounded biomedical image interpretation</p></details> |

Our approach uses a block causal transformer architecture to model next frame predictions, leveraging previous frames as contextual priors rather than relying solely on sub-frames or pixel-based inputs commonly used in image generation methods. This block causal framework more effectively captures the spatial dependencies inherent in nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics and physical phenomena. In an ablation study, next frame prediction demonstrated a 3.5x accuracy improvement over next token prediction. BCAT is trained on a diverse range of fluid dynamics datasets, including incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations across various geometries and parameter regimes, as well as the shallow-water equations. The model's performance was evaluated on 6 distinct downstream prediction tasks and tested on about 8K trajectories to measure robustness on a variety of fluid dynamics simulations. BCAT achieved an average relative error of 1.18% across all evaluation tasks, outperforming prior approaches on standard benchmarks. With fine-tuning on a turbulence dataset, we show that the method adapts to new settings with more than 40% better accuracy over prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenAVS: Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Audio Visual Segmentation with Foundational Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01448v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-visual segmentation aims to separate sounding objects from videos by predicting pixel-level masks based on audio signals. Existing methods primarily concentrate on closed-set scenarios and direct audio-visual alignment and fusion, which limits their capability to generalize to new, unseen situations. In this paper, we propose OpenAVS, a novel training-free language-based approach that, for the first time, effectively aligns audio and visual modalities using text as a proxy for open-vocabulary Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS). Equipped with multimedia foundation models, OpenAVS directly infers masks through 1) audio-to-text prompt generation, 2) LLM-guided prompt translation, and 3) text-to-visual sounding object segmentation. The objective of OpenAVS is to establish a simple yet flexible architecture that relies on the most appropriate foundation models by fully leveraging their capabilities to enable more effective knowledge transfer to the downstream AVS task. Moreover, we present a model-agnostic framework OpenAVS-ST that enables the integration of OpenAVS with any advanced supervised AVS model via pseudo-label based self-training. This approach enhances performance by effectively utilizing large-scale unlabeled data when available. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of OpenAVS. It surpasses existing unsupervised, zero-shot, and few-shot AVS methods by a significant margin, achieving absolute performance gains of approximately 9.4% and 10.9% in mIoU and F-score, respectively, in challenging scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Wage Disparities Using Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09894v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of foundation models marks a paradigm shift in machine learning: instead of training specialized models from scratch, foundation models are first trained on massive datasets before being adapted or fine-tuned to make predictions on smaller datasets. Initially developed for text, foundation models have also excelled at making predictions about social science data. However, while many estimation problems in the social sciences use prediction as an intermediate step, they ultimately require different criteria for success. In this paper, we develop methods for fine-tuning foundation models to perform these estimation problems. We first characterize an omitted variable bias that can arise when a foundation model is only fine-tuned to maximize predictive accuracy. We then provide a novel set of conditions for fine-tuning under which estimates derived from a foundation model are root-n-consistent. Based on this theory, we develop new fine-tuning algorithms that empirically mitigate this omitted variable bias. To demonstrate our ideas, we study gender wage decomposition. This is a statistical estimation problem from econometrics where the goal is to decompose the gender wage gap into components that can and cannot be explained by career histories of workers. Classical methods for decomposing the wage gap employ simple predictive models of wages which condition on coarse summaries of career history that may omit factors that are important for explaining the gap. Instead, we use a custom-built foundation model to decompose the gender wage gap, which captures a richer representation of career history. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that career history explains more of the gender wage gap than standard econometric models can measure, and we identify elements of career history that are omitted by standard models but are important for explaining the wage gap.</p></details> |  |
| **[GLIP-OOD: Zero-Shot Graph OOD Detection with Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21186v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of machine learning systems, particularly in dynamic and open-world environments. In the vision and text domains, zero-shot OOD detection - which requires no training on in-distribution (ID) data - has made significant progress through the use of large-scale pretrained models such as vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs). However, zero-shot OOD detection in graph-structured data remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the challenges posed by complex relational structures and the absence of powerful, large-scale pretrained models for graphs. In this work, we take the first step toward enabling zero-shot graph OOD detection by leveraging a graph foundation model (GFM). We show that, when provided only with class label names, the GFM can perform OOD detection without any node-level supervision - outperforming existing supervised methods across multiple datasets. To address the more practical setting where OOD label names are unavailable, we introduce GLIP-OOD, a novel framework that employs LLMs to generate semantically informative pseudo-OOD labels from unlabeled data. These labels enable the GFM to capture nuanced semantic boundaries between ID and OOD classes and perform fine-grained OOD detection - without requiring any labeled nodes. Our approach is the first to enable node-level graph OOD detection in a fully zero-shot setting, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark text-attributed graph datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[MicroScopiQ: Accelerating Foundational Models through Outlier-Aware Microscaling Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05282v4)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization of foundational models (FMs) is significantly more challenging than traditional DNNs due to the emergence of large magnitude values called outliers. Existing outlier-aware algorithm-architecture co-design techniques either use mixed-precision, retaining outliers at high precision but compromise hardware efficiency, or quantize inliers and outliers at the same precision, improving hardware efficiency at the cost of accuracy. To address this mutual exclusivity, we propose MicroScopiQ, a novel co-design technique that leverages pruning to complement outlier-aware quantization. MicroScopiQ retains outliers at higher precision while pruning a certain fraction of least important weights to distribute the additional outlier bits; ensuring high accuracy, aligned memory and hardware efficiency. We design a high-throughput, low overhead accelerator architecture composed of multi-precision INT processing elements and a network-on-chip called ReCoN that efficiently abstracts the complexity of supporting high-precision outliers. Additionally, unlike prior techniques, MicroScopiQ does not assume any locality of outlier weights, enabling applicability to a broad range of FMs. Extensive experiments across diverse quantization settings demonstrate that MicroScopiQ achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy, while delivering up to 3x faster inference and 2x lower energy consumption compared to existing alternatives.

However, adapting these massive models to specific downstream tasks requires fine-tuning, which can be prohibitively expensive in computational resources. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by selectively updating only a small subset of parameters. Meanwhile, Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, making it ideal for privacy-sensitive applications. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the integration of PEFT techniques within federated learning environments. We systematically categorize existing approaches into three main groups: Additive PEFT (which introduces new trainable parameters), Selective PEFT (which fine-tunes only subsets of existing parameters), and Reparameterized PEFT (which transforms model architectures to enable efficient updates). For each category, we analyze how these methods address the unique challenges of federated settings, including data heterogeneity, communication efficiency, computational constraints, and privacy concerns. We further organize the literature based on application domains, covering both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. Finally, we discuss promising research directions, including scaling to larger foundation models, theoretical analysis of federated PEFT methods, and sustainable approaches for resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>surve...</summary><p>survey paper, under updating</p></details> |
| **[Verified Foundations for Differential Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01671v3)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential privacy (DP) has become the gold standard for privacy-preserving data analysis, but implementing it correctly has proven challenging. Prior work has focused on verifying DP at a high level, assuming the foundations are correct and a perfect source of randomness is available. However, the underlying theory of differential privacy can be very complex and subtle. Flaws in basic mechanisms and random number generation have been a critical source of vulnerabilities in real-world DP systems. In this paper, we present SampCert, the first comprehensive, mechanized foundation for differential privacy. SampCert is written in Lean with over 12,000 lines of proof. It offers a generic and extensible notion of DP, a framework for constructing and composing DP mechanisms, and formally verified implementations of Laplace and Gaussian sampling algorithms. SampCert provides (1) a mechanized foundation for developing the next generation of differentially private algorithms, and (2) mechanically verified primitives that can be deployed in production systems. Indeed, SampCert's verified algorithms power the DP offerings of Amazon Web Services (AWS), demonstrating its real-world impact. SampCert's key innovations include: (1) A generic DP foundation that can be instantiated for various DP definitions (e.g., pure, concentrated, R\'enyi DP); (2) formally verified discrete Laplace and Gaussian sampling algorithms that avoid the pitfalls of floating-point implementations; and (3) a simple probability monad and novel proof techniques that streamline the formalization. To enable proving complex correctness properties of DP and random number generation, SampCert makes heavy use of Lean's extensive Mathlib library, leveraging theorems in Fourier analysis, measure and probability theory, number theory, and topology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundations of Safe Online Reinforcement Learning in the Linear Quadratic Regulator: Generalized Baselines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21081v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many practical applications of online reinforcement learning require the satisfaction of safety constraints while learning about the unknown environment. In this work, we establish theoretical foundations for reinforcement learning with safety constraints by studying the canonical problem of Linear Quadratic Regulator learning with unknown dynamics, but with the additional constraint that the position must stay within a safe region for the entire trajectory with high probability. Our primary contribution is a general framework for studying stronger baselines of nonlinear controllers that are better suited for constrained problems than linear controllers. Due to the difficulty of analyzing non-linear controllers in a constrained problem, we focus on 1-dimensional state- and action- spaces, however we also discuss how we expect the high-level takeaways can generalize to higher dimensions. Using our framework, we show that for \emph{any} non-linear baseline satisfying natural assumptions, $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$-regret is possible when the noise distribution has sufficiently large support, and $\tilde{O}_T(T^{2/3})$-regret is possible for \emph{any} subgaussian noise distribution. In proving these results, we introduce a new uncertainty estimation bound for nonlinear controls which shows that enforcing safety in the presence of sufficient noise can provide ``free exploration'' that compensates for the added cost of uncertainty in safety-constrained control.</p></details> |  |
| **[If Concept Bottlenecks are the Question, are Foundation Models the Answer?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19774v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are neural networks designed to conjoin high performance with ante-hoc interpretability. CBMs work by first mapping inputs (e.g., images) to high-level concepts (e.g., visible objects and their properties) and then use these to solve a downstream task (e.g., tagging or scoring an image) in an interpretable manner. Their performance and interpretability, however, hinge on the quality of the concepts they learn. The go-to strategy for ensuring good quality concepts is to leverage expert annotations, which are expensive to collect and seldom available in applications. Researchers have recently addressed this issue by introducing "VLM-CBM" architectures that replace manual annotations with weak supervision from foundation models. It is however unclear what is the impact of doing so on the quality of the learned concepts. To answer this question, we put state-of-the-art VLM-CBMs to the test, analyzing their learned concepts empirically using a selection of significant metrics. Our results show that, depending on the task, VLM supervision can sensibly differ from expert annotations, and that concept accuracy and quality are not strongly correlated.

Remote sensing surveys complement field-based approaches, and their reach can be especially great when combined with deep learning and computer vision techniques. However, conventional supervised deep learning methods face challenges in annotating fine-grained archaeological features at scale. While recent vision foundation models have shown remarkable success in learning large-scale remote sensing data with minimal annotations, most off-the-shelf solutions are designed for RGB images rather than multi-spectral satellite imagery, such as the 8-band data used in our study. In this paper, we introduce DeepAndes, a transformer-based vision foundation model trained on three million multi-spectral satellite images, specifically tailored for Andean archaeology. DeepAndes incorporates a customized DINOv2 self-supervised learning algorithm optimized for 8-band multi-spectral imagery, marking the first foundation model designed explicitly for the Andes region. We evaluate its image understanding performance through imbalanced image classification, image instance retrieval, and pixel-level semantic segmentation tasks. Our experiments show that DeepAndes achieves superior F1 scores, mean average precision, and Dice scores in few-shot learning scenarios, significantly outperforming models trained from scratch or pre-trained on smaller datasets. This underscores the effectiveness of large-scale self-supervised pre-training in archaeological remote sensing. Codes will be available on https://github.com/geopacha/DeepAndes.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches convert sensor data into text prompts, but this process is prone to errors, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise. These challenges are particularly acute when processing extended time series data. While time series foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for learning representations from temporal data, bridging TFMs and LLMs remains challenging. Here, we present Time2Lang, a framework that directly maps TFM outputs to LLM representations without intermediate text conversion. Our approach first trains on synthetic data using periodicity prediction as a pretext task, followed by evaluation on mental health classification tasks. We validate Time2Lang on two longitudinal wearable and mobile sensing datasets: daily depression prediction using step count data (17,251 days from 256 participants) and flourishing classification based on conversation duration (46 participants over 10 weeks). Time2Lang maintains near constant inference times regardless of input length, unlike traditional prompting methods. The generated embeddings preserve essential time-series characteristics such as auto-correlation. Our results demonstrate that TFMs and LLMs can be effectively integrated while minimizing information loss and enabling performance transfer across these distinct modeling paradigms. To our knowledge, we are the first to integrate a TFM and an LLM for health, thus establishing a foundation for future research combining general-purpose large models for complex healthcare tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CHIL 2025.

Our approach enhances HOI detection by not only predicting the standard triplets but also introducing quadruplets, which extend HOI triplets by including segmentation masks for human-object pairs. More specifically, Seg2HOI inherits the properties of the vision foundation model (e.g., promptable and interactive mechanisms) and incorporates a decoder that applies these attributes to HOI task. Despite training only for HOI, without additional training mechanisms for these properties, the framework demonstrates that such features still operate efficiently. Extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate that Seg2HOI achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods, even in zero-shot scenarios. Lastly, we propose that Seg2HOI can generate HOI quadruplets and interactive HOI segmentation from novel text and visual prompts that were not used during training, making it versatile for a wide range of applications by leveraging this flexibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Foundations of Reductive Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14758v3)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of logic has largely been through the 'deductive' paradigm: conclusions are inferred from established premisses. However, the use of logic in the context of both human and machine reasoning is typically through the dual 'reductive' perspective: collections of sufficient premisses are generated from putative conclusions. We call this paradigm, 'reductive logic'. This expression of logic encompass as diverse reasoning activities as proving a formula in a formal system to seeking to meet a friend before noon on Saturday. This paper is a semantical analysis of reductive logic. In particular, we provide mathematical foundations for representing and reasoning about 'reduction operators'. Heuristically, reduction operators may be thought of as `backwards' inference rules. In this paper, we address their mathematical representation, how they are used in the context of reductive reasoning, and, crucially, what makes them 'valid'.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Multimodal Physiological Foundation Models: Handling Arbitrary Missing Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19596v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal physiological signals, such as EEG, ECG, EOG, and EMG, are crucial for healthcare and brain-computer interfaces. While existing methods rely on specialized architectures and dataset-specific fusion strategies, they struggle to learn universal representations that generalize across datasets and handle missing modalities at inference time. To address these issues, we propose PhysioOmni, a foundation model for multimodal physiological signal analysis that models both homogeneous and heterogeneous features to decouple multimodal signals and extract generic representations while maintaining compatibility with arbitrary missing modalities. PhysioOmni trains a decoupled multimodal tokenizer, enabling masked signal pre-training via modality-invariant and modality-specific objectives. To ensure adaptability to diverse and incomplete modality combinations, the pre-trained encoders undergo resilient fine-tuning with prototype alignment on downstream datasets. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks, emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, motor prediction, and mental workload detection, demonstrate that PhysioOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining strong robustness to missing modalities. Our code and model weights will be released.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Towards Faster and More Compact Foundation Models for Molecular Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19538v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in machine learning for molecular property prediction have improved accuracy but at the expense of higher computational cost and longer training times. Recently, the Joint Multi-domain Pre-training (JMP) foundation model has demonstrated strong performance across various downstream tasks with reduced training time over previous models. Despite JMP's advantages, fine-tuning it on molecular datasets ranging from small-scale to large-scale requires considerable time and computational resources. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance efficiency by reducing model size while preserving performance. To better understand the model's efficiency, we analyze the layer contributions of JMP and find that later interaction blocks provide diminishing returns, suggesting an opportunity for model compression. We explore block reduction strategies by pruning the pre-trained model and evaluating its impact on efficiency and accuracy during fine-tuning. Our analysis reveals that removing two interaction blocks results in a minimal performance drop, reducing the model size by 32% while increasing inference throughput by 1.3x. These results suggest that JMP-L is over-parameterized and that a smaller, more efficient variant can achieve comparable performance with lower computational cost. Our study provides insights for developing lighter, faster, and more scalable foundation models for molecular and materials discovery.
