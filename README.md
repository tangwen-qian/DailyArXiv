| **[LEGO: Spatial Accelerator Generation and Optimization for Tensor Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12053v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern tensor applications, especially foundation models and generative AI applications require multiple input modalities (both vision and language), which increases the demand for flexible accelerator architecture. Existing frameworks suffer from the trade-off between design flexibility and productivity of RTL generation: either limited to very few hand-written templates or cannot automatically generate the RTL. To address this challenge, we propose the LEGO framework, which targets tensor applications and automatically generates spatial architecture design and outputs synthesizable RTL code without handwritten RTL design templates. Leveraging the affine-transformation-based architecture representation, LEGO front end finds interconnections between function units, synthesizes the memory system, and fuses different spatial dataflow designs based on data reuse analysis. LEGO back end then translates the hardware in a primitive-level graph to perform lower-level optimizations, and applies a set of linear-programming algorithms to optimally insert pipeline registers and reduce the overhead of unused logic when switching spatial dataflows. Our evaluation demonstrates that LEGO can achieve 3.2x speedup and 2.4x energy efficiency compared to previous work Gemmini, and can generate one architecture for diverse modern foundation models in generative AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors have equal contributions; Published as a conference paper in HPCA 2025; 13 pages, 14 figures</p></details> |
| **[Dr.V: A Hierarchical Perception-Temporal-Cognition Framework to Diagnose Video Hallucination by Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11866v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large video models (LVMs) have significantly enhance video understanding. However, these models continue to suffer from hallucinations, producing content that conflicts with input videos. To address this issue, we propose Dr.V, a hierarchical framework covering perceptive, temporal, and cognitive levels to diagnose video hallucination by fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding. Dr.V comprises of two key components: a benchmark dataset Dr.V-Bench and a satellite video agent Dr.V-Agent. Dr.V-Bench includes 10k instances drawn from 4,974 videos spanning diverse tasks, each enriched with detailed spatial-temporal annotation. Dr.V-Agent detects hallucinations in LVMs by systematically applying fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding at the perceptive and temporal levels, followed by cognitive level reasoning. This step-by-step pipeline mirrors human-like video comprehension and effectively identifies hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dr.V-Agent is effective in diagnosing hallucination while enhancing interpretability and reliability, offering a practical blueprint for robust video understanding in real-world scenarios. All our data and code are available at https://github.com/Eurekaleo/Dr.V.</p></details> | 25 pages, 16 figures |

Although SA-UNet introduces spatial attention in the bottleneck, it underuses attention in skip connections and does not address the severe foreground-background imbalance. We propose SA-UNetv2, a lightweight model that injects cross-scale spatial attention into all skip connections to strengthen multi-scale feature fusion and adopts a weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) plus Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) loss to improve robustness to class imbalance. On the public DRIVE and STARE datasets, SA-UNetv2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1.2MB memory and 0.26M parameters (less than 50% of SA-UNet), and 1 second CPU inference on 592 x 592 x 3 images, demonstrating strong efficiency and deployability in resource-constrained, CPU-only settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at github.com/clguo/SA-UNetv2</p></details> |
| **[On Spatial-Provenance Recovery in Wireless Networks with Relaxed-Privacy Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11761v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks with multi-hop communication, Road Side Units (RSUs) intend to gather location data from the vehicles to offer various location-based services. Although vehicles use the Global Positioning System (GPS) for navigation, they may refrain from sharing their exact GPS coordinates to the RSUs due to privacy considerations. Thus, to address the localization expectations of the RSUs and the privacy concerns of the vehicles, we introduce a relaxed-privacy model wherein the vehicles share their partial location information in order to avail the location-based services. To implement this notion of relaxed-privacy, we propose a low-latency protocol for spatial-provenance recovery, wherein vehicles use correlated linear Bloom filters to embed their position information. Our proposed spatial-provenance recovery process takes into account the resolution of localization, the underlying ad hoc protocol, and the coverage range of the wireless technology used by the vehicles. Through a rigorous theoretical analysis, we present extensive analysis on the underlying trade-off between relaxed-privacy and the communication-overhead of the protocol. Finally, using a wireless testbed, we show that our proposed method requires a few bits in the packet header to provide security features such as localizing a low-power jammer executing a denial-of-service attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, September 2025</p></details> |
| **[SCP-Diff: Spatial-Categorical Joint Prior for Diffusion Based Semantic Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09638v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic image synthesis (SIS) shows good promises for sensor simulation. However, current best practices in this field, based on GANs, have not yet reached the desired level of quality. As latent diffusion models make significant strides in image generation, we are prompted to evaluate ControlNet, a notable method for its dense control capabilities. Our investigation uncovered two primary issues with its results: the presence of weird sub-structures within large semantic areas and the misalignment of content with the semantic mask. Through empirical study, we pinpointed the cause of these problems as a mismatch between the noised training data distribution and the standard normal prior applied at the inference stage. To address this challenge, we developed specific noise priors for SIS, encompassing spatial, categorical, and a novel spatial-categorical joint prior for inference. This approach, which we have named SCP-Diff, has set new state-of-the-art results in SIS on Cityscapes, ADE20K and COCO-Stuff, yielding a FID as low as 10.53 on Cityscapes. The code and models can be accessed via the project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://air-discover.github.io/SCP-Diff/</p></details> |
| **[Geometrically Constrained and Token-Based Probabilistic Spatial Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11218v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) remains highly sensitive to geometric variability, where objects appear under arbitrary orientations, scales, and perspective distortions. While equivariant architectures address this issue, they typically require substantial computational resources and restrict the hypothesis space. We revisit Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) as a canonicalization tool for transformer-based vision pipelines, emphasizing their flexibility, backbone-agnostic nature, and lack of architectural constraints. We propose a probabilistic, component-wise extension that improves robustness. Specifically, we decompose affine transformations into rotation, scaling, and shearing, and regress each component under geometric constraints using a shared localization encoder. To capture uncertainty, we model each component with a Gaussian variational posterior and perform sampling-based canonicalization during inference.A novel component-wise alignment loss leverages augmentation parameters to guide spatial alignment. Experiments on challenging moth classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently improves robustness compared to other STNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAMP: Spatial Anchor-based Motion Policy for Collision-Aware Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11185v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural-based motion planning methods have achieved remarkable progress for robotic manipulators, yet a fundamental challenge lies in simultaneously accounting for both the robot's physical shape and the surrounding environment when generating safe and feasible motions. Moreover, existing approaches often rely on simplified robot models or focus primarily on obstacle representation, which can lead to incomplete collision detection and degraded performance in cluttered scenes. To address these limitations, we propose spatial anchor-based motion policy (SAMP), a unified framework that simultaneously encodes the environment and the manipulator using signed distance field (SDF) anchored on a shared spatial grid. SAMP incorporates a dedicated robot SDF network that captures the manipulator's precise geometry, enabling collision-aware reasoning beyond coarse link approximations. These representations are fused on spatial anchors and used to train a neural motion policy that generates smooth, collision-free trajectories in the proposed efficient feature alignment strategy. Experiments conducted in both simulated and real-world environments consistently show that SAMP outperforms existing methods, delivering an 11% increase in success rate and a 7% reduction in collision rate. These results highlight the benefits of jointly modelling robot and environment geometry, demonstrating its practical value in challenging real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[STASE: A spatialized text-to-audio synthesis engine for music generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11124v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While many text-to-audio systems produce monophonic or fixed-stereo outputs, generating audio with user-defined spatial properties remains a challenge. Existing deep learning-based spatialization methods often rely on latent-space manipulations, which can limit direct control over psychoacoustic parameters critical to spatial perception. To address this, we introduce STASE, a system that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as an agent to interpret spatial cues from text. A key feature of STASE is the decoupling of semantic interpretation from a separate, physics-based spatial rendering engine, which facilitates interpretable and user-controllable spatial reasoning. The LLM processes prompts through two main pathways: (i) Description Prompts, for direct mapping of explicit spatial information (e.g., "place the lead guitar at 45{\deg} azimuth, 10 m distance"), and (ii) Abstract Prompts, where a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module retrieves relevant spatial templates to inform the rendering. This paper details the STASE workflow, discusses implementation considerations, and highlights current challenges in evaluating generative spatial audio.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to LLM4Music @ ISMIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[SVR-GS: Spatially Variant Regularization for Probabilistic Masks in 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11116v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables fast, high-quality novel view synthesis but typically relies on densification followed by pruning to optimize the number of Gaussians. Existing mask-based pruning, such as MaskGS, regularizes the global mean of the mask, which is misaligned with the local per-pixel (per-ray) reconstruction loss that determines image quality along individual camera rays. This paper introduces SVR-GS, a spatially variant regularizer that renders a per-pixel spatial mask from each Gaussian's effective contribution along the ray, thereby applying sparsity pressure where it matters: on low-importance Gaussians. We explore three spatial-mask aggregation strategies, implement them in CUDA, and conduct a gradient analysis to motivate our final design. Extensive experiments on Tanks\&Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that, on average across the three datasets, the proposed SVR-GS reduces the number of Gaussians by 1.79\(\times\) compared to MaskGS and 5.63\(\times\) compared to 3DGS, while incurring only 0.50 dB and 0.40 dB PSNR drops, respectively. These gains translate into significantly smaller, faster, and more memory-efficient models, making them well-suited for real-time applications such as robotics, AR/VR, and mobile perception.</p></details> |  |
| **[BIGNet: Pretrained Graph Neural Network for Embedding Semantic, Spatial, and Topological Data in BIM Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11104v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Foundation Models (LFMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in civil engineering, but they primarily focus on textual and visual data, overlooking the rich semantic, spatial, and topological features in BIM (Building Information Modelling) models. Therefore, this study develops the first large-scale graph neural network (GNN), BIGNet, to learn, and reuse multidimensional design features embedded in BIM models. Firstly, a scalable graph representation is introduced to encode the "semantic-spatial-topological" features of BIM components, and a dataset with nearly 1 million nodes and 3.5 million edges is created. Subsequently, BIGNet is proposed by introducing a new message-passing mechanism to GraphMAE2 and further pretrained with a node masking strategy. Finally, BIGNet is evaluated in various transfer learning tasks for BIM-based design checking. Results show that: 1) homogeneous graph representation outperforms heterogeneous graph in learning design features, 2) considering local spatial relationships in a 30 cm radius enhances performance, and 3) BIGNet with GAT (Graph Attention Network)-based feature extraction achieves the best transfer learning results. This innovation leads to a 72.7% improvement in Average F1-score over non-pretrained models, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning and transferring BIM design features and facilitating their automated application in future design and lifecycle management.</p></details> |  |
| **[GCN-TULHOR: Trajectory-User Linking Leveraging GCNs and Higher-Order Spatial Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11095v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory-user linking (TUL) aims to associate anonymized trajectories with the users who generated them, which is crucial for personalized recommendations, privacy-preserving analytics, and secure location-based services. Existing methods struggle with sparse data, incomplete routes, and limited modeling of complex spatial dependencies, often relying on low-level check-in data or ignoring spatial patterns. In this paper, we introduced GCN-TULHOR, a method that transforms raw location data into higher-order mobility flow representations using hexagonal tessellation, reducing data sparsity and capturing richer spatial semantics, and integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Our approach converts both sparse check-in and continuous GPS trajectory data into unified higher-order flow representations, mitigating sparsity while capturing deeper semantic information. The GCN layer explicitly models complex spatial relationships and non-local dependencies without requiring side information such as timestamps or points of interest. Experiments on six real-world datasets show consistent improvements over classical baselines, RNN- and Transformer-based models, and the TULHOR method in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. GCN-TULHOR achieves 1-8% relative gains in accuracy and F1. Sensitivity analysis identifies an optimal setup with a single GCN layer and 512-dimensional embeddings. The integration of GCNs enhances spatial learning and improves generalizability across mobility data. This work highlights the value of combining graph-based spatial learning with sequential modeling, offering a robust and scalable solution for TUL with applications in recommendations, urban planning, and security.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal message passing for molecular prediction is simple, attentive and spatial](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10871v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strategies to improve the predicting performance of Message-Passing Neural-Networks for molecular property predictions can be achieved by simplifying how the message is passed and by using descriptors that capture multiple aspects of molecular graphs. In this work, we designed model architectures that achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing more complex models such as those pre-trained on external databases. We assessed dataset diversity to complement our performance results, finding that structural diversity influences the need for additional components in our MPNNs and feature sets. In most datasets, our best architecture employs bidirectional message-passing with an attention mechanism, applied to a minimalist message formulation that excludes self-perception, highlighting that relatively simpler models, compared to classical MPNNs, yield higher class separability. In contrast, we found that convolution normalization factors do not benefit the predictive power in all the datasets tested. This was corroborated in both global and node-level outputs. Additionally, we analyzed the influence of both adding spatial features and working with 3D graphs, finding that 2D molecular graphs are sufficient when complemented with appropriately chosen 3D descriptors. This approach not only preserves predictive performance but also reduces computational cost by over 50%, making it particularly advantageous for high-throughput screening campaigns.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 12 figures.

| **[Spatial Modeling and Risk Zoning of Global Extreme Precipitation via Graph Neural Networks and r-Pareto Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10362v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme precipitation events occurring over large spatial domains pose substantial threats to societies because they can trigger compound flooding, landslides, and infrastructure failures across wide areas. A hybrid framework for spatial extreme precipitation modeling and risk zoning is proposed that integrates graph neural networks with r-Pareto processes (GNN-rP). Unlike traditional statistical spatial extremes models, this approach learns nonlinear, nonstationary dependence structures from precipitation-derived spatial graphs and applies a data-driven tail functional to model joint exceedances in a low-dimensional embedding space. Using NASA's IMERG observations (2000-2021) and CMIP6 SSP5-8.5 projections, the framework delineates coherent high-risk zones, quantifies their temporal persistence, and detects emerging hotspots under climate change. Compared with two baseline approaches, the GNN-rP pipeline substantially improves pointwise detection of high-risk grid cells while yielding comparable clustering stability. Results highlight persistent high-risk regions in the tropical belt, especially monsoon and convective zones, and reveal decadal-scale persistence that is punctuated by episodic reconfigurations under high-emission scenarios. By coupling machine learning with extreme value theory, GNN-rP offers a scalable, interpretable tool for adaptive climate risk zoning, with direct applications in infrastructure planning, disaster preparedness, and climate-resilient policy design.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Kriging prior Regression: A Case for Kriging-Based Spatial Features with TabPFN in Soil Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09408v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning and geostatistics are two fundamentally different frameworks for predicting and spatially mapping soil properties. Geostatistics leverages the spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the relationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We propose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through engineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this approach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of regression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and probabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six fieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon, clay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and in-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable uncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several other spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as well as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30% compared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This improvement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN algorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR features. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small sample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for weak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal soil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a very robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in precision agriculture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Space-Time Tradeoffs for Spatial Conjunctive Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10050v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a conjunctive query and a database instance, we aim to develop an index that can efficiently answer spatial queries on the results of a conjunctive query. We are interested in some commonly used spatial queries, such as range emptiness, range count, and nearest neighbor queries. These queries have essential applications in data analytics, such as filtering relational data based on attribute ranges and temporal graph analysis for counting graph structures like stars, paths, and cliques. Furthermore, this line of research can accelerate relational algorithms that incorporate spatial queries in their workflow, such as relational clustering. Known approaches either have to spend $\tilde{O}(N)$ query time or use space as large as the number of query results, which are inefficient or unrealistic to employ in practice. Hence, we aim to construct an index that answers spatial conjunctive queries in both time- and space-efficient ways. In this paper, we establish lower bounds on the tradeoff between answering time and space usage. For $k$-star (resp. $k$-path) queries, we show that any index for range emptiness, range counting or nearest neighbor queries with $T$ answering time requires $\Omega\left(N+\frac{N^k}{T^k}\right)$ (resp. $\Omega\left(N+\frac{N^2}{T^{2/(k-1)}}\right)$) space. Then, we construct optimal indexes for answering range emptiness and range counting problems over $k$-star and $k$-path queries. Extending this result, we build an index for hierarchical queries. By resorting to the generalized hypertree decomposition, we can extend our index to arbitrary conjunctive queries for supporting spatial conjunctive queries. Finally, we show how our new indexes can be used to improve the running time of known algorithms in the relational setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Engineering Spatial and Molecular Features from Cellular Niches to Inform Predictions of Inflammatory Bowel Disease](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09923v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiating between the two main subtypes of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): Crohns disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is a persistent clinical challenge due to overlapping presentations. This study introduces a novel computational framework that employs spatial transcriptomics (ST) to create an explainable machine learning model for IBD classification. We analyzed ST data from the colonic mucosa of healthy controls (HC), UC, and CD patients. Using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), we first identified four recurring cellular niches, representing distinct functional microenvironments within the tissue. From these niches, we systematically engineered 44 features capturing three key aspects of tissue pathology: niche composition, neighborhood enrichment, and niche-gene signals. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier trained on these features achieved an accuracy of 0.774 +/- 0.161 for the more challenging three-class problem (HC, UC, and CD) and 0.916 +/- 0.118 in the two-class problem of distinguishing IBD from healthy tissue. Crucially, model explainability analysis revealed that disruptions in the spatial organization of niches were the strongest predictors of general inflammation, while the classification between UC and CD relied on specific niche-gene expression signatures. This work provides a robust, proof-of-concept pipeline that transforms descriptive spatial data into an accurate and explainable predictive tool, offering not only a potential new diagnostic paradigm but also deeper insights into the distinct biological mechanisms that drive IBD subtypes.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables.

| **[SpatialVID: A Large-Scale Video Dataset with Spatial Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09676v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale, diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes, camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses, depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured captions, and serialized motion instructions. Analysis of SpatialVID's data statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video and 3D vision research community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://nju-3dv.github.io/projects/SpatialVID/</p></details> |
| **[Region-Specific Audio Tagging for Spatial Sound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09526v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio tagging aims to label sound events appearing in an audio recording. In this paper, we propose region-specific audio tagging, a new task which labels sound events in a given region for spatial audio recorded by a microphone array. The region can be specified as an angular space or a distance from the microphone. We first study the performance of different combinations of spectral, spatial, and position features. Then we extend state-of-the-art audio tagging systems such as pre-trained audio neural networks (PANNs) and audio spectrogram transformer (AST) to the proposed region-specific audio tagging task. Experimental results on both the simulated and the real datasets show the feasibility of the proposed task and the effectiveness of the proposed method. Further experiments show that incorporating the directional features is beneficial for omnidirectional tagging.</p></details> | DCASE2025 Workshop |
| **[Short-term cognitive fatigue of spatial selective attention after face-to-face conversations in virtual noisy environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09479v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial selective attention is an important asset for communication in cocktail party situations but may be compromised by short-term cognitive fatigue. Here we tested whether an effortful conversation in a highly ecological setting depletes task performance in an auditory spatial selective attention task. Young participants with normal hearing performed the task before and after (1) having a real dyadic face-to-face conversation on a free topic in a virtual reverberant room with simulated interfering conversations and background babble noise at 72 dB SPL for 30 minutes, (2) passively listening to the interfering conversations and babble noise, or (3) having the conversation in quiet. Self-reported perceived effort and fatigue increased after conversations in noise and passive listening relative to the reports after conversations in quiet. In contrast to our expectations, response times in the attention task decreased, rather than increased, after conversation in noise and accuracy did not change systematically in any of the conditions on the group level. Unexpectedly, we observed strong training effects between the individual sessions in our within-subject design even after one hour of training on a different day.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring Implicit Spatial Coordination in Teams: Effects on Collective Intelligence and Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09314v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated teamwork is essential in fast-paced decision-making environments that require dynamic adaptation, often without an opportunity for explicit communication. Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered in the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located, synchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily on coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military, law enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in physical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit communication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial coordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and adaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative online search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and team members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and coordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements within shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136 participants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task. Results show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while adaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship, suggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over time. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in role-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive strategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[The role of communication delays in the optimal control of spatially invariant systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09269v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study optimal proportional feedback controllers for spatially invariant systems when the controller has access to delayed state measurements received from different spatial locations. We analyze how delays affect the spatial locality of the optimal feedback gain leveraging the problem decoupling in the spatial frequency domain. For the cases of expensive control and small delay, we provide exact expressions of the optimal controllers in the limit for infinite control weight and vanishing delay, respectively. In the expensive control regime, the optimal feedback control law decomposes into a delay-aware filtering of the delayed state and the optimal controller in the delay-free setting. Under small delays, the optimal controller is a perturbation of the delay-free one which depends linearly on the delay. We illustrate our analytical findings with a reaction-diffusion process over the real line and a multi-agent system coupled through circulant matrices, showing that delays reduce the effectiveness of optimal feedback control and may require each subsystem within a distributed implementation to communicate with farther-away locations.</p></details> | <details><summary>{\cop...</summary><p>{\copyright} 2025 IEEE.

| **[Mind Meets Space: Rethinking Agentic Spatial Intelligence from a Neuroscience-inspired Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09154v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments. Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end, we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning. Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics.

| **[ADHDeepNet From Raw EEG to Diagnosis: Improving ADHD Diagnosis through Temporal-Spatial Processing, Adaptive Attention Mechanisms, and Explainability in Raw EEG Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08779v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in children that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and career life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients and the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls), employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy. Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner 2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation. ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 7 figures. Preprint.

| **[Unified calibration and spatial mapping of fine particulate matter data from multiple low-cost air pollution sensor networks in Baltimore, Maryland](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13034v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-cost air pollution sensor networks are increasingly being deployed globally, supplementing sparse regulatory monitoring with localized air quality data. In some areas, like Baltimore, Maryland, there are only few regulatory (reference) devices but multiple low-cost networks. While there are many available methods to calibrate data from each network individually, separate calibration of each network leads to conflicting air quality predictions. We develop a general Bayesian spatial filtering model combining data from multiple networks and reference devices, providing dynamic calibrations (informed by the latest reference data) and unified predictions (combining information from all available sensors) for the entire region. This method accounts for network-specific bias and noise (observation models), as different networks can use different types of sensors, and uses a Gaussian process (state-space model) to capture spatial correlations. We apply the method to calibrate PM$_{2.5}$ data from Baltimore in June and July 2023 -- a period including days of hazardous concentrations due to wildfire smoke. Our method helps mitigate the effects of preferential sampling of one network in Baltimore, results in better predictions and narrower confidence intervals. Our approach can be used to calibrate low-cost air pollution sensor data in Baltimore and any other areas with multiple low-cost networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MSNav: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Dynamic Memory and LLM Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16654v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM) makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities, including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module, a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition; and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space (I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp), which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL).</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Attribute-based Object Grounding and Robot Grasp Detection with Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08126v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robots to grasp objects specified through natural language is essential for effective human-robot interaction, yet it remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often struggle with open-form language expressions and typically assume unambiguous target objects without duplicates. Moreover, they frequently rely on costly, dense pixel-wise annotations for both object grounding and grasp configuration. We present Attribute-based Object Grounding and Robotic Grasping (OGRG), a novel framework that interprets open-form language expressions and performs spatial reasoning to ground target objects and predict planar grasp poses, even in scenes containing duplicated object instances. We investigate OGRG in two settings: (1) Referring Grasp Synthesis (RGS) under pixel-wise full supervision, and (2) Referring Grasp Affordance (RGA) using weakly supervised learning with only single-pixel grasp annotations. Key contributions include a bi-directional vision-language fusion module and the integration of depth information to enhance geometric reasoning, improving both grounding and grasping performance. Experiment results show that OGRG outperforms strong baselines in tabletop scenes with diverse spatial language instructions. In RGS, it operates at 17.59 FPS on a single NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti GPU, enabling potential use in closed-loop or multi-object sequential grasping, while delivering superior grounding and grasp prediction accuracy compared to all the baselines considered. Under the weakly supervised RGA setting, OGRG also surpasses baseline grasp-success rates in both simulation and real-robot trials, underscoring the effectiveness of its spatial reasoning design.

| **[MSRFormer: Road Network Representation Learning using Multi-scale Feature Fusion of Heterogeneous Spatial Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05685v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer, MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections, which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow heterogeneity of spatial interactions.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces dciWebMapper2, a significant expansion of the original dciWebMapper framework, designed to enable exploratory analysis across domains such as climate justice, food access, and social vulnerability. The enhanced framework integrates multiple map types, including choropleth, proportional symbol, small multiples, and heatmaps, with linked statistical charts (e.g., scatter plots, boxplots) and time sliders, all within a coordinated-view environment. Dropdown-based controls allow flexible, high-dimensional comparisons while maintaining visual clarity. Grounded in cartographic and information visualization principles, dciWebMapper2 is fully open-source, self-contained, and server-free, supporting modularity, reproducibility, and long-term sustainability. Three applied use cases demonstrate its adaptability and potential to democratize interactive web cartography.

| **[Universal Few-Shot Spatial Control for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07530v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation, we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks, achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably, when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is available at https://github.com/kietngt00/UFC.</p></details> |  |

Particularly spatial health data are becoming increasingly important for medical research, for example, to better understand relationships between environmental factors and disease patterns. However, their use is often restricted by legal data protection regulations, since georeferenced personal information carries a high risk of re-identification of individuals. To address this issue, what are called geomasking methods are applied to guarantee data protection through targeted displacement of individual data points, while simultaneously maintaining analytical validity within a tolerable range. In the current literature the degree of anonymity of such anonymized georeferenced datasets is often measured by the so-called metric of spatial k-anonymity. However, this metric has considerable shortcomings, particularly regarding its resilience against realistic data attack scenarios. This article classifies the potential data attack scenarios in the context of anonymized georeferenced microdata and introduces appropriate metrics that enable a comprehensive assessment of anonymity adapted to potential data attack scenarios.</p></details> | 16 pages, 2 figures |

We devise nonparametric Bayesian procedures with Besov-Laplace priors, which are prior distributions on function spaces routinely used in imaging and inverse problems in view of their useful edge-preserving and sparsity-promoting properties. Building on a recent line of work in the literature, we investigate the theoretical asymptotic recovery properties of the associated posterior distributions, and show that suitably tuned Besov-Laplace priors lead to minimax-optimal posterior contraction rates as the sample size increases, under the frequentist assumption that the data have been generated by a spatially inhomogeneous ground truth belonging to a Besov space.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, to appear in Supervised and Unsupervised Statistical Data Analysis (CLADAG-VOC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Learning spatially structured open quantum dynamics with regional-attention transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06871v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems with spatial structure and external control is an important challenge in quantum information science. Classical numerical solvers for such systems require integrating coupled master and field equations, which is computationally demanding for simulation and optimization tasks and often precluding real-time use in network-scale simulations or feedback control. We introduce a regional attention-based neural architecture that learns the spatiotemporal dynamics of structured open quantum systems. The model incorporates translational invariance of physical laws as an inductive bias to achieve scalable complexity, and supports conditioning on time-dependent global control parameters. We demonstrate learning on two representative systems: a driven dissipative single qubit and an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) quantum memory. The model achieves high predictive fidelity under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution control protocols, and provides substantial acceleration up to three orders of magnitude over numerical solvers. These results demonstrate that the architecture establishes a general surrogate modeling framework for spatially structured open quantum dynamics, with immediate relevance to large-scale quantum network simulation, quantum repeater and protocol design, real-time experimental optimization, and scalable device modeling across diverse light-matter platforms.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Adversarial Obstacle Placement with Spatial Point Processes for Optimal Path Disruption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06837v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the Optimal Obstacle Placement (OOP) problem under uncertainty, framed as the dual of the Optimal Traversal Path problem in the Stochastic Obstacle Scene paradigm. We consider both continuous domains, discretized for analysis, and already discrete spatial grids that form weighted geospatial networks using 8-adjacency lattices. Our unified framework integrates OOP with stochastic geometry, modeling obstacle placement via Strauss (regular) and Mat\'ern (clustered) processes, and evaluates traversal using the Reset Disambiguation algorithm. Through extensive Monte Carlo experiments, we show that traversal cost increases by up to 40% under strongly regular placements, while clustered configurations can decrease traversal costs by as much as 25% by leaving navigable corridors compared to uniform random layouts. In mixed (with both true and false obstacles) scenarios, increasing the proportion of true obstacles from 30% to 70% nearly doubles the traversal cost. These findings are further supported by statistical analysis and stochastic ordering, providing rigorous insights into how spatial patterns and obstacle compositions influence navigation under uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Spatial and Semantic Embeddings for Stereo Sound Event Localization in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06598v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we address the multimodal task of stereo sound event localization and detection with source distance estimation (3D SELD) in regular video content. 3D SELD is a complex task that combines temporal event classification with spatial localization, requiring reasoning across spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. The last is arguably the most challenging to model. Traditional SELD approaches typically rely on multichannel input, limiting their capacity to benefit from large-scale pre-training due to data constraints. To overcome this, we enhance a standard SELD architecture with semantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned models: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are incorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion, which we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. We perform an ablation study on the development set of the DCASE2025 Task3 Stereo SELD Dataset to assess the individual contributions of the language-aligned models and benchmark against the DCASE Task 3 baseline systems. Additionally, we detail the curation process of large synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets used for model pre-training. These datasets were further expanded through left-right channel swapping augmentation. Our approach, combining extensive pre-training, model ensembling, and visual post-processing, achieved second rank in the DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 3 (Track B), underscoring the effectiveness of our method. Future work will explore the modality-specific contributions and architectural refinements.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2507.04845</p></details> |

We prove that if the involved operators are domain-uniformly stabilizable and detectable, then these localized perturbations only have a local effect on the optimal solution. We characterize this domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability for the transport equation with constant transport velocity, showing that even for unitary semigroups, optimality implies exponential damping. We extend this result to the case of a space-dependent transport velocity. Finally we leverage the results for the transport equation to characterize domain-uniform stabilizability of the wave equation. Numerical examples in one space dimension complement the theoretical results.</p></details> | 53 pages, 5 figures |
| **[FSG-Net: Frequency-Spatial Synergistic Gated Network for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Change Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06482v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g., illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries. To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations. Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components. Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers. Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS). 13 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we leverage large-scale high-quality 3D scene data with open-set annotations to introduce 1) a novel supervised fine-tuning dataset and 2) a new evaluation benchmark, focused on indoor scenes. Our Cubify Anything VQA (CA-VQA) data covers diverse spatial tasks including spatial relationship prediction, metric size and distance estimation, and 3D grounding. We show that CA-VQA enables us to train MM-Spatial, a strong generalist MLLM that also achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D spatial understanding benchmarks, including our own. We show how incorporating metric depth and multi-view inputs (provided in CA-VQA) can further improve 3D understanding, and demonstrate that data alone allows our model to achieve depth perception capabilities comparable to dedicated monocular depth estimation models.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[MCTuner: Spatial Decomposition-Enhanced Database Tuning via LLM-Guided Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06298v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Database knob tuning is essential for optimizing the performance of modern database management systems, which often expose hundreds of knobs with continuous or categorical values. However, the large number of knobs and the vast configuration space make it difficult to identify optimal settings efficiently. Although learning-based tuning has shown promise, existing approaches either ignore domain knowledge by relying solely on benchmark feedback or struggle to explore the high-dimensional knob space, resulting in high tuning costs and suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose MCTuner, an adaptive knob tuning framework that minimizes exploration in ineffective regions of the configuration space. MCTuner employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism with specialized LLMs to identify performance-critical knobs. In further, MCTuner introduces the first spatial decomposition algorithm that recursively partitions the space into hierarchical subspaces, on which Bayesian Optimization is performed to efficiently search for near-optimal configurations. Evaluated on different benchmarks (OLAP, OLTP, and HTAP), MCTuner achieves up to 19.2% performance gains and 1.4x faster configuration discovery per iteration compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Prior work has addressed this issue by creating spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data. Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view environments.</p></details> |  |

Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore, existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components: (1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively, surpassing existing methods by significant margins.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment, fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both pose accuracy and robustness.

We propose a model selection method for the multivariate spatial autoregressive model, when the true spatial weights matrix may not be in the candidates. We show that the selected estimator is asymptotically optimal in the sense of minimizing the squared loss. If the candidate set contains the true spatial weights matrix, the method has selection consistency. We further propose a model averaging estimator that combines a set of candidate models and show its asymptotic optimality. Monte Carlo simulation results indicate that the proposed model selection and model averaging estimators perform quite well in finite samples. The proposed methods are applied to a Sina Weibo data to reveal how the user's posting behavior is influenced by the users that he follows. The analysis results indicate that the influence tends to be uniformly distributed among the user's followee, or linearly correlated with the number of followers of the followee.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Aware Self-Supervision for Medical 3D Imaging with Multi-Granularity Observable Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05967v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging. Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies, while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning process.</p></details> |  |

The graph bandit problem extends the MAB setting by introducing spatial constraints, yet quantum approaches remain limited. We propose a quantum algorithm for best-arm identification in graph bandits, termed Quantum Spatial Best-Arm Identification (QSBAI). The method employs quantum walks to encode superpositions over graph-constrained actions, extending amplitude amplification and generalizing the Quantum BAI algorithm via Szegedy's walk framework. This establishes a link between Grover-type search and reinforcement learning tasks with structural restrictions. We analyze complete and bipartite graphs, deriving the maximal success probability of identifying the best arm and the time step at which it is achieved. Our results highlight the potential of quantum walks to accelerate exploration in constrained environments and extend the applicability of quantum algorithms for decision-making.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

To this end, we present GeoAnalystBench, a benchmark of 50 Python-based tasks derived from real-world geospatial problems and carefully validated by GIS experts. Each task is paired with a minimum deliverable product, and evaluation covers workflow validity, structural alignment, semantic similarity, and code quality (CodeBLEU). Using this benchmark, we assess both proprietary and open source models. Results reveal a clear gap: proprietary models such as ChatGPT-4o-mini achieve high validity 95% and stronger code alignment (CodeBLEU 0.39), while smaller open source models like DeepSeek-R1-7B often generate incomplete or inconsistent workflows (48.5% validity, 0.272 CodeBLEU). Tasks requiring deeper spatial reasoning, such as spatial relationship detection or optimal site selection, remain the most challenging across all models. These findings demonstrate both the promise and limitations of current LLMs in GIS automation and provide a reproducible framework to advance GeoAI research with human-in-the-loop support.</p></details> | 34 pages, 8 figures |

Traditionally, this task relies on experienced clinicians to manually annotate data, a process that is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, deep learning methods have shown promise in automating this task. However, three major challenges remain: (1) deep learning models typically require large-scale labeled datasets, making them less effective in real-world settings where annotated data is limited; (2) significant inter-individual variability in bio-signals often results in inconsistent model performance when applied to new subjects, limiting generalization; and (3) existing approaches often overlook the high-order relationships among bio-signals, failing to simultaneously capture signal heterogeneity and spatial-temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose MetaSTH-Sleep, a few-shot sleep stage classification framework based on spatial-temporal hypergraph enhanced meta-learning. Our approach enables rapid adaptation to new subjects using only a few labeled samples, while the hypergraph structure effectively models complex spatial interconnections and temporal dynamics simultaneously in EEG signals. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaSTH-Sleep achieves substantial performance improvements across diverse subjects, offering valuable insights to support clinicians in sleep stage annotation.</p></details> |  |

In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual spider monkey core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. Sets of individuals with complementary overlaps are identified, showing a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions, and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures plus supplementary information with 15 pages, methods, model and 9 figures of results</p></details> |

However, some data have a complex spatial structure that cannot be adequately described with the physical distance alone. In this work, the spatial failure-time data of focus contains information on GPUs that are connected through a network fabric topology that differs from their physical layout and that is expected to introduce additional correlations. The proposed lifetime regression model includes random effects capturing the dependency due to physical location as well as random effects explaining the dependency due to logical connections between GPUs. The analysis of this GPU dataset serves as an example of models with multiple spatial random effects and the ideas presented can be extended to other applications with complex spatial structures. A Bayesian modeling scheme is recommended for this class of analyses. The examples in this work use the software package, Stan, to produce Markov chain Monte Carlo draws for parameter estimation. This modeling effort is validated through simulation which demonstrates accuracy in statistical inference. We also apply the developed framework to the large-scale Titan GPU failure time data.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |

This report introduces a forgery detection framework that combines spatial and frequency-based features for detecting forgeries. We propose a dual branch convolution neural network that operates on features extracted from spatial and frequency domains. Features from both branches are fused and compared within a Siamese network, yielding 64 dimensional embeddings for classification. When benchmarked on CASIA 2.0 dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 77.9%, outperforming traditional statistical methods. Despite its relatively weaker performance compared to larger, more complex forgery detection pipelines, our approach balances computational complexity and detection reliability, making it ready for practical deployment. It provides a strong methodology for forensic scrutiny of digital images. In a broader sense, it advances the state of the art in visual forensics, addressing an urgent requirement in media verification, law enforcement and digital content reliability.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS) strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations. Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word and synthetic LF datasets.</p></details> |  |

Effective cloud detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of Applied Remote Sensing</p></details> |

However, inference for ILMs is computationally intensive, especially as the total population size increases and additional covariates are incorporated. We propose a composite method, the composite ILM (C-ILM), that clusters the population into minimally-interfered subpopulations, with between-cluster infections enabled through a ``spark function.'' This approach allows for parallel computation of subsets before aggregation. Focusing on C-ILM, we consider four ``spark functions'', and introduce a Dirichlet process mixture modelling (DPMM) algorithm for clustering. Simulation results indicate that, in addition to faster computation, C-ILM performs well in parameter estimation and posterior predictions. Furthermore, within C-ILM framework, DPMM algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to the conventional $K$-means algorithm. We apply the methods to data from the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. The results provide evidence that C-ILM is not only computationally efficient but also achieves a better model fit compared to the basic spatial ILM.</p></details> |  |

It is comprised of entirely new real-world image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order of objects. The benchmark is designed to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not object localization capabilities. We release the dataset with a CC-BY-4.0 license and make the evaluation code available at: https://github.com/nilshoehing/rocketscience</p></details> |  |
| **[Completing Spatial Transcriptomics Data for Gene Expression Prediction Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02980v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Transcriptomics is a groundbreaking technology that integrates histology images with spatially resolved gene expression profiles. Among the various Spatial Transcriptomics techniques available, Visium has emerged as the most widely adopted. However, its accessibility is limited by high costs, the need for specialized expertise, and slow clinical integration. Additionally, gene capture inefficiencies lead to significant dropout, corrupting acquired data. To address these challenges, the deep learning community has explored the gene expression prediction task directly from histology images. Yet, inconsistencies in datasets, preprocessing, and training protocols hinder fair comparisons between models. To bridge this gap, we introduce SpaRED, a systematically curated database comprising 26 public datasets, providing a standardized resource for model evaluation. We further propose SpaCKLE, a state-of-the-art transformer-based gene expression completion model that reduces mean squared error by over 82.5% compared to existing approaches. Finally, we establish the SpaRED benchmark, evaluating eight state-of-the-art prediction models on both raw and SpaCKLE-completed data, demonstrating SpaCKLE substantially improves the results across all the gene expression prediction models. Altogether, our contributions constitute the most comprehensive benchmark of gene expression prediction from histology images to date and a stepping stone for future research on Spatial Transcriptomics.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2407.13027</p></details> |
| **[Spatially-Enhanced Recurrent Memory for Long-Range Mapless Navigation via End-to-End Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05997v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in robot navigation, particularly with end-to-end learning approaches such as reinforcement learning (RL), have demonstrated strong performance. However, successful navigation still depends on two key capabilities: mapping and planning (explicitly or implicitly). Classical approaches rely on explicit mapping pipelines to register egocentric observations into a coherent map. In contrast, end-to-end learning often achieves this implicitly -- through recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that fuse current and historical observations into a latent space for planning. While existing architectures, such as LSTM and GRU, can capture temporal dependencies, our findings reveal a critical limitation: their inability to effectively perform spatial memorization. This capability is essential for integrating sequential observations from varying perspectives to build spatial representations that support planning. To address this, we propose Spatially-Enhanced Recurrent Units (SRUs) -- a simple yet effective modification to existing RNNs -- that enhance spatial memorization. We further introduce an attention-based network architecture integrated with SRUs, enabling long-range mapless navigation using a single forward-facing stereo camera. We also employ regularization techniques to facilitate robust end-to-end recurrent training via RL. Experimental results show 23.5% overall improvement in long-range navigation compared to existing RNNs. With SRU memory, our method outperforms RL baselines -- one relying on explicit mapping and the other on stacked historical observations -- by 29.6% and 105.0%, respectively, across diverse environments requiring long-horizon mapping and memorization. Finally, we address the sim-to-real gap by leveraging large-scale pretraining on synthetic depth data, enabling zero-shot transfer for deployment across diverse and complex real-world environments.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Spatial disaggregation of time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04065v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal modeling of economic aggregates is increasingly relevant in regional science due to the presence of both spatial spillovers and temporal dynamics. Traditional temporal disaggregation methods, such as Chow-Lin, often ignore spatial dependence, potentially losing important regional information. We propose a novel methodology for spatiotemporal disaggregation, integrating spatial autoregressive models, benchmarking restrictions, and auxiliary covariates. The approach accommodates partially observed regional data through an anchoring mechanism, ensuring consistency with known aggregates while reducing prediction variance. We establish identifiability and asymptotic normality of the estimator under general conditions, including non-Gaussian and heteroskedastic residuals. Extensive simulations confirm the method's robustness across a wide range of spatial autocorrelations and covariate informativeness. The methodology is illustrated by disaggregating Spanish GDP into 17 autonomous communities from 2002 to 2023, using auxiliary indicators and principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction. This framework extends classical temporal disaggregation to the spatial domain, providing accurate regional estimates while accounting for spatial spillovers and irregular data availability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-aware Transformer-GRU Framework for Enhanced Glaucoma Diagnosis from 3D OCT Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05702v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness, necessitates early detection for accurate and timely intervention to prevent irreversible vision loss. In this study, we present a novel deep learning framework that leverages the diagnostic value of 3D Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging for automated glaucoma detection. In this framework, we integrate a pre-trained Vision Transformer on retinal data for rich slice-wise feature extraction and a bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit for capturing inter-slice spatial dependencies. This dual-component approach enables comprehensive analysis of local nuances and global structural integrity, crucial for accurate glaucoma diagnosis. Experimental results on a large dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art ones, achieving an F1-score of 93.01%, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 69.33%, and AUC of 94.20%. The framework's ability to leverage the valuable information in 3D OCT data holds significant potential for enhancing clinical decision support systems and improving patient outcomes in glaucoma management.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAC-MIL: Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03973v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Collaborative Spatial Perception via Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03837v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios. Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS) classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions, confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE GLOBECOM 2025</p></details> |

While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for SatML; we put special emphasis on a specific problem setting where our coauthors can immediately use our findings to augment clustered agricultural surveys for SatML monitoring in Togo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-preserving contrastive learning for spatial time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06380v4)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of neural network models largely relies on learning meaningful latent patterns from data, where self-supervised learning of informative representations can enhance model performance and generalisability. However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations. This provides insights to design more effective neural networks for data-driven transportation research. Our code is made openly accessible with all resulting data at https://github.com/yiru-jiao/spclt</p></details> | <details><summary>TL;DR...</summary><p>TL;DR: Preserving certain structures of similarity relations in spatio-temporal data can improve downstream task performance via contrastive learning</p></details> |

Previous Text-to-speech (TTS) works have focused primarily on the technical aspects of producing natural-sounding speech, such as intonation, rhythm, and clarity. However, they overlook the fact that there is a growing emphasis on spatial perception of synthesized speech, which may provide immersive experience in gaming and virtual reality. To solve this issue, in this paper, we present a novel multi-modal TTS approach, namely Image-indicated Immersive Text-to-speech Synthesis (I2TTS). Specifically, we introduce a scene prompt encoder that integrates visual scene prompts directly into the synthesis pipeline to control the speech generation process. Additionally, we propose a reverberation classification and refinement technique that adjusts the synthesized mel-spectrogram to enhance the immersive experience, ensuring that the involved reverberation condition matches the scene accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves high-quality scene and spatial matching without compromising speech naturalness, marking a significant advancement in the field of context-aware speech synthesis.

Dimension reduction methods can significantly simplify this process, provided that they account for the complex dependencies between variables and across time and space. Nonlinear blind source separation has emerged as a promising approach, particularly following recent advances in identifiability results. Building on these developments, we introduce the identifiable autoregressive variational autoencoder, which ensures the identifiability of latent components consisting of nonstationary autoregressive processes. The blind source separation efficacy of the proposed method is showcased through a simulation study, where it is compared against state-of-the-art methods, and the spatio-temporal prediction performance is evaluated against several competitors on air pollution and weather datasets.</p></details> |  |

Nutrient stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment. Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral, and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data, document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low, medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies. We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop management and improved plant health.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 7 Tables</p></details> |

Many research works, including Potential Outcome Model and Structural Causal Model, have been proposed to realize it. However, their modelings, theoretical foundations and application approaches are usually different. Moreover, there is a lack of graphical approach to infer spatio-temporal counterfactuals, that considers spatial and temporal interactions between multiple units. Thus, in this work, our aim is to investigate a survey to compare and discuss different counterfactual models, theories and approaches, and further build a unified graphical causal frameworks to infer the spatio-temporal counterfactuals.</p></details> | in press |
| **[Mechanistic Learning with Guided Diffusion Models to Predict Spatio-Temporal Brain Tumor Growth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09610v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time predictions that account for mechanistic priors.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[A Zero-Inflated Spatio-Temporal Model for Integrating Fishery-Dependent and Independent Data under Preferential Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09336v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sustainable management of marine ecosystems is vital for maintaining healthy fishery resources, and benefits from advanced scientific tools to accurately assess species distribution patterns. In fisheries science, two primary data sources are used: fishery-independent data (FID), collected through systematic surveys, and fishery-dependent data (FDD), obtained from commercial fishing activities. While these sources provide complementary information, their distinct sampling schemes - systematic for FID and preferential for FDD - pose significant integration challenges. This study introduces a novel spatio-temporal model that integrates FID and FDD, addressing challenges associated with zero-inflation and preferential sampling (PS) common in ecological data. The model employs a six-layer structure to differentiate between presence-absence and biomass observations, offering a robust framework for ecological studies affected by PS biases. Simulation results demonstrate the model's accuracy in parameter estimation across diverse PS scenarios and its ability to detect preferential signals. Application to the study of the distribution patterns of the European sardine populations along the southern Portuguese continental shelf illustrates the model's effectiveness in integrating diverse data sources and incorporating environmental and vessel-specific covariates. The model reveals spatio-temporal variability in sardine presence and biomass, providing actionable insights for fisheries management. Beyond ecology, this framework offers broad applicability to data integration challenges in other disciplines.</p></details> |  |
| **[DyC-STG: Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network for Real-time Data Credibility Analysis in IoT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06483v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wide spreading of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors generates vast spatio-temporal data streams, but ensuring data credibility is a critical yet unsolved challenge for applications like smart homes. While spatio-temporal graph (STG) models are a leading paradigm for such data, they often fall short in dynamic, human-centric environments due to two fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on static graph topologies, which fail to capture physical, event-driven dynamics, and (2) their tendency to confuse spurious correlations with true causality, undermining robustness in human-centric environments. To address these gaps, we propose the Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (DyC-STG), a novel framework designed for real-time data credibility analysis in IoT. Our framework features two synergistic contributions: an event-driven dynamic graph module that adapts the graph topology in real-time to reflect physical state changes, and a causal reasoning module to distill causally-aware representations by strictly enforcing temporal precedence. To facilitate the research in this domain we release two new real-world datasets. Comprehensive experiments show that DyC-STG establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving an F1-Score of up to 0.930.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks Approach for Predicting Silent Data Corruption inducing Circuit-Level Faults](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06289v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Silent Data Errors (SDEs) from time-zero defects and aging degrade safety-critical systems. Functional testing detects SDE-related faults but is expensive to simulate. We present a unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) for fast, accurate prediction of long-cycle fault impact probabilities (FIPs) in large sequential circuits, supporting quantitative risk assessment. Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to capture topology and signal timing; dedicated spatial and temporal encoders predict multi-cycle FIPs efficiently. On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). The framework accepts features from testability metrics or fault simulation, allowing efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. A test-point selection study shows that choosing observation points by predicted FIPs improves detection of long-cycle, hard-to-detect faults. The approach scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization and fits downstream electronic design automation flows.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, plan to submit to ACM TODAES</p></details> |

Traditional input modalities, such as Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements. Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network (MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI, comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures (VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety of applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the precise and efficient decoding of MI remains challenging due to their non-stationary nature and low signal-to-noise ratio. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end deep learning framework of Discriminative Residual Dense Convolutional Autoencoder with Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (DRDCAE-STGNN) to enhance the MI feature learning and classification. Specifically, the DRDCAE module leverages residual-dense connections to learn discriminative latent representations through joint reconstruction and classifica-tion, while the STGNN module captures dynamic spatial dependencies via a learnable graph adjacency matrix and models temporal dynamics using bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM). Extensive evaluations on BCI Competition IV 2a, 2b, and PhysioNet datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 95.42%, 97.51%, and 90.15%, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component, and interpreta-bility analysis reveals neurophysiologically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, despite its complexity, the model maintains a feasible parameter count and an inference time of 0.32 ms per sample. These results indicate that our method offers a robust, accurate, and interpretable solution for MI-EEG decoding, with strong generalizability across subjects and tasks and meeting the requirements for potential real-time BCI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to IEEE Journal</p></details> |
| **[Select, then Balance: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Exogenous-Aware Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05779v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting aims to predict the future state of dynamic systems and plays an important role in multiple fields. However, existing solutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target variables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into the model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to promote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two challenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the target system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and future variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \model, a novel framework for modeling \underline{exo}genous variables in \underline{s}patio-\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select, then balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated expert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent space to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized sub-experts. Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which recomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs are integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic balance during the modeling process. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency of our proposed framework.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

To address key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro) contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling spatial dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures, under review for journal publication</p></details> |

Specifically, we model the observations by two weakly time-stationary point processes with spatial intensity measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ over the expanding window $(0,t]$ as $t$ increases to infinity, and establish sharp convergence rates of the empirical UOT in terms of the intrinsic dimensions of the measures. We assume a sub-quadratic temporal growth condition of the variance of the process, which allows for a wide range of temporal dependencies. As the growth approaches quadratic, the convergence rate becomes slower. This variance assumption is related to the time-reduced factorial covariance measure, and we exemplify its validity for various point processes, including the Poisson cluster, Hawkes, Neyman-Scott, and log-Gaussian Cox processes. Complementary to our upper bounds, we also derive matching lower bounds for various spatio-temporal point processes of interest and establish near minimax rate optimality of the empirical Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally, 76 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[S2M2ECG: Spatio-temporal bi-directional State Space Model Enabled Multi-branch Mamba for ECG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03066v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the most effective methods for cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis, multi-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals present a characteristic multi-sensor information fusion challenge that has been continuously researched in deep learning domains. Despite the numerous algorithms proposed with different DL architectures, maintaining a balance among performance, computational complexity, and multi-source ECG feature fusion remains challenging. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across various fields. Their inherent design for high-efficiency computation and linear complexity makes them particularly suitable for low-dimensional data like ECGs. This work proposes S2M2ECG, an SSM architecture featuring three-level fusion mechanisms: (1) Spatio-temporal bi-directional SSMs with segment tokenization for low-level signal fusion, (2) Intra-lead temporal information fusion with bi-directional scanning to enhance recognition accuracy in both forward and backward directions, (3) Cross-lead feature interaction modules for spatial information fusion. To fully leverage the ECG-specific multi-lead mechanisms inherent in ECG signals, a multi-branch design and lead fusion modules are incorporated, enabling individual analysis of each lead while ensuring seamless integration with others. Experimental results reveal that S2M2ECG achieves superior performance in the rhythmic, morphological, and clinical scenarios. Moreover, its lightweight architecture ensures it has nearly the fewest parameters among existing models, making it highly suitable for efficient inference and convenient deployment. Collectively, S2M2ECG offers a promising alternative that strikes an excellent balance among performance, computational complexity, and ECG-specific characteristics, paving the way for high-performance, lightweight computations in CVD diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Sequential Ordinal Models: Application to Invasive Weeds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01976v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multivariate sequential ordinal model is investigated for use in the Bayesian analysis of spatio-temporal ordinal data. The sequential ordinal model likelihood is equivalent to a binary model conditional on unknown regression coefficients and spatio-temporal random effects. Therefore, estimation and prediction in the space-time context can proceed using the well-established dynamic generalised linear model framework. Moreover, the sequential ordinal model avoids the ordering constraints on the threshold parameters that determine the category break points required by cumulative ordinal models, and so simplifies the estimation procedure for high-dimensional space-time applications using Bayesian inference. The dynamic spatio-temporal sequential ordinal model is applied to estimate foliage cover abundance of four actively managed invasive alien species. These invasive weed species are observed by means of a modified Braun-Blanquet score that is commonly used in vegetation studies and constitutes ordinal data. The multivariate ordinal data for the managed weeds species are sparsely distributed in space and time with few observations recorded in high foliage cover categories. A separable model for space-time dependence that maintains parameter interpretability in the presence of aggregated ordinal categories is therefore developed. Estimation and prediction is demonstrated using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) methods developed for univariate spatio-temporal models. Bayesian estimation and prediction shows that the four invasive weed species differentially respond to habitat type, control effort and accessibility, and share similar magnitudes of dependence with short effective spatial ranges and strong temporal autocorrelations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transforming Norm-based To Graph-based Spatial Representation for Spatio-Temporal Epidemiological Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14539v3)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pandemics, with their profound societal and economic impacts, pose significant threats to global health, mortality rates, economic stability, and political landscapes. In response to these challenges, numerous studies have employed spatio-temporal models to enhance our understanding and management of these complex phenomena. These spatio-temporal models can be roughly divided into two main spatial categories: norm-based and graph-based. Norm-based models are usually more accurate and easier to model but are more computationally intensive and require more data to fit. On the other hand, graph-based models are less accurate and harder to model but are less computationally intensive and require fewer data to fit. As such, ideally, one would like to use a graph-based model while preserving the representation accuracy obtained by the norm-based model. In this study, we explore the ability to transform from norm-based to graph-based spatial representation for these models. We first show no analytical mapping between the two exists, requiring one to use approximation numerical methods instead. We introduce a novel framework for this task together with twelve possible implementations using a wide range of heuristic optimization approaches. Our findings show that by leveraging agent-based simulations and heuristic algorithms for the graph node's location and population's spatial walk dynamics approximation one can use graph-based spatial representation without losing much of the model's accuracy and expressiveness. We investigate our framework for three real-world cases, achieving 94\% accuracy preservation, on average. Moreover, an analysis of synthetic cases shows the proposed framework is relatively robust for changes in both spatial and temporal properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Pixels: Introducing Geometric-Semantic World Priors for Video-based Embodied Models via Spatio-temporal Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00210v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence. While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model. Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic, implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate 1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Flow Matching for Learning Spatio-Temporal Trajectories in 4D Longitudinal Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21580v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions. While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e. predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports $3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.</p></details> |  |

To fully leverage this information, however, the extracted features must be organized in a structured and meaningful way that supports efficient access and use. One promising approach is question answering (QA), which allows users -- especially those unfamiliar with database query languages -- to retrieve knowledge in a natural and intuitive manner. In this project, we developed a GeoQA system by integrating a spatio-temporal knowledge graph (KG) constructed from historical map data with large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we have defined the ontology to guide the construction of the spatio-temporal KG and investigated workflows of two different types of GeoQA: factual and descriptive. Additional data sources, such as historical map images and internet search results, are incorporated into our framework to provide extra context for descriptive GeoQA. Evaluation results demonstrate that the system can generate answers with a high delivery rate and a high semantic accuracy. To make the framework accessible, we further developed a web application that supports interactive querying and visualization.</p></details> |  |

The proposed system requires neither access to multi-channel training data nor prior knowledge about the number or placement of microphones. It works for both a compact microphone array and distributed microphones, with minor adjustments. Due to its superior handling of overlapping speech during segmentation, the proposed pipeline significantly outperforms the single-channel pyannote approach, both in a scenario with a compact microphone array and in a setup with distributed microphones. Additionally, we show that, unlike fully spatial diarization pipelines, the proposed system can correctly track speakers when they change positions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of INTERSPEECH</p></details> |

They pose, however, significant computational challenges in high-dimensional settings, which frequently arise in spatial-temporal applications. We present DALIA, a highly scalable framework for performing Bayesian inference tasks on spatio-temporal multivariate GPs, based on the methodology of integrated nested Laplace approximations. Our approach relies on a sparse inverse covariance matrix formulation of the GP, puts forward a GPU-accelerated block-dense approach, and introduces a hierarchical, triple-layer, distributed memory parallel scheme. We showcase weak scaling performance surpassing the state-of-the-art by two orders of magnitude on a model whose parameter space is 8$\times$ larger and measure strong scaling speedups of three orders of magnitude when running on 496 GH200 superchips on the Alps supercomputer. Applying DALIA to air pollution data from northern Italy over 48 days, we showcase refined spatial resolutions over the aggregated pollutant measurements.</p></details> |  |

Privacy statutes such as the GDPR require that any individual's contribution be unlearned on demand, yet retraining deep models from scratch for every request is untenable. We introduce MobText-SISA, a scalable machine-unlearning framework that extends Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and Aggregated (SISA) training to heterogeneous spatio-temporal data. MobText-SISA first embeds each trip's numerical and linguistic features into a shared latent space, then employs similarity-aware clustering to distribute samples across shards so that future deletions touch only a single constituent model while preserving inter-shard diversity. Each shard is trained incrementally; at inference time, constituent predictions are aggregated to yield the output. Deletion requests trigger retraining solely of the affected shard from its last valid checkpoint, guaranteeing exact unlearning. Experiments on a ten-month real-world mobility log demonstrate that MobText-SISA (i) sustains baseline predictive accuracy, and (ii) consistently outperforms random sharding in both error and convergence speed. These results establish MobText-SISA as a practical foundation for privacy-compliant analytics on multimodal mobility data at urban scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The 33rd ACM International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems(SIGSPATIAL '25) as a short paper in the Short Paper Track</p></details> |

It aims to provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network (\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception. The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details, while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.</p></details> |  |

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the sparse event-driven neural processing and energy-efficient information transmission in the brain, offer a promising alternative for achieving low-power computing. Integrating the event-driven efficiency of spiking neurons with the advanced capabilities of LLMs represents a promising direction for power-efficient LLMs. This work specifically delves into the design of compressed spiking LLMs. Here, we revisit spatial and temporal pruning from the perspective of SNNs and propose a novel spatio-temporal pruning framework for Spiking LLMs to optimize computational efficiency while preserving high performance. Our spatial pruning technique reduces the number of active neurons and attention heads, effectively lowering the computational complexity of the model. Meanwhile, temporal pruning minimizes inference latency by dynamically adjusting the number of timesteps required for different layers. By combining these approaches with other compression techniques, we present the first work in the domain of Spiking LLMs to jointly explore spatial pruning, temporal pruning, extreme quantization and knowledge distillation strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation of our proposed framework for SpikingBERT on the large-scale GLUE benchmark demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in terms of computational operations and inference latency. Our approach offers a compelling solution for real-time, low-power natural language processing applications, making Spiking LLMs more practical for deployment on edge devices and in power-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |

We establish representer theorems for time dependent OV-RKHS interpolation, derive Sobolev type approximation bounds for smooth vector fields, and provide spectral convergence guarantees for kernel Koopman operator approximations. This framework supports efficient reduced order modeling and long term prediction of high dimensional nonlinear systems, offering theoretically grounded tools for forecasting, control, and uncertainty quantification in spatio-temporal machine learning.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Annua...</summary><p>Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 2025</p></details> |

Although various domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the adaptability of deep-based RPM models in unseen deployment environments, considerations in aspects such as privacy concerns and real-time adaptation restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for RPM tasks in this work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the frequency domain of BVP signals, but also that inconsistency in the time domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based self-supervised \textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration (\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference. Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation without accessing source data. The code will be released later.</p></details> |  |

However, current models struggle with ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i) Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii) Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior performance of STA-GANN.</p></details> |  |

While current spatial media technologies have primarily focused on capturing or replaying content as static assets, often disconnected from the viewer's environment or offering limited interactivity, the means to describe an experience's underlying semantic and interactive structure remains underexplored. We propose a descriptive framework called MAR-ED based on three core primitives: 1) Event Primitives for semantic scene graph representation, 2) Keyframe Primitives for efficient and meaningful data access, and 3) Playback Primitives for user-driven adaptive interactive playback of recorded MAR experience.

| **[STAGNet: A Spatio-Temporal Graph and LSTM Framework for Accident Anticipation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15216v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[UST-SSM: Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Models for Point Cloud Video Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14604v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models (SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity, the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D, and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

Interpretation of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively. OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention variants attained similar performance.

While various dynamic computation methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn, allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes. Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%, and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA models.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Although Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment, and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that STPFormer consistently sets new SOTA results, with ablation and visualizations confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compact Attention: Exploiting Structured Spatio-Temporal Sparsity for Fast Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12969v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computational demands of self-attention mechanisms pose a critical challenge for transformer-based video generation, particularly in synthesizing ultra-long sequences. Current approaches, such as factorized attention and fixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal redundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion transformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit structured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads dynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern, cross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods either impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a hardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive tiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via dynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity levels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search algorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention pathways. Our method achieves 1.6~2.5x acceleration in attention computation on single-GPU setups while maintaining comparable visual quality with full-attention baselines. This work provides a principled approach to unlocking efficient long-form video generation through structured sparsity exploitation.

| **[Root Cause Analysis of Hydrogen Bond Separation in Spatio-Temporal Molecular Dynamics using Causal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12500v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) face challenges, including resource-heavy computations and the need to manually scan outputs to detect "interesting events," such as the formation and persistence of hydrogen bonds between atoms of different molecules. A critical research gap lies in identifying the underlying causes of hydrogen bond formation and separation -understanding which interactions or prior events contribute to their emergence over time. With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal data analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these phenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims to identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation events. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an "intervention" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and separation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models are built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us to infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal graphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step to infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal models. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional distributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation, this framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular dynamic systems. We validate the efficacy of our model empirically on the atomic trajectories that used MDS for chiral separation, demonstrating that we can predict many steps in the future and also find the variables driving the observed changes in the system.</p></details> | Submitted to ACM |
| **[STM3: Mixture of Multiscale Mamba for Long-Term Spatio-Temporal Time-Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12247v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, spatio-temporal time-series prediction has developed rapidly, yet existing deep learning methods struggle with learning complex long-term spatio-temporal dependencies efficiently. The long-term spatio-temporal dependency learning brings two new challenges: 1) The long-term temporal sequence includes multiscale information naturally which is hard to extract efficiently; 2) The multiscale temporal information from different nodes is highly correlated and hard to model. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM2) that includes a multiscale Mamba architecture to capture the multiscale information efficiently and simultaneously, and an adaptive graph causal convolution network to learn the complex multiscale spatio-temporal dependency. STM2 includes hierarchical information aggregation for different-scale information that guarantees their distinguishability. To capture diverse temporal dynamics across all spatial nodes more efficiently, we further propose an enhanced version termed \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM3) that employs a special Mixture-of-Experts architecture, including a more stable routing strategy and a causal contrastive learning strategy to enhance the scale distinguishability. We prove that STM3 has much better routing smoothness and guarantees the pattern disentanglement for each expert successfully. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate STM2/STM3's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in long-term spatio-temporal time-series prediction.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposed PTSM (Physiology-aware and Task-invariant Spatio-temporal Modeling), a novel framework for interpretable and robust EEG decoding across unseen subjects. PTSM employs a dual-branch masking mechanism that independently learns personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns, enabling the model to preserve individual-specific neural characteristics while extracting task-relevant, population-shared features. The masks are factorized across temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing fine-grained modulation of dynamic EEG patterns with low computational overhead. To further address representational entanglement, PTSM enforces information-theoretic constraints that decompose latent embeddings into orthogonal task-related and subject-related subspaces. The model is trained end-to-end via a multi-objective loss integrating classification, contrastive, and disentanglement objectives. Extensive experiments on cross-subject motor imagery datasets demonstrate that PTSM achieves strong zero-shot generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without subject-specific calibration. Results highlight the efficacy of disentangled neural representations for achieving both personalized and transferable decoding in non-stationary neurophysiological settings.</p></details> |  |

While recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding, their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs, revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task. Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning. To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Conventional approaches based on large-scale fixed antenna arrays and UAV trajectory optimization struggle to balance energy efficiency, real-time adaptation, and spatial flexibility. The movable antenna (MA) technology has emerged as a promising solution, offering enhanced spatial flexibility and reduced energy consumption to overcome the bottlenecks of urban low-altitude communications. However, MA deployment faces a critical velocity mismatch between UAV mobility and mechanical repositioning latency, undermining real-time link optimization and security assurance. To overcome this, we propose a predictive MA-UAV collaborative control framework. First, optimal antenna positions are derived via secrecy rate maximization. Second, a Transformer-enhanced long short-term memory (LSTM) network predicts future MA positions by capturing spatio-temporal correlations in antenna trajectories. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior prediction accuracy (NMSE reduction exceeds 49\%) and communication reliability versus current popular benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Retrieval Augmented Spatio-Temporal Framework for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16623v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is a cornerstone of modern intelligent transportation systems and a critical task in spatio-temporal forecasting. Although advanced Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain: (i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns; and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

While traditional matrix time series focus mainly on temporal evolution, our approach incorporates both spatial and temporal dynamics, enabling simultaneous analysis of interactions across multiple dimensions. The inherent endogeneity in spatio-temporal autoregressive models renders ordinary least squares estimation inconsistent. To overcome this difficulty while simultaneously estimating two distinct weight matrices with banded structure, we develop an iterated generalized Yule-Walker estimator by adapting a generalized method of moments framework based on Yule-Walker equations. Moreover, unlike conventional models that employ a single bandwidth parameter, the dual-bandwidth specification in our framework requires a new two-step, ratio-based sequential estimation procedure.</p></details> |  |

Beyond a high number of ignitions, the country has experienced devastating mega-fires, such as those in 2017. Accurate forecasting of wildfire occurrence and burned areas is therefore essential for effective firefighting resource allocation and emergency preparedness. In this study, we present a novel two-stage ensemble approach that extends the widely used latent Gaussian modelling framework with the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) for spatio-temporal wildfire forecasting. The first stage uses XGBoost, a gradient boosting model, to identify wildfire patterns from environmental covariates and historical fire records, producing one-month-ahead point forecasts for fire counts and burned area. These predictions are then incorporated as external covariates in a latent Gaussian model, which includes additional spatiotemporal random effects to produce the final probabilistic forecasts of monthly total fire counts and burned area at the council level. To effectively model both moderate and extreme wildfire events, we implement the extended generalised Pareto (eGP) likelihood (a sub-asymptotic distribution) within the INLA framework. We also develop and discuss penalised complexity priors (PC-priors) for the eGP parameters and provide a comprehensive comparison of the eGP likelihood against other commonly employed distributions in environmental modelling, such as the Gamma and Weibull distributions. The proposed framework addresses the challenge of accessing future environmental covariates, which are typically unavailable at prediction time, and demonstrates strong performance in one-month-ahead wildfire forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We present STAC, a cross-cameras surveillance system that leverages spatio-temporal associations for efficient object tracking under constrained network conditions. STAC integrates multi-resolution feature learning, ensuring robustness under variable networked system level optimizations such as frame filtering, FFmpeg-based compression, and Region-of-Interest (RoI) masking, to eliminate redundant content across distributed video streams while preserving downstream model accuracy for object identification and tracking. Evaluated on NVIDIA's AICity Challenge dataset, STAC achieves a 76\% improvement in tracking accuracy and an 8.6x reduction in inference latency over a standard multi-object multi-camera tracking baseline (using YOLOv4 and DeepSORT). Furthermore, 29\% of redundant frames are filtered, significantly reducing data volume without compromising inference quality.</p></details> |  |

Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

We introduce a Physics- and Geometry- Aware Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator ($\pi$G-Sp$^2$GNO) for learning the solution operators of time-independent and time-dependent PDEs. The proposed approach first improves upon the recently developed Sp$^2$GNO by enabling geometry awareness and subsequently exploits the governing physics to learn the underlying solution operator in a simulation-free setup. While the spatio-spectral structure present in the proposed architecture allows multiscale learning, two separate strategies for enabling geometry awareness is introduced in this paper. For time dependent problems, we also introduce a novel hybrid physics informed loss function that combines higher-order time-marching scheme with upscaled theory inspired stochastic projection scheme. This allows accurate integration of the physics-information into the loss function. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated on number of benchmark examples involving regular and complex domains, variation in geometry during inference, and time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results obtained illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach as compared to the state-of-the-art physics-informed neural operator algorithms in the literature.</p></details> |  |

Thus, the USVs need to continuously adapt their paths with real-time information to avoid collisions and follow the path of least resistance to the goal via exploiting ocean currents. In this regard, we introduce a novel algorithm, called Self-Morphing Adaptive Replanning Tree for dynamic Obstacles and Currents (SMART-OC), that facilitates real-time time-risk optimal replanning in dynamic environments. SMART-OC integrates the obstacle risks along a path with the time cost to reach the goal to find the time-risk optimal path. The effectiveness of SMART-OC is validated by simulation experiments, which demonstrate that the USV performs fast replannings to avoid dynamic obstacles and exploit ocean currents to successfully reach the goal.</p></details> |  |

Despite this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI. This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}. To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for \underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, incomplete version</p></details> |

However, current modeling approaches are limited in capturing such complex interplay between human activities and commercial land use change under and following disturbances. Such interactions have been more effectively captured in current resilient urban planning theories. This study designs and calibrates a Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change (Urban-STA4CLC) to predict both the yearly decline and expansion of commercial land use at census block level under cumulative impact of disasters on human activities over two years. Guided by urban theories, Urban-STA4CLC integrates both spatial and temporal attention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules. Resilience theory guides a disaster-aware temporal attention module that captures visitation dynamics. Spatial economic theory informs a multi-relational spatial attention module for inter-block representation. Diffusion theory contributes a regularization term that constrains land use transitions. The model performs significantly better than non-theoretical baselines in predicting commercial land use change under the scenario of recurrent hurricanes, with around 19% improvement in F1 score (0.8763). The effectiveness of the theory-guided modules was further validated through ablation studies. The research demonstrates that embedding urban theory into commercial land use modeling models may substantially enhance the capacity to capture its gains and losses. These advances in commercial land use modeling contribute to land use research that accounts for cumulative impacts of recurrent disasters and shifts in economic activity patterns.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often rely on complex module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts, high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency, reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while maintaining competitive recognition performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[B-VLLM: A Vision Large Language Model with Balanced Spatio-Temporal Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09919v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) integrated with vision encoders have shown promising performance in vision understanding. The key of VLLMs is to encode visual content into sequences of visual tokens, enabling VLLMs to simultaneously process both visual and textual content. However, understanding videos, especially long videos, remain a challenge to VLLMs as the number of visual tokens grows rapidly when encoding videos, resulting in the risk of exceeding the context window of VLLMs and introducing heavy computation burden. To restrict the number of visual tokens, existing VLLMs either: (1) uniformly downsample videos into a fixed number of frames or (2) reducing the number of visual tokens encoded from each frame. We argue the former solution neglects the rich temporal cue in videos and the later overlooks the spatial details in each frame. In this work, we present Balanced-VLLM (B-VLLM): a novel VLLM framework that aims to effectively leverage task relevant spatio-temporal cues while restricting the number of visual tokens under the VLLM context window length. At the core of our method, we devise a text-conditioned adaptive frame selection module to identify frames relevant to the visual understanding task. The selected frames are then de-duplicated using a temporal frame token merging technique. The visual tokens of the selected frames are processed through a spatial token sampling module and an optional spatial token merging strategy to achieve precise control over the token count. Experimental results show that B-VLLM is effective in balancing the number of frames and visual tokens in video understanding, yielding superior performance on various video understanding benchmarks.

While many spatio-temporal methods focus on improving accuracy, fairness has recently gained attention due to growing evidence that biased predictions in spatio-temporal applications can disproportionately disadvantage certain demographic or geographic groups, thereby reinforcing existing socioeconomic inequalities and undermining the ethical deployment of AI in public services. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, FairDRL-ST, based on disentangled representation learning, to address fairness concerns in spatio-temporal prediction, with a particular focus on mobility demand forecasting. By leveraging adversarial learning and disentangled representation learning, our framework learns to separate attributes that contain sensitive information. Unlike existing methods that enforce fairness through supervised learning, which may lead to overcompensation and degraded performance, our framework achieves fairness in an unsupervised manner with minimal performance loss. We apply our framework to real-world urban mobility datasets and demonstrate its ability to close fairness gaps while delivering competitive predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art fairness-aware methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Research Paper (short) at ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025.

| **[Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement for Federated Instrument Segmentation in Surgical Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23759v2)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical instrument segmentation under Federated Learning (FL) is a promising direction, which enables multiple surgical sites to collaboratively train the model without centralizing datasets. However, there exist very limited FL works in surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider inherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show diverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation; ii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data generation with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized FL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST), which wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and global-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site training, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to encode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized globally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including the temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel selection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating model adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an explicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model convergence during fusion for improving model generalization.</p></details> |  |

Given that the typical data (i.e., videos and images) collected by the fleet of UAVs deployed in such scenarios can be considerably larger than what the onboard computers can process, the UAVs need to offload their data in real-time to the edge and the cloud for further processing. To that end, we present the design of AerialDB - a lightweight decentralized data storage and query system that can store and process time series data on a multi-UAV system comprising: A) a fleet of hundreds of UAVs fitted with onboard computers, and B) ground-based edge servers connected through a cellular link. Leveraging lightweight techniques for content-based replica placement and indexing of shards, AerialDB has been optimized for efficient processing of different possible combinations of typical spatial and temporal queries performed by real-world disaster management applications. Using containerized deployment spanning up to 400 drones and 80 edges, we demonstrate that AerialDB is able to scale efficiently while providing near real-time performance with different realistic workloads. Further, AerialDB comprises a decentralized and locality-aware distributed execution engine which provides graceful degradation of performance upon edge failures with relatively low latency while processing large spatio-temporal data. AerialDB exhibits comparable insertion performance and 100 times improvement in query performance against state-of-the-art baseline. Moreover, it exhibits a 10 times and 100 times improvement with insertion and query workloads respectively over the cloud baseline.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the first treatment-aware spatio-temporal diffusion model that is able to generate future masks demonstrating lesion evolution in MS. Our voxel-space approach incorporates multi-modal patient data, including MRI and treatment information, to forecast new and enlarging T2 (NET2) lesion masks at a future time point. Extensive experiments on a multi-centre dataset of 2131 patient 3D MRIs from randomized clinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS demonstrate that our generative model is able to accurately predict NET2 lesion masks for patients across six different treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate our model has the potential for real-world clinical applications through downstream tasks such as future lesion count and location estimation, binary lesion activity classification, and generating counterfactual future NET2 masks for several treatments with different efficacies. This work highlights the potential of causal, image-based generative models as powerful tools for advancing data-driven prognostics in MS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI 2025 (LMID Workshop)</p></details> |

Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity, normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33 ground-based sensors.

While the fusion of surround-view 4D radar and cameras offers a promising low-cost solution, effectively extracting and integrating features from these heterogeneous sensors remains challenging. This paper introduces MetaOcc, a novel multi-modal framework for omnidirectional 3D occupancy prediction that leverages both multi-view 4D radar and images. To address the limitations of directly applying LiDAR-oriented encoders to sparse radar data, we propose a Radar Height Self-Attention module that enhances vertical spatial reasoning and feature extraction. Additionally, a Hierarchical Multi-scale Multi-modal Fusion strategy is developed to perform adaptive local-global fusion across modalities and time, mitigating spatio-temporal misalignments and enriching fused feature representations. To reduce reliance on expensive point cloud annotations, we further propose a pseudo-label generation pipeline based on an open-set segmentor. This enables a semi-supervised strategy that achieves 90% of the fully supervised performance using only 50% of the ground truth labels, offering an effective trade-off between annotation cost and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaOcc under full supervision achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by +0.47 SC IoU and +4.02 mIoU on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, and by +1.16 SC IoU and +1.24 mIoU on the SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset. These results demonstrate the scalability and robustness of MetaOcc across sensor domains and training conditions, paving the way for practical deployment in real-world autonomous systems.

| **[Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing Forecast for Long-term Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02689v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting uses recent measurements by sensors installed at chosen locations to forecast the future road traffic. Existing work either assumes all locations are equipped with sensors or focuses on short-term forecast. This paper studies partial sensing forecast of long-term traffic, assuming sensors are available only at some locations. The problem is challenging due to the unknown data distribution at unsensed locations, the intricate spatio-temporal correlation in long-term forecasting, as well as noise to traffic patterns. We propose a Spatio-temporal Long-term Partial sensing Forecast model (SLPF) for traffic prediction, with several novel contributions, including a rank-based embedding technique to reduce the impact of noise in data, a spatial transfer matrix to overcome the spatial distribution shift from sensed locations to unsensed locations, and a multi-step training process that utilizes all available data to successively refine the model parameters for better accuracy. Extensive experiments on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate its superior performance.

We implement a Bayesian hierarchical Beta regression model to analyze regional obesity rates, integrating spatial and temporal random effects, alongside gender and various exogenous predictors. The model leverages the Stochastic Search Variable Selection technique to identify significant predictors supported by the data. The analysis reveals both regional heterogeneity and dependence in obesity rates over the study period, emphasizing the importance of considering gender and spatial correlation in explaining its dynamics over time. In fact, the inclusion of structured spatial and temporal random effects captures the complexities of regional variations over time. These random effects, along with gender, emerge as the primary determinants of obesity prevalence across Italian regions, while the role of exogenous covariates is found to be minimal at the regional level. While socioeconomic and lifestyle factors remain fundamental at a micro-level, the findings demonstrate that the integration of spatial and temporal structures is critical for capturing macro-level obesity variations.</p></details> |  |
| **[B4DL: A Benchmark for 4D LiDAR LLM in Spatio-Temporal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05269v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in dynamic outdoor environments. We provide rendered 4D LiDAR videos, generated dataset, and inference outputs on diverse scenarios at: https://mmb4dl.github.io/mmb4dl/</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Robust Spatio-Temporal Distributional Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05041v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by investigating spatio-temporal patterns of the distribution of continuous variables, we consider describing the conditional distribution function of the response variable incorporating spatio-temporal components given predictors. In many applications, continuous variables are observed only as threshold-categorized data due to measurement constraints. For instance, ecological measurements often categorize sizes into intervals rather than recording exact values due to practical limitations. To recover the conditional distribution function of the underlying continuous variables, we consider a distribution regression employing models for binomial data obtained at each threshold value. However, depending on spatio-temporal conditions and predictors, the distribution function may frequently exhibit boundary values (zero or one), which can occur either structurally or randomly. This makes standard binomial models inadequate, requiring more flexible modeling approaches. To address this issue, we propose a boundary-inflated binomial model incorporating spatio-temporal components. The model is a three-component mixture of the binomial model and two Dirac measures at zero and one. We develop a computationally efficient Bayesian inference algorithm using P\'olya-Gamma data augmentation and dynamic Gaussian predictive processes. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our procedure significantly outperforms distribution regression methods based on standard binomial models across various scenarios.</p></details> | 29 pages, 1 figure |
| **[STARFormer: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Reorganization Transformer of FMRI for Brain Disorder Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00378v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many existing methods that use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) classify brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), often overlook the integration of spatial and temporal dependencies of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which may lead to inaccurate or imprecise classification results. To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research.

| **[UltraSTF: Ultra-Compact Model for Large-Scale Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20634v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal data, prevalent in real-world applications such as traffic monitoring, financial transactions, and ride-share demands, represents a specialized case of multivariate time series characterized by high dimensionality. This high dimensionality necessitates computationally efficient models and benefits from applying univariate forecasting approaches through channel-independent strategies. SparseTSF, a recently proposed competitive univariate forecasting model, leverages periodicity to achieve compactness by focusing on cross-period dynamics, extending the Pareto frontier in terms of model size and predictive performance. However, it underperforms on spatio-temporal data due to limited capture of intra-period temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose UltraSTF, which integrates a cross-period forecasting component with an ultra-compact shape bank component. Our model efficiently captures recurring patterns in time series using the attention mechanism of the shape bank component, significantly enhancing its capability to learn intra-period dynamics. UltraSTF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LargeST benchmark while utilizing fewer than 0.2% of the parameters required by the second-best methods, thereby further extending the Pareto frontier of existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

The architecture, called STARE (Spatio-Temporal Attention Representation for Eye Tracking), uses a new tokenization strategy, which involves mapping the x- and y- pixel coordinates of eye-movement time series on predefined, contiguous Regions of Interest. That tokenization makes the spatio-temporal eye-movement data available to the Chronos, a time-series foundation model based on the T5 architecture, to which co-attention and/or cross-attention is added to capture directional and/or interocular influences of eye movements. We compare STARE with several state-of-the art alternatives on multiple datasets with the purpose of predicting consumer choice behaviors from eye movements. We thus make a first step towards developing and testing DL architectures that represent visual attention dynamics rooted in the neurophysiology of eye movements.</p></details> |  |

Prior work primarily focuses on single-frame cooperative perception, which fuses agents' information across different spatial locations but ignores temporal cues and temporal tasks (e.g., temporal perception and prediction). In this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal fusion in V2X scenarios and design one-step and multi-step communication strategies (when to transmit) as well as examine their integration with three fusion strategies - early, late, and intermediate (what to transmit), providing comprehensive benchmarks with 11 fusion models (how to fuse). Furthermore, we propose V2XPnP, a novel intermediate fusion framework within one-step communication for end-to-end perception and prediction. Our framework employs a unified Transformer-based architecture to effectively model complex spatio-temporal relationships across multiple agents, frames, and high-definition maps. Moreover, we introduce the V2XPnP Sequential Dataset that supports all V2X collaboration modes and addresses the limitations of existing real-world datasets, which are restricted to single-frame or single-mode cooperation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perception and prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Website link: https://mobility-lab.seas.ucla.edu/v2xpnp/</p></details> |

It supports governmental efforts, particularly those led by the international telecommunication union (ITU), to establish fair spectrum allocation policies, improve auction mechanisms, and meet the requirements of emerging technologies such as advanced 5G, forthcoming 6G, and the internet of things (IoT). This paper presents an effective spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages crowdsourced user-side key performance indicators (KPIs) and regulatory datasets to model and forecast spectrum demand. The proposed methodology achieves superior prediction accuracy and cross-regional generalizability by incorporating advanced feature engineering, comprehensive correlation analysis, and transfer learning techniques. Unlike traditional ITU models, which are often constrained by arbitrary inputs and unrealistic assumptions, this approach exploits granular, data-driven insights to account for spatial and temporal variations in spectrum utilization. Comparative evaluations against ITU estimates, as the benchmark, underscore our framework's capability to deliver more realistic and actionable predictions. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our methodology, highlighting its potential as a robust approach for policymakers and regulatory bodies to enhance spectrum management and planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be presented at IEEE PIMRC 2025</p></details> |

With the rapid advancements in virtual/augmented reality, metaverse, and generative artificial intelligence, the demand for high-quality ODVs is surging. However, ODVs often suffer from low resolution due to their wide field of view and limitations in capturing devices and transmission bandwidth. Although video super-resolution (SR) is a capable video quality enhancement technique, the performance ceiling and practical generalization of existing methods are limited when applied to ODVs due to their unique attributes. To alleviate spatial projection distortions and temporal flickering of ODVs, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) with joint spatio-temporal alignment and reconstruction. Specifically, we incorporate a spatio-temporal continuous alignment (STCA) to mitigate discrete geometric artifacts in parallel with temporal alignment. Subsequently, we introduce an interlaced multi-frame reconstruction (IMFR) to enhance temporal consistency. Furthermore, we employ latitude-saliency adaptive (LSA) weights to focus on regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. By exploring a spatio-temporal jointly framework and real-world viewing strategies, STDAN effectively reinforces spatio-temporal coherence on a novel ODV-SR dataset and ensures affordable computational costs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that STDAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in improving visual fidelity and dynamic smoothness of ODVs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Forgetting and Spatio-Temporal Periodic Interest Modeling for Local-Life Service Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02451v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of the booming digital economy, recommendation systems, as a key link connecting users and numerous services, face challenges in modeling user behavior sequences on local-life service platforms, including the sparsity of long sequences and strong spatio-temporal dependence. Such challenges can be addressed by drawing an analogy to the forgetting process in human memory. This is because users' responses to recommended content follow the recency effect and the cyclicality of memory. By exploring this, this paper introduces the forgetting curve and proposes Spatio-Temporal periodic Interest Modeling (STIM) with long sequences for local-life service recommendation. STIM integrates three key components: a dynamic masking module based on the forgetting curve, which is used to extract both recent spatiotemporal features and periodic spatiotemporal features; a query-based mixture of experts (MoE) approach that can adaptively activate expert networks under different dynamic masks, enabling the collaborative modeling of time, location, and items; and a hierarchical multi-interest network unit, which captures multi-interest representations by modeling the hierarchical interactions between the shallow and deep semantics of users' recent behaviors. By introducing the STIM method, we conducted online A/B tests and achieved a 1.54\% improvement in gross transaction volume (GTV). In addition, extended offline experiments also showed improvements. STIM has been deployed in a large-scale local-life service recommendation system, serving hundreds of millions of daily active users in core application scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The key of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art results. Code will be available.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Continuous Network for Stochastic 3D Human Motion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01585v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields, existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition, the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution (GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

In order to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and enhance informed decision-making, a flexible model capable of accommodating extremes is necessary. Existing dynamic spatio-temporal statistical models exhibit limitations in capturing extremes when assuming Gaussian error distributions, whereas the current models for spatial extremes mostly assume temporal independence and are focused on joint upper tails at two or more locations. Here, we introduce a new class of dynamic spatio-temporal models that capture both high and low extremes using a mixture of heavy- and light-tailed distributions with varying tail indices. Our framework flexibly identifies extremal dependence and independence in both space and time with uncertainty quantification and supports missing data prediction, as in other dynamic spatio-temporal models. We demonstrate its effectiveness using a large reanalysis dataset of hourly particulate matter in the Central United States.</p></details> |  |
| **[Point-wise Diffusion Models for Physical Systems with Shape Variations: Application to Spatio-temporal and Large-scale system](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01230v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a novel point-wise diffusion model that processes spatio-temporal points independently to efficiently predict complex physical systems with shape variations. This methodological contribution lies in applying forward and backward diffusion processes at individual spatio-temporal points, coupled with a point-wise diffusion transformer architecture for denoising. Unlike conventional image-based diffusion models that operate on structured data representations, this framework enables direct processing of any data formats including meshes and point clouds while preserving geometric fidelity. We validate our approach across three distinct physical domains with complex geometric configurations: 2D spatio-temporal systems including cylinder fluid flow and OLED drop impact test, and 3D large-scale system for road-car external aerodynamics. To justify the necessity of our point-wise approach for real-time prediction applications, we employ denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) for efficient deterministic sampling, requiring only 5-10 steps compared to traditional 1000-step and providing computational speedup of 100 to 200 times during inference without compromising accuracy. In addition, our proposed model achieves superior performance compared to image-based diffusion model: reducing training time by 94.4% and requiring 89.0% fewer parameters while achieving over 28% improvement in prediction accuracy. Comprehensive comparisons against data-flexible surrogate models including DeepONet and Meshgraphnet demonstrate consistent superiority of our approach across all three physical systems. To further refine the proposed model, we investigate two key aspects: 1) comparison of final physical states prediction or incremental change prediction, and 2) computational efficiency evaluation across varying subsampling ratios (10%-100%).</p></details> |  |

Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a 5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks.

However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally, the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2 datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23447v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS), the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However, a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network (HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1) spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .</p></details> |  |

A valuable approach to studying them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions. One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism. Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and 31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 2025 International Conference on Machine Intelligence for GeoAnalytics and Remote Sensing (MIGARS)</p></details> |
| **[Multivariate Spatio-temporal Modelling for Completing Cancer Registries and Forecasting Incidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21714v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer data, particularly cancer incidence and mortality, are fundamental to understand the cancer burden, to set targets for cancer control and to evaluate the evolution of the implementation of a cancer control policy. However, the complexity of data collection, classification, validation and processing result in cancer incidence figures often lagging two to three years behind the calendar year. In response, national or regional population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) are increasingly interested in methods for forecasting cancer incidence. However, in many countries there is an additional difficulty in projecting cancer incidence as regional registries are usually not established in the same year and therefore cancer incidence data series between different regions of a country are not harmonised over time. This study addresses the challenge of forecasting cancer incidence with incomplete data at both regional and national levels. To achieve our objective, we propose the use of multivariate spatio-temporal shared component models that jointly model mortality data and available cancer incidence data. The performance of these multivariate models are analyzed using lung cancer incidence data, together with the number of deaths reported in England in the period 2001-2019. Different model predictive measures have been calculated to select the best model.</p></details> | 36 pages |

However, these box annotations require tremendous human effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named \textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations. Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker} surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively.

Buildings with similar features often share energy patterns, reflected by spatial dependencies in their operational data, which conventional prediction methods struggle to capture. To overcome this, we propose a multi-building prediction approach using spatio-temporal graph neural networks, comprising graph representation, graph learning, and interpretation. First, a graph is built based on building characteristics and environmental factors. Next, a multi-level graph convolutional architecture with attention is developed for energy prediction. Lastly, a method interpreting the optimized graph structure is introduced. Experiments on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset confirm superior performance over baselines such as XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, and Naive, highlighting the method's robustness, generalization, and interpretability in capturing meaningful building similarities and spatial relationships.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often struggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial, temporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this study, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware attention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike conventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal traffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based framework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and recall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within the South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic accident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78, and ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in identifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time, safety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based architecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing factors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, STARN-GAT bridges the gap between advanced graph neural network techniques and practical applications in road safety analytics.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task. This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task.

| **[Bridging Sequential Deep Operator Network and Video Diffusion: Residual Refinement of Spatio-Temporal PDE Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06133v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity. Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.</p></details> |  |
| **[IntentVCNet: Bridging Spatio-Temporal Gaps for Intention-Oriented Controllable Video Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18531v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent. Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically, we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge.

| **[INLA-RF: A Hybrid Modeling Strategy for Spatio-Temporal Environmental Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18488v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environmental processes often exhibit complex, non-linear patterns and discontinuities across space and time, posing significant challenges for traditional geostatistical modeling approaches. In this paper, we propose a hybrid spatio-temporal modeling framework that combines the interpretability and uncertainty quantification of Bayesian models -- estimated using the INLA-SPDE approach -- with the predictive power and flexibility of Random Forest (RF). Specifically, we introduce two novel algorithms, collectively named INLA-RF, which integrate a statistical spatio-temporal model with RF in an iterative two-stage framework. The first algorithm (INLA-RF1) incorporates RF predictions as an offset in the INLA-SPDE model, while the second (INLA-RF2) uses RF to directly correct selected latent field nodes. Both hybrid strategies enable uncertainty propagation between modeling stages, an aspect often overlooked in existing hybrid approaches. In addition, we propose a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based stopping criterion. We evaluate the predictive performance and uncertainty quantification capabilities of the proposed algorithms through two simulation studies. Results suggest that our hybrid approach enhances spatio-temporal prediction while maintaining interpretability and coherence in uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSDM: LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model for Service-Level Mobile Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17795v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model (LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions, showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least 8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at: https://github.com/SoftYuaneR/LSDM.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |

We propose COMPASS, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables decentralized agents to persistently monitor multiple moving targets efficiently. We model the environment as a graph, where nodes represent spatial locations and edges capture topological proximity, allowing agents to reason over structured layouts and revisit informative regions as needed. Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical observations and spatial context. We model target dynamics using Gaussian Processes (GPs), which support principled belief updates and enable uncertainty-aware planning. We train COMPASS using centralized value estimation and decentralized policy execution under an adaptive reward setting. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that COMPASS consistently outperforms strong baselines in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination efficiency across dynamic multi-target scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Default GPU memory allocators of popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch use online strategies without knowledge of tensor lifespans, which can waste up to 43\% of memory and cause out-of-memory errors, rendering optimization techniques ineffective or even unusable. To address this, we introduce STWeaver, a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads. STWeaver introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a pluggable PyTorch allocator, STWeaver reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 79.2\% (up to 100\%) across both dense and sparse models, with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and improves performance by up to 32.5\%.</p></details> |  |

Modeling and monitoring MAS requirements to guarantee overall mission objectives, safety, and reliability is an important problem. Such requirements implicitly require reasoning about diverse sensing and communication modalities between agents, analysis of the dependencies between agent tasks, and the spatial or virtual distance between agents. To capture such rich MAS requirements, we model agent interactions via multiple directed graphs, and introduce a new logic -- Spatio-Temporal Logic with Graph Operators (STL-GO). The key innovation in STL-GO are graph operators that enable us to reason about the number of agents along either the incoming or outgoing edges of the underlying interaction graph that satisfy a given property of interest; for example, the requirement that an agent should sense at least two neighboring agents whose task graphs indicate the ability to collaborate. We then propose novel distributed monitoring conditions for individual agents that use only local information to determine whether or not an STL-GO specification is satisfied. We compare the expressivity of STL-GO against existing spatio-temporal logic formalisms, and demonstrate the utility of STL-GO and our distributed monitors in a bike-sharing and a multi-drone case study.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods rely on binary classifiers trained using real and fake image sequences, therefore hindering their generalization capabilities to unseen generation methods. Moreover, with the constant progress in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), deepfake artifacts are becoming imperceptible at both the spatial and the temporal levels, making them extremely difficult to capture. To address these issues, we propose a fine-grained deepfake video detection approach called FakeSTormer that enforces the modeling of subtle spatio-temporal inconsistencies while avoiding overfitting. Specifically, we introduce a multi-task learning framework that incorporates two auxiliary branches for explicitly attending artifact-prone spatial and temporal regions. Additionally, we propose a video-level data synthesis strategy that generates pseudo-fake videos with subtle spatio-temporal artifacts, providing high-quality samples and hand-free annotations for our additional branches. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

While 3D CNNs have been effective at capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this, we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance. We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR). Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical solution for real-time HAR applications.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Previous methods solve the issue of insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing approaches.

This limits their representational alignment with the potentially diverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in domains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static relational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous inter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where different channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by entirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the attention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with dynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where each token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise interactions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per interaction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique relational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction for that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime attention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in MTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard attention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently outperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\% improvement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention achieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\% less sequence length compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior relational modeling capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Conversations can be balanced, with each speaker claiming a similar amount of talk-time, or imbalanced when one talks disproportionately. Such overall distributions are the consequence of continuous negotiations between the speakers throughout the conversation: who should be talking at every point in time, and for how long? In this work we introduce a computational framework for quantifying both the conversation-level distribution of talk-time between speakers, as well as the lower-level dynamics that lead to it. We derive a typology of talk-time sharing dynamics structured by several intuitive axes of variation. By applying this framework to a large dataset of video-chats between strangers, we confirm that, perhaps unsurprisingly, different conversation-level distributions of talk-time are perceived differently by speakers, with balanced conversations being preferred over imbalanced ones, especially by those who end up talking less. Then we reveal that -- even when they lead to the same level of overall balance -- different types of talk-time sharing dynamics are perceived differently by the participants, highlighting the relevance of our newly introduced typology. Finally, we discuss how our framework offers new tools to designers of computer-mediated communication platforms, for both human-human and human-AI communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at CSCW 2025.

| **[A Time-Series Foundation Model by Universal Delay Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12080v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces Universal Delay Embedding (UDE), a pretrained foundation model designed to revolutionize time-series forecasting through principled integration of delay embedding representation and Koopman operator prediction. Leveraging Takens' embedding theorem, UDE as a dynamical representation of observed data constructs two-dimensional subspace patches from Hankel matrices, theoretically preserving dynamical and topological properties of underlying dynamical systems. Such patches are viewed as images, which can be efficiently processed by exploiting advanced deep learning technologies. Computationally, these patches further serve as tokens for learning a self-attention encoder, thus enabling accurate prediction of nonlinear time-series by a finite-dimensional Koopman operator in a linear manner in a latent space. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks and real-world climate datasets demonstrate over 20% average reduction in mean squared error versus state-of-the-art foundation models, alongside superior generalization in fine-tuning scenarios. In particular, the learned dynamical representations and Koopman operator prediction forms from the patches exhibit exceptional interpretability, with consistent identification of topologically informative subspaces and robust encoding of domain-invariant dynamics, establishing UDE as a scalable, interpretable framework for universal time-series modeling and forecasting with broad scientific and industrial applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Travel Time and Weather-Aware Traffic Forecasting in a Conformal Graph Neural Network Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12043v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic flow forecasting is essential for managing congestion, improving safety, and optimizing various transportation systems. However, it remains a prevailing challenge due to the stochastic nature of urban traffic and environmental factors. Better predictions require models capable of accommodating the traffic variability influenced by multiple dynamic and complex interdependent factors. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to address the stochasticity by leveraging adaptive adjacency matrices using log-normal distributions and Coefficient of Variation (CV) values to reflect real-world travel time variability. Additionally, weather factors such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation adjust edge weights and enable GNN to capture evolving spatio-temporal dependencies across traffic stations. This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to adapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, we utilize the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP) framework to provide reliable uncertainty quantification, achieving target coverage while maintaining acceptable prediction intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model, in comparison with baseline methods, showed better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds. We, then, validate this method by constructing traffic scenarios in SUMO and applying Monte-Carlo simulation to derive a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under Test (VUT) to reflect real-world variability. The simulated mean travel time of the VUT falls within the intervals defined by INRIX historical data, verifying the model's robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted as a REGULAR PAPER in the Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we examine this through the lens of multi-robot patrol, by presenting a machine learning-based adversary model that observes robot patrol behavior in order to attempt to gain undetected access to a secure environment within a limited time duration. Such a model allows for evaluation of a patrol system against a realistic potential adversary, offering insight into future patrol strategy design. We show that our new model outperforms existing baselines, thus providing a more stringent test, and examine its performance against multiple leading decentralized multi-robot patrol strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive least-squares space-time finite element methods for convection-diffusion problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11955v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we formulate and analyse adaptive (space-time) least-squares finite element methods for the solution of convection-diffusion equations. The convective derivative $\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla u$ is considered as part of the total time derivative $\frac{d}{dt}u = \partial_t u + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla u$, and therefore we can use a rather standard stability and error analysis for related space-time finite element methods. For stationary problems we restrict the ansatz space $H^1_0(\Omega)$ such that the convective derivative is considered as an element of the dual $H^{-1}(\Omega)$ of the test space $H^1_0(\Omega)$, which also allows unbounded velocities $\mathbf{v}$. While the discrete finite element schemes are always unique solvable, the numerical solutions may suffer from a bad approximation property of the finite element space when considering convection dominated problems, i.e., small diffusion coefficients. Instead of adding suitable stabilization terms, we aim to resolve the solutions by using adaptive (space-time) finite element methods. For this we introduce a least-squares approach where the discrete adjoint defines local a posteriori error indicators to drive an adaptive scheme. Numerical examples illustrate the theoretical considerations.</p></details> |  |

This is a particular challenge in settings with strict pre-defined space constraints. In this paper, we examine the combined space-time complexity of conjunctive queries (CQs) and, more generally, of sum-product queries (SPQs). We propose several classes of space-efficient algorithms for evaluating SPQs, and we show that the optimal time complexity is almost always achievable with asymptotically lower space complexity than traditional approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAM-TTT: Segment Anything Model via Reverse Parameter Configuration and Test-Time Training for Camouflaged Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11884v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a new Segment Anything Model (SAM) that leverages reverse parameter configuration and test-time training to enhance its performance on Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), named SAM-TTT. While most existing SAM-based COD models primarily focus on enhancing SAM by extracting favorable features and amplifying its advantageous parameters, a crucial gap is identified: insufficient attention to adverse parameters that impair SAM's semantic understanding in downstream tasks. To tackle this issue, the Reverse SAM Parameter Configuration Module is proposed to effectively mitigate the influence of adverse parameters in a train-free manner by configuring SAM's parameters. Building on this foundation, the T-Visioner Module is unveiled to strengthen advantageous parameters by integrating Test-Time Training layers, originally developed for language tasks, into vision tasks. Test-Time Training layers represent a new class of sequence modeling layers characterized by linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. By integrating two modules, SAM-TTT simultaneously suppresses adverse parameters while reinforcing advantageous ones, significantly improving SAM's semantic understanding in COD task. Our experimental results on various COD benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting a new benchmark in the field. The code will be available at https://github.com/guobaoxiao/SAM-TTT.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ACM MM 25</p></details> |
| **[TemporalFED: Detecting Cyberattacks in Industrial Time-Series Data Using Decentralized Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03554v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industry 4.0 has brought numerous advantages, such as increasing productivity through automation. However, it also presents major cybersecurity issues such as cyberattacks affecting industrial processes. Federated Learning (FL) combined with time-series analysis is a promising cyberattack detection mechanism proposed in the literature. However, the fact of having a single point of failure and network bottleneck are critical challenges that need to be tackled. Thus, this article explores the benefits of the Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) in terms of cyberattack detection and resource consumption. The work presents TemporalFED, a software module for detecting anomalies in industrial environments using FL paradigms and time series. TemporalFED incorporates three components: Time Series Conversion, Feature Engineering, and Time Series Stationary Conversion. To evaluate TemporalFED, it was deployed on Fedstellar, a DFL framework. Then, a pool of experiments measured the detection performance and resource consumption in a chemical gas industrial environment with different time-series configurations, FL paradigms, and topologies. The results showcase the superiority of the configuration utilizing DFL and Semi-Decentralized Federated Learning (SDFL) paradigms, along with a fully connected topology, which achieved the best performance in anomaly detection. Regarding resource consumption, the configuration without feature engineering employed less bandwidth, CPU, and RAM than other configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Based State-Management of Hash-Based Signature CAs for VPN-Authentication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11695v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in quantum computing necessitate migrating the entire technology stack to post-quantum cryptography. This includes IPsec-based VPN connection authentication. Although there is an RFC draft for post-quantum authentication in this setting, the draft does not consider (stateful) hash-based signatures despite their small signature size and trusted long-term security. We propose a design with time-based state-management that assigns VPN devices a certificate authority (CA) based on the hash-based signature scheme XMSS. The CA then issues leaf certificates which are based on classical cryptography but have a short validity time, e. g., four hours. It is to be expected that even large quantum computers will take significantly longer to break the cryptography, making the design quantum-secure. We propose strategies to make the timekeeping more resilient to faults and tampering, as well as strategies to recognize a wrong system time, minimize its potential damage, and quickly recover. The result is an OpenBSD implementation of a quantum-safe and, regarding the leaf certificates, highly flexible VPN authentication design that requires significantly less bandwidth and computational resources compared to existing alternatives.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |
| **[An Interventional Approach to Real-Time Disaster Assessment via Causal Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11676v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional disaster analysis and modelling tools for assessing the severity of a disaster are predictive in nature. Based on the past observational data, these tools prescribe how the current input state (e.g., environmental conditions, situation reports) results in a severity assessment. However, these systems are not meant to be interventional in the causal sense, where the user can modify the current input state to simulate counterfactual "what-if" scenarios. In this work, we provide an alternative interventional tool that complements traditional disaster modelling tools by leveraging real-time data sources like satellite imagery, news, and social media. Our tool also helps understand the causal attribution of different factors on the estimated severity, over any given region of interest. In addition, we provide actionable recourses that would enable easier mitigation planning. Our source code is publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Select2Drive: Pragmatic Communications for Real-Time Collaborative Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12040v4)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle-to-everything communications-assisted autonomous driving has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, with pragmatic communications (PragComm) emerging as a promising paradigm for real-time collaboration among vehicles and other agents. Simultaneously, extensive research has explored the interplay between collaborative perception and decision-making in end-to-end driving frameworks. In this work, we revisit the collaborative driving problem and propose the Select2Drive framework to optimize the utilization of limited computational and communication resources. Particularly, to mitigate cumulative latency in perception and decision-making, Select2Drive introduces distributed predictive perception by formulating an active prediction paradigm and simplifying high-dimensional semantic feature prediction into a computation cost-efficient, motion-aware reconstruction. Given the ``less is more" principle that an over-broadened perceptual horizon possibly confuses the decision module rather than contributing to it, Select2Drive utilizes area-of-importance-based PragComm to prioritize the communications of critical regions, thus boosting both communication efficiency and decision-making efficacy. Empirical evaluations on the V2Xverse and real-world DAIR-V2X demonstrate that Select2Drive achieves a $2.60$\% and $1.99$\% improvement in offline perception tasks under limited bandwidth (resp., pose error conditions). Moreover, it delivers at most $8.35$\% and $2.65$\% enhancement in closed-loop driving scores and route completion rates, particularly in scenarios characterized by dense traffic and high-speed dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time Photorealistic Mapping for Situational Awareness in Robot Teleoperation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06433v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving efficient remote teleoperation is particularly challenging in unknown environments, as the teleoperator must rapidly build an understanding of the site's layout. Online 3D mapping is a proven strategy to tackle this challenge, as it enables the teleoperator to progressively explore the site from multiple perspectives. However, traditional online map-based teleoperation systems struggle to generate visually accurate 3D maps in real-time due to the high computational cost involved, leading to poor teleoperation performances. In this work, we propose a solution to improve teleoperation efficiency in unknown environments. Our approach proposes a novel, modular and efficient GPU-based integration between recent advancement in gaussian splatting SLAM and existing online map-based teleoperation systems. We compare the proposed solution against state-of-the-art teleoperation systems and validate its performances through real-world experiments using an aerial vehicle. The results show significant improvements in decision-making speed and more accurate interaction with the environment, leading to greater teleoperation efficiency. In doing so, our system enhances remote teleoperation by seamlessly integrating photorealistic mapping generation with real-time performances, enabling effective teleoperation in unfamiliar environments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches struggle with scalability, probabilistic interpretability, and adaptability to evolving traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH, a lightweight and scalable framework for real-time anomaly detection in streaming edge data. Our method integrates temporal multi-tensor sketching with Count-Min Sketch using Conservative Update (CMS-CU) to compactly track edge frequency patterns with bounded memory, while mitigating hash collision issues. We incorporate Bayesian inference for probabilistic anomaly scoring and apply Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) for adaptive thresholding tuned to burst intensity. Extensive experiments on four real-world intrusion detection datasets demonstrate that ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as ANOEDGE-G/L, MIDAS-R, and F-FADE, achieving up to 6.5% AUC gain on CIC-IDS2018 and up to 15.6% on CIC-DDoS2019, while processing 20 million edges in under 3.4 seconds using only 10 hash functions. Our results show that ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH is practical and effective for fast, accurate anomaly detection in large-scale streaming graphs.

| **[Inducing Uncertainty for Test-Time Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11625v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlearning is the predominant method for removing the influence of data in machine learning models. However, even after unlearning, models often continue to produce the same predictions on the unlearned data with high confidence. This persistent behavior can be exploited by adversaries using confident model predictions on incorrect or obsolete data to harm users. We call this threat model, which unlearning fails to protect against, *test-time privacy*. In particular, an adversary with full model access can bypass any naive defenses which ensure test-time privacy. To address this threat, we introduce an algorithm which perturbs model weights to induce maximal uncertainty on protected instances while preserving accuracy on the rest of the instances. Our core algorithm is based on finetuning with a Pareto optimal objective that explicitly balances test-time privacy against utility. We also provide a certifiable approximation algorithm which achieves $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ guarantees without convexity assumptions. We then prove a tight, non-vacuous bound that characterizes the privacy-utility tradeoff that our algorithms incur. Empirically, our method obtains $>3\times$ stronger uncertainty than pretraining with $<0.2\%$ drops in accuracy on various image recognition benchmarks. Altogether, this framework provides a tool to guarantee additional protection to end users.</p></details> |  |

While prior work predicts what actions users perform, the timing of these actions -- critical for enabling proactive and efficient smart systems -- remains relatively underexplored. Addressing this gap, we focus on predicting the time of the next user action in smart environments. Due to the lack of public datasets with fine-grained timestamps suitable for this task and associated privacy concerns, we contribute a dataset of 11.6k sequences synthesized based on human annotations of interaction patterns, pairing actions with precise timestamps. To this end, we introduce Timing-Matters, a Transformer-Encoder based method that predicts action timing, achieving 38.30% accuracy on the synthesized dataset, outperforming the best baseline by 6%, and showing 1--6% improvements on other open datasets. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages + 1 reference, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This survey defines the problem and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling, tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey). Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty, grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable evidence and credible outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |

Exposure to air pollutants such as PM$_{10}$ $\mu$m, NO$_2$, and SO$_2$ has been associated with the worsening of these diseases, especially in urban areas. This study evaluated the association between the daily concentration of these pollutants and daily hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular diseases in S\~ao Paulo (2010-2019), using generalized additive models with a lag of 0 to 4 days. Two approaches for choosing the degrees of freedom in temporal smoothing were compared: based on pollutant prediction and based on outcome prediction (hospitalizations). Data were obtained from official government databases. The modeling used the quasi-Poisson family in R software (v. 4.4.0). Models with exposure-based smoothing generated more consistent estimates. For PM10{\mu}m, the cumulative risk estimate for exposure was 1.08%, while for hospitalization, it was 1.20%. For NO$_2$, the estimated risk was 1.47% (exposure) versus 1.33% (hospitalization). For SO$_2$, a striking difference was observed: 7.66% (exposure) versus 14.31% (hospitalization). The significant lags were on days 0, 1, and 2. The results show that smoothing based on outcome prediction can generate bias, masking the true effect of pollutants. The appropriate choice of df in the smoothing function is crucial. Smoothing by the pollutant series was more robust and accurate, contributing to methodological improvements in time-series studies and reinforcing the importance of public policies for pollution control.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages with 4 figures</p></details> |

While existing defense methods offer partial protection, they face critical limitations, including weak adaptability to unseen user data, poor scalability to long audio, rigid reliance on white-box knowledge, and high computational and temporal costs during the encryption process. To address these challenges and defend against personalized voice deepfake threats, we propose Enkidu, a novel user-oriented privacy-preserving framework that leverages universal frequential perturbations generated through black-box knowledge and few-shot training on a small amount of user data. These highly malleable frequency-domain noise patches enable real-time, lightweight protection with strong generalization across variable-length audio and robust resistance to voice deepfake attacks, all while preserving perceptual quality and speech intelligibility. Notably, Enkidu achieves over 50 to 200 times processing memory efficiency (as low as 0.004 gigabytes) and 3 to 7000 times runtime efficiency (real-time coefficient as low as 0.004) compared to six state-of-the-art countermeasures. Extensive experiments across six mainstream text-to-speech models and five cutting-edge automated speaker verification models demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, and practicality of Enkidu in defending against both vanilla and adaptive voice deepfake attacks.

| **[Long-time dynamics and universality of nonconvex gradient descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11426v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a general approach to characterize the long-time trajectory behavior of nonconvex gradient descent in generalized single-index models in the large aspect ratio regime. In this regime, we show that for each iteration the gradient descent iterate concentrates around a deterministic vector called the `Gaussian theoretical gradient descent', whose dynamics can be tracked by a state evolution system of two recursive equations for two scalars. Our concentration guarantees hold universally for a broad class of design matrices and remain valid over long time horizons until algorithmic convergence or divergence occurs. Moreover, our approach reveals that gradient descent iterates are in general approximately independent of the data and strongly incoherent with the feature vectors, a phenomenon previously known as the `implicit regularization' effect of gradient descent in specific models under Gaussian data. As an illustration of the utility of our general theory, we present two applications of different natures in the regression setting. In the first, we prove global convergence of nonconvex gradient descent with general independent initialization for a broad class of structured link functions, and establish universality of randomly initialized gradient descent in phase retrieval for large aspect ratios. In the second, we develop a data-free iterative algorithm for estimating state evolution parameters along the entire gradient descent trajectory, thereby providing a low-cost yet statistically valid tool for practical tasks such as hyperparameter tuning and runtime determination. As a by-product of our analysis, we show that in the large aspect ratio regime, the Gaussian theoretical gradient descent coincides with a recent line of dynamical mean-field theory for gradient descent over the constant-time horizon.</p></details> |  |

This study presents a novel integrated framework combining state-of-the-art large language models (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with advanced prompt engineering techniques and multimodal data fusion for comprehensive reservoir analysis. The framework implements domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with over 50,000 petroleum engineering documents, chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot learning for rapid field adaptation. Multimodal integration processes seismic interpretations, well logs, and production data through specialized AI models with vision transformers. Field validation across 15 diverse reservoir environments demonstrates exceptional performance: 94.2% reservoir characterization accuracy, 87.6% production forecasting precision, and 91.4% well placement optimization success rate. The system achieves sub-second response times while maintaining 96.2% safety reliability with no high-risk incidents during evaluation. Economic analysis reveals 62-78% cost reductions (mean 72%) relative to traditional methods with 8-month payback period. Few-shot learning reduces field adaptation time by 72%, while automated prompt optimization achieves 89% improvement in reasoning quality. The framework processed real-time data streams with 96.2% anomaly detection accuracy and reduced environmental incidents by 45%. We provide detailed experimental protocols, baseline comparisons, ablation studies, and statistical significance testing to ensure reproducibility. This research demonstrates practical integration of cutting-edge AI technologies with petroleum domain expertise for enhanced operational efficiency, safety, and economic performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-varying Vine Copula model based on R-Vine structure and its application in financial risk research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11192v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The time-varying Vine Copula model has become a new direction in the Vine Copula class of models due to its time-varying structural parameters. We have observed that the Vine structures of the time-varying Vine Copula model currently used in economics and business research are C-Vine and D-Vine. These two structures are simpler than the R-Vine structure in modeling but will lose more details. Although truncation and simplification of the Vine structure are necessary when the number of variables is large, the number of variables in economics and business research is often small. Therefore, the R-Vine structure is definitely more suitable for constructing time-varying Vine Copula for economic research. Therefore, this paper uses the GAS (Generalized Autoregressive Score) model to dynamically parameterize the R-Vine structure to construct a time-varying Vine Copula model. The application of this model to the study of liquidity risks between China and Southeast Asian countries, including during the pandemic period, reveals that the time-varying model based on the R-Vine structure not only achieves better statistical test results but also better reflects economic and even political realities compared to the other two structural time-varying models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rumor Detection by Multi-task Suffix Learning based on Time-series Dual Sentiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14383v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread dissemination of rumors on social media has a significant impact on people's lives, potentially leading to public panic and fear. Rumors often evoke specific sentiments, resonating with readers and prompting sharing. To effectively detect and track rumors, it is essential to observe the fine-grained sentiments of both source and response message pairs as the rumor evolves over time. However, current rumor detection methods fail to account for this aspect. In this paper, we propose MSuf, the first multi-task suffix learning framework for rumor detection and tracking using time series dual (coupled) sentiments. MSuf includes three modules: (1) an LLM to extract sentiment intensity features and sort them chronologically; (2) a module that fuses the sorted sentiment features with their source text word embeddings to obtain an aligned embedding; (3) two hard prompts are combined with the aligned vector to perform rumor detection and sentiment analysis using one frozen LLM. MSuf effectively enhances the performance of LLMs for rumor detection with only minimal parameter fine-tuning. Evaluating MSuf on four rumor detection benchmarks, we find significant improvements compared to other emotion-based methods.</p></details> | work in progress |

The method achieves second-order accuracy in time and spectral accuracy in phase space, both of which are rigorously verified by numerical experiments. The validated scheme is then employed to study the long-time dynamics of these systems. We investigate the existence of steady states for both the Wigner-Fokker-Planck and Wigner-Poisson-Fokker-Planck equations. Notably, for the Wigner-Fokker-Planck system, our results provide numerical evidence for the existence of a steady state even when the external potential is far from harmonic. This is an important discovery, since this phenomenon has not been thoroughly established in theory.</p></details> |  |

While the studies have explained the meaning of magnitude from various perspectives, continuity also gives a valuable view of magnitude. Based on established results about continuity of magnitude and maximum diversity, this article focuses on continuity of weighting, a distribution whose totality is magnitude, and its variation corresponding to maximum diversity. Meanwhile, recent studies also illuminated the connection between magnitude and data analysis by applying magnitude theory to point clouds representing the data or the set of model parameters. This article will also provide an application for time series analysis by introducing a new kind of invariants of periodic time series, where the invariance follows directly from the continuity results.

A dual functional factor model structure is adopted with a high-dimensional factor model for the observed curve time series and a low-dimensional factor model for the latent curves with common trends. A functional PCA technique is applied to estimate the common stochastic trends and functional factor loadings. Under some regularity conditions we derive the mean square convergence and limit distribution theory for the developed estimates, allowing the dimension and sample size to jointly diverge to infinity. We propose an easy-to-implement criterion to consistently select the number of common stochastic trends and further discuss model estimation when the nonstationary factors are cointegrated. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations and two empirical applications to large-scale temperature curves in Australia and log-price curves of S&P 500 stocks are conducted, showing finite-sample performance and providing practical implementations of the new methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convergence Rate in Nonlinear Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation with State (Time)-Dependence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11039v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The nonlinear two-time-scale stochastic approximation is widely studied under conditions of bounded variances in noise. Motivated by recent advances that allow for variability linked to the current state or time, we consider state- and time-dependent noises. We show that the Lyapunov function exhibits polynomial convergence rates in both cases, with the rate of polynomial delay depending on the parameters of state- or time-dependent noises. Notably, if the state noise parameters fully approach their limiting value, the Lyapunov function achieves an exponential convergence rate. We provide two numerical examples to illustrate our theoretical findings in the context of stochastic gradient descent with Polyak-Ruppert averaging and stochastic bilevel optimization.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[Real-Time Defense Against Coordinated Cyber-Physical Attacks: A Robust Constrained Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10999v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern power systems face increasing vulnerability to sophisticated cyber-physical attacks beyond traditional N-1 contingency frameworks. Existing security paradigms face a critical bottleneck: efficiently identifying worst-case scenarios and rapidly coordinating defensive responses are hindered by intensive computation and time delays, during which cascading failures can propagate. This paper presents a novel tri-level robust constrained reinforcement learning (RCRL) framework for robust power system security. The framework generates diverse system states through AC-OPF formulations, identifies worst-case N-K attack scenarios for each state, and trains policies to mitigate these scenarios across all operating conditions without requiring predefined attack patterns. The framework addresses constraint satisfaction through Beta-blending projection-based feasible action mapping techniques during training and primal-dual augmented Lagrangian optimization for deployment. Once trained, the RCRL policy learns how to control observed cyber-physical attacks in real time. Validation on IEEE benchmark systems demonstrates effectiveness against coordinated N-K attacks, causing widespread cascading failures throughout the network. The learned policy can successfully respond rapidly to recover system-wide constraints back to normal within 0.21 ms inference times, establishing superior resilience for critical infrastructure protection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This study introduces a geometry-aware two-dimensional time-to-collision (2D-TTC) indicator within a Hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal grouped random parameter (HBSGRP) framework using a non-stationary univariate generalized extreme value (UGEV) model to estimate short-term COR in urban corridors. High-resolution trajectories from the Argoverse-2 dataset, covering 28 locations along Miami's Biscayne Boulevard, were analyzed to extract extreme V-V and V-I near misses. The model incorporates dynamic variables and roadway features as covariates, with partial pooling across locations to address unobserved heterogeneity. Results show that the HBSGRP-UGEV framework outperforms fixed-parameter alternatives, reducing DIC by up to 7.5% for V-V and 3.1% for V-I near-misses. Predictive validation using ROC-AUC confirms strong performance: 0.89 for V-V segments, 0.82 for V-V intersections, 0.79 for V-I segments, and 0.75 for V-I intersections. Model interpretation reveals that relative speed and distance dominate V-V risks at intersections and segments, with deceleration critical in segments, while V-I risks are driven by speed, boundary proximity, and steering/heading adjustments. These findings highlight the value of a statistically rigorous, geometry-sensitive, and spatially adaptive modeling approach for proactive corridor-level safety management, supporting real-time interventions and long-term design strategies aligned with Vision Zero.</p></details> | 13 figures, 8 Tables |
| **[Mechanics-Informed Machine Learning for Geospatial Modeling of Soil Liquefaction: Global and National Surrogate Models for Simulation and Near-Real-Time Response](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10962v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using machine learning (ML), high performance computing, and a large body of geospatial information, we develop surrogate models to predict soil liquefaction across regional scales. Two sets of models - one global and one specific to New Zealand - are trained by learning to mimic geotechnical models at the sites of in-situ tests. Our geospatial approach has conceptual advantages in that predictions: (i) are anchored to mechanics, which encourages more sensible response and scaling across the domains of soil, site, and loading characteristics; (ii) are driven by ML, which allows more predictive information to be used, with greater potential for it to be exploited; (iii) are geostatistically updated by subsurface data, which anchors the predictions to known conditions; and (iv) are precomputed everywhere on earth for all conceivable earthquakes, which allows the models to be executed very easily, thus encouraging user adoption and evaluation. Test applications suggest that: (i) the proposed models outperform others to a statistically significant degree; (ii) the geostatistical updating further improves performance; and (iii) the anticipated advantages of region-specific models may largely be negated by the benefits of learning from larger global datasets. These models are best suited for regional-scale liquefaction hazard simulation and near-real-time response and are accompanied by variance products that convey where, and to what degree, the ML-predicted liquefaction response is influenced by local geotechnical data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-Stage Least Squares Instrumental Variable Estimation for Semiparametric Accelerated Failure Time Models with Right-Censored Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10905v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instrumental variable (IV) analysis is widely used in fields such as economics and epidemiology to address unobserved confounding and measurement error when estimating the causal effects of intermediate covariates on outcomes. However, extending the commonly used two-stage least squares (TSLS) approach to survival settings is nontrivial due to censoring. This paper introduces a novel extension of TSLS to the semiparametric accelerated failure time (AFT) model with right-censored data, supported by rigorous theoretical justification. Specifically, we propose an iterative reweighted generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach that incorporates Leurgans' synthetic variable method, establish the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimator, and derive a consistent variance estimator, enabling valid causal inference. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed method across different scenarios. The results show that it outperforms the naive unweighted GEE method, a parametric IV approach, and a one-stage estimator without IV. The proposed method is also highly scalable to large datasets, achieving a 300- to 1500-fold speedup relative to a Bayesian parametric IV approach in both simulations and the real-data example. We further illustrate the utility of the proposed method through a real-data application using the UK Biobank data.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Search-TTA: A Multimodal Test-Time Adaptation Framework for Visual Search in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11350v2)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To perform outdoor autonomous visual navigation and search, a robot may leverage satellite imagery as a prior map. This can help inform high-level search and exploration strategies, even when such images lack sufficient resolution to allow for visual recognition of targets. However, there are limited training datasets of satellite images with annotated targets that are not directly visible. Furthermore, approaches which leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs) for generalization may yield inaccurate outputs due to hallucination, leading to inefficient search. To address these challenges, we introduce Search-TTA, a multimodal test-time adaptation framework with a flexible plug-and-play interface compatible with various input modalities (e.g. image, text, sound) and planning methods. First, we pretrain a satellite image encoder to align with CLIP's visual encoder to output probability distributions of target presence used for visual search. Second, our framework dynamically refines CLIP's predictions during search using a test-time adaptation mechanism. Through a novel feedback loop inspired by Spatial Poisson Point Processes, uncertainty-weighted gradient updates are used to correct potentially inaccurate predictions and improve search performance. To train and evaluate Search-TTA, we curate AVS-Bench, a visual search dataset based on internet-scale ecological data that contains up to 380k training and 8k validation images (in- and out-domain). We find that Search-TTA improves planner performance by up to 30.0%, particularly in cases with poor initial CLIP predictions due to limited training data. It also performs comparably with significantly larger VLMs, and achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen modalities. Finally, we deploy Search-TTA on a real UAV via hardware-in-the-loop testing, by simulating its operation within a large-scale simulation that provides onboard sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at CORL 2025</p></details> |

A computational perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10846v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The New York Times (NYT) games have found widespread popularity in recent years and reportedly account for an increasing fraction of the newspaper's readership. In this paper, we bring the computational lens to the study of New York Times games and consider four of them not previously studied: Letter Boxed, Pips, Strands and Tiles. We show that these games can be just as hard as they are fun. In particular, we characterize the hardness of several variants of computational problems related to these popular puzzle games. For Letter Boxed, we show that deciding whether an instance is solvable is in general NP-Complete, while in some parameter settings it can be done in polynomial time. Similarly, for Pips we prove that deciding whether a puzzle has a solution is NP-Complete even in some restricted classes of instances. We then show that one natural computational problem arising from Strands is NP-Complete in most parameter settings. Finally, we demonstrate that deciding whether a Tiles puzzle is solvable with a single, uninterrupted combo requires polynomial time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Branched Broomrape Detection in Tomato Farms Using Satellite Imagery and Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10804v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa (L.) Pomel) is a chlorophyll-deficient parasitic plant that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from the host, with reported yield losses up to 80 percent. Its mostly subterranean life cycle and prolific seed production (more than 200,000 seeds per plant, viable for up to 20 years) make early detection essential. We present an end-to-end pipeline that uses Sentinel-2 imagery and time-series analysis to identify broomrape-infested tomato fields in California. Regions of interest were defined from farmer-reported infestations, and images with less than 10 percent cloud cover were retained. We processed 12 spectral bands and sun-sensor geometry, computed 20 vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, NDMI), and derived five plant traits (Leaf Area Index, Leaf Chlorophyll Content, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, and Fractional Vegetation Cover) using a neural network calibrated with ground-truth and synthetic data. Trends in Canopy Chlorophyll Content delineated transplanting-to-harvest periods, and phenology was aligned using growing degree days. Vegetation pixels were segmented and used to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network on 18,874 pixels across 48 growing-degree-day time points. The model achieved 88 percent training accuracy and 87 percent test accuracy, with precision 0.86, recall 0.92, and F1 0.89. Permutation feature importance ranked NDMI, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, FAPAR, and a chlorophyll red-edge index as most informative, consistent with the physiological effects of infestation. Results show the promise of satellite-driven time-series modeling for scalable detection of parasitic stress in tomato farms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author-accepted version.

This is especially problematic in clinical contexts where patients are distressed and vulnerable, and require empathic communication to support safety, adherence, and trust. We present RECAP (Reflect-Extract-Calibrate-Align-Produce), an inference-time framework that adds structured emotional reasoning without retraining. By decomposing empathy into transparent appraisal-theoretic stages and exposing per-dimension Likert signals, RECAP produces nuanced, auditable responses. Across EmoBench, SECEU, and EQ-Bench, RECAP improves emotional reasoning by 22-28% on 8B models and 10-13% on larger models over zero-shot baselines. Clinician evaluations further confirm superior empathetic communication. RECAP shows that modular, theory-grounded prompting can systematically enhance emotional intelligence in medical AI while preserving the accountability required for deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Warmup for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10641v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold great promise for advanced reasoning at the intersection of text and images, yet they have not fully realized this potential. MLLMs typically integrate an LLM, a vision encoder, and a connector that maps the vision encoder's embeddings into the LLM's text embedding space. Although each component is pretrained on massive datasets with billions of samples, the entire multimodal model is typically trained on only thousands (or a few million) samples, which can result in weak performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these shortcomings, instead of relying on extensive labeled datasets for fine-tuning, we propose a Test-Time Warmup method that adapts the MLLM per test instance by leveraging data from weakly supervised auxiliary tasks. With our approach, we observe a relative performance improvement of 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA on the Llama-Vision-Instruct model. Our method demonstrates that 'warming up' before inference can enhance MLLMs' robustness across diverse reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing defenses are largely reactive, offering limited protection during active interactions. We propose a privacy-preserving, AI-in-the-loop framework that proactively detects and disrupts scam conversations in real time. The system combines instruction-tuned artificial intelligence with a safety-aware utility function that balances engagement with harm minimization, and employs federated learning to enable continual model updates without raw data sharing. Experimental evaluations show that the system produces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement $\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism, safety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models trained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement ($\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage ($\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain stable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing performance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3, MD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce the chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the model engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer and richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of higher privacy risk. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify real-time scam-baiting, federated privacy preservation, and calibrated safety moderation into a proactive defense paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper got accepted in 26th Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 2026).

Although their software relies on strict verification and validation processes following well-established best-practices and certification standards, anomalies can still occur at run-time due to residual faults, system and environmental modifications that were unknown at design-time, or other emergent cyber-threat scenarios. This paper explores run-time control-flow anomaly detection using process mining to enhance the resilience of ERTMS/ETCS L2 (European Rail Traffic Management System / European Train Control System Level 2). Process mining allows learning the actual control flow of the system from its execution traces, thus enabling run-time monitoring through online conformance checking. In addition, anomaly localization is performed through unsupervised machine learning to link relevant deviations to critical system components. We test our approach on a reference ERTMS/ETCS L2 scenario, namely the RBC/RBC Handover, to show its capability to detect and localize anomalies with high accuracy, efficiency, and explainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 6th International Conference on Reliability, Safety, and Security of Railway Systems (RSSRail2025)</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Semiparametric Joint Modeling of Gap-Time Distribution for Multitype Recurrent Events and a Terminal Event](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10354v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In biomedical settings, multitype recurrent events such as stroke and heart failure occur frequently, often concluding with a terminal event such as death. Understanding the links between these recurring and terminal events is fundamental to developing interventions that delay detrimental outcomes. Joint modeling is needed to quantify the dependence between event types and between recurrent events and mortality. We propose a Bayesian semiparametric joint model on the gap-time scale for multitype recurrent events and a terminal event. The model includes a shared frailty that links all recurrent types and the terminal event. Each baseline hazard is assigned a gamma-process prior, while regression and frailty parameters receive standard parametric priors. This ensures flexible baselines and familiar effect measures. The construction gives closed-form expressions for the cumulative hazard and frailty component and connects to Breslow-Aalen type estimators as a special case of our estimator, linking the Bayesian procedure to the classical approach. Computationally, we develop a simple MCMC sampler that avoids large matrix factorizations and scales nearly linearly in sample size. A comprehensive simulation evaluates four criteria: accuracy, prediction, robustness, and computation. There is no exact frequentist version of our specification; for comparison, we fit the same model with an EM algorithm in a frequentist framework. Our model and MCMC algorithm demonstrate superior performance on each criterion. We illustrate the approach with data from the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), jointly analyzing acute and chronic cardiovascular recurrences and death.</p></details> |  |

The proposed block, inspired by the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, consists of two convolutional components: one for capturing the trend (autoregression) and the other for refining local variations (moving average). Unlike conventional ARIMA, which requires iterative multi-step forecasting, the block directly performs multi-step forecasting, making it easily extendable to multivariate settings. Experiments on nine widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method ARMA achieves competitive accuracy, particularly on datasets exhibiting strong trend variations, while maintaining architectural simplicity. Furthermore, analysis shows that the block inherently encodes absolute positional information, suggesting its potential as a lightweight replacement for positional embeddings in sequential models.</p></details> |  |

We show that the $\mathtt{cstPP}$ class is robust and extensive and satisfies several closure properties. It is invariant depending on whether the set of primitive operations of the RAM is $\{+\}$, or $\{+,-,\times,\mathtt{div},\mathtt{mod}\}$, or any set of operations in $\mathtt{cstPP}$ provided it includes $+$. We prove that the $\mathtt{cstPP}$ class is closed under composition and, for fast-growing functions, is closed under inverse. We also show that in the definition of $\mathtt{cstPP}$ the constant-time procedure can be reduced to a single return instruction. Finally, we establish that linear preprocessing time is not essential in the definition of the $\mathtt{cstPP}$ class: this class is not modified if the preprocessing time is increased to $O(N^c)$, for any fixed $c>1$, or conversely, is reduced to $N^{\varepsilon}$, for any positive $\varepsilon<1$ (provided the set of primitive operation includes $+$, $\mathtt{div}$ and $\mathtt{mod}$). To complete the picture, we demonstrate that the $\mathtt{cstPP}$ class degenerates if the preprocessing time reduces to $N^{o(1)}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Ho...</summary><p>In Honor of Yuri Gurevich on the occasion of his 85th Birthday</p></details> |
| **[Multivariate Long-term Time Series Forecasting with Fourier Neural Filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09174v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate long-term time series forecasting has been suffering from the challenge of capturing both temporal dependencies within variables and spatial correlations across variables simultaneously. Current approaches predominantly repurpose backbones from natural language processing or computer vision (e.g., Transformers), which fail to adequately address the unique properties of time series (e.g., periodicity). The research community lacks a dedicated backbone with temporal-specific inductive biases, instead relying on domain-agnostic backbones supplemented with auxiliary techniques (e.g., signal decomposition). We introduce FNF as the backbone and DBD as the architecture to provide excellent learning capabilities and optimal learning pathways for spatio-temporal modeling, respectively. Our theoretical analysis proves that FNF unifies local time-domain and global frequency-domain information processing within a single backbone that extends naturally to spatial modeling, while information bottleneck theory demonstrates that DBD provides superior gradient flow and representation capacity compared to existing unified or sequential architectures. Our empirical evaluation across 11 public benchmark datasets spanning five domains (energy, meteorology, transportation, environment, and nature) confirms state-of-the-art performance with consistent hyperparameter settings. Notably, our approach achieves these results without any auxiliary techniques, suggesting that properly designed neural architectures can capture the inherent properties of time series, potentially transforming time series modeling in scientific and industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spectral Localization Method for Time-Fractional Integro-Differential Equations with Nonsmooth Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10091v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we develop a localized numerical scheme with low regularity requirements for solving time-fractional integro-differential equations. First, a fully discrete numerical scheme is constructed. Specifically, for temporal discretization, we employ the contour integral method (CIM) with parameterized hyperbolic contours to approximate the nonlocal operators. For spatial discretization, the standard piecewise linear Galerkin finite element method (FEM) is used. We then provide a rigorous error analysis, demonstrating that the proposed scheme achieves high accuracy even for problems with nonsmooth/vanishing initial values or low-regularity solutions, featuring spectral accuracy in time and second-order convergence in space. Finally, a series of numerical experiments in both 1-D and 2-D validate the theoretical findings and confirm that the algorithm combines the advantages of spectral accuracy, low computational cost, and efficient memory usage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive Spike Timing Enables Distributed Shortest Path Computation in Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10077v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient planning and sequence selection are central to intelligence, yet current approaches remain largely incompatible with biological computation. Classical graph algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* require global state and biologically implausible operations such as backtracing, while reinforcement learning methods rely on slow gradient-based policy updates that appear inconsistent with rapid behavioral adaptation observed in natural systems. We propose a biologically plausible algorithm for shortest-path computation that operates through local spike-based message-passing with realistic processing delays. The algorithm exploits spike-timing coincidences to identify nodes on optimal paths: Neurons that receive inhibitory-excitatory message pairs earlier than predicted reduce their response delays, creating a temporal compression that propagates backwards from target to source. Through analytical proof and simulations on random spatial networks, we demonstrate that the algorithm converges and discovers all shortest paths using purely timing-based mechanisms. By showing how short-term timing dynamics alone can compute shortest paths, this work provides new insights into how biological networks might solve complex computational problems through purely local computation and relative spike-time prediction. These findings open new directions for understanding distributed computation in biological and artificial systems, with possible implications for computational neuroscience, AI, reinforcement learning, and neuromorphic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Space-Time Tradeoffs for Spatial Conjunctive Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10050v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a conjunctive query and a database instance, we aim to develop an index that can efficiently answer spatial queries on the results of a conjunctive query. We are interested in some commonly used spatial queries, such as range emptiness, range count, and nearest neighbor queries. These queries have essential applications in data analytics, such as filtering relational data based on attribute ranges and temporal graph analysis for counting graph structures like stars, paths, and cliques. Furthermore, this line of research can accelerate relational algorithms that incorporate spatial queries in their workflow, such as relational clustering. Known approaches either have to spend $\tilde{O}(N)$ query time or use space as large as the number of query results, which are inefficient or unrealistic to employ in practice. Hence, we aim to construct an index that answers spatial conjunctive queries in both time- and space-efficient ways. In this paper, we establish lower bounds on the tradeoff between answering time and space usage. For $k$-star (resp. $k$-path) queries, we show that any index for range emptiness, range counting or nearest neighbor queries with $T$ answering time requires $\Omega\left(N+\frac{N^k}{T^k}\right)$ (resp. $\Omega\left(N+\frac{N^2}{T^{2/(k-1)}}\right)$) space. Then, we construct optimal indexes for answering range emptiness and range counting problems over $k$-star and $k$-path queries. Extending this result, we build an index for hierarchical queries. By resorting to the generalized hypertree decomposition, we can extend our index to arbitrary conjunctive queries for supporting spatial conjunctive queries. Finally, we show how our new indexes can be used to improve the running time of known algorithms in the relational setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Input-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13654v4)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling paradigm, Input-Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we utilize meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also discover a new phenomenon, train-test co-design. It requires us to apply query strategies during training and testing as a whole. Only applying strategies on training or testing would seriously degrade the performance gained. We are also surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can perform better. We can get the best performance even by adding irrelevant information to the queries, with randomly selected 1k examples from a minimally filtered dataset. These findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out". Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, the intuition of simply scaling the size should also be carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the Less is More phenomenon. 1K examples are enough to invoke high-level reasoning ability. With experiments on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, the result would be 90.0% on AIME24 and 80.0% on AIME25.

| **[TUNI: Real-time RGB-T Semantic Segmentation with Unified Multi-Modal Feature Extraction and Cross-Modal Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10005v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB-thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation improves the environmental perception of autonomous platforms in challenging conditions. Prevailing models employ encoders pre-trained on RGB images to extract features from both RGB and infrared inputs, and design additional modules to achieve cross-modal feature fusion. This results in limited thermal feature extraction and suboptimal cross-modal fusion, while the redundant encoders further compromises the model's real-time efficiency. To address the above issues, we propose TUNI, with an RGB-T encoder consisting of multiple stacked blocks that simultaneously perform multi-modal feature extraction and cross-modal fusion. By leveraging large-scale pre-training with RGB and pseudo-thermal data, the RGB-T encoder learns to integrate feature extraction and fusion in a unified manner. By slimming down the thermal branch, the encoder achieves a more compact architecture. Moreover, we introduce an RGB-T local module to strengthen the encoder's capacity for cross-modal local feature fusion. The RGB-T local module employs adaptive cosine similarity to selectively emphasize salient consistent and distinct local features across RGB-T modalities. Experimental results show that TUNI achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models on FMB, PST900 and CART, with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Meanwhile, it achieves an inference speed of 27 FPS on a Jetson Orin NX, demonstrating its real-time capability in deployment.

| **[Efficient Inference for Time-to-Event Outcomes by Integrating Right-Censored and Current Status Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10357v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a semiparametric data fusion framework for efficient inference on survival probabilities by integrating right-censored and current status data. Existing data fusion methods focus largely on fusing right-censored data only, while standard meta-analysis approaches are inadequate for combining right-censored and current status data, as estimators based on current status data alone typically converge at slower rates and have non-normal limiting distributions. In this work, we consider a semiparametric model under exchangeable event time distribution across data sources. We derive the canonical gradient of the survival probability at a given time, and develop one-step estimators along with the corresponding inference procedure. Specifically, we propose a doubly robust estimator and an efficient estimator that attains the semiparametric efficiency bound under mild conditions. Importantly, we show that incorporating current status data can lead to meaningful efficiency gains despite the slower convergence rate of current status-only estimators. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method in simulations and discuss extensions to settings with covariate shift. We believe that this work has the potential to open new directions in data fusion methodology, particularly for settings involving mixed censoring types.</p></details> |  |
| **[Faster and Better LLMs via Latency-Aware Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19634v4)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference. However, existing research has overlooked the efficiency of TTS from a latency-sensitive perspective. Through a latency-aware evaluation of representative TTS methods, we demonstrate that a compute-optimal TTS does not always result in the lowest latency in scenarios where latency is critical. To address this gap and achieve latency-optimal TTS, we propose two key approaches by optimizing the concurrency configurations: (1) branch-wise parallelism, which leverages multiple concurrent inference branches, and (2) sequence-wise parallelism, enabled by speculative decoding. By integrating these two approaches and allocating computational resources properly to each, our latency-optimal TTS enables a 32B model to reach 82.3% accuracy on MATH-500 within 1 minute and a smaller 3B model to achieve 72.4% within 10 seconds. Our work emphasizes the importance of latency-aware TTS and demonstrates its ability to deliver both speed and accuracy in latency-sensitive scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Exposure to high concentrations of PM$_{2.5}$ have been linked to increased respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions, more emergency department visits and deaths. Traditional air quality monitoring systems such as EPA-certified stations provide limited spatial and temporal data. The advent of low-cost sensors has dramatically improved the granularity of air quality data, enabling real-time, high-resolution monitoring. This study exploits the extensive data from PurpleAir sensors to assess and compare the effectiveness of various statistical and machine learning models in producing accurate hourly PM$_{2.5}$ maps across California. We evaluate traditional geostatistical methods, including kriging and land use regression, against advanced machine learning approaches such as neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines, as well as ensemble model. Our findings enhanced the predictive accuracy of PM2.5 concentration by correcting the bias in PurpleAir data with an ensemble model, which incorporating both spatiotemporal dependencies and machine learning models.</p></details> |  |

Dimension reduction methods can significantly simplify this process, provided that they account for the complex dependencies between variables and across time and space. Nonlinear blind source separation has emerged as a promising approach, particularly following recent advances in identifiability results. Building on these developments, we introduce the identifiable autoregressive variational autoencoder, which ensures the identifiability of latent components consisting of nonstationary autoregressive processes. The blind source separation efficacy of the proposed method is showcased through a simulation study, where it is compared against state-of-the-art methods, and the spatio-temporal prediction performance is evaluated against several competitors on air pollution and weather datasets.</p></details> |  |

Although some multimodal reasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific domains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall short in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of multimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare professionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through a directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in accommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the reasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the best recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at different time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and disease progression. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent temporal reasoning framework provides task distributions and a cross-validation mechanism to further enhance the accuracy of reasoning outputs. A few basic experiments and analysis results justify the novelty and practical utility of the proposed preliminary approach.</p></details> |  |

However, these models continue to suffer from hallucinations, producing content that conflicts with input videos. To address this issue, we propose Dr.V, a hierarchical framework covering perceptive, temporal, and cognitive levels to diagnose video hallucination by fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding. Dr.V comprises of two key components: a benchmark dataset Dr.V-Bench and a satellite video agent Dr.V-Agent. Dr.V-Bench includes 10k instances drawn from 4,974 videos spanning diverse tasks, each enriched with detailed spatial-temporal annotation. Dr.V-Agent detects hallucinations in LVMs by systematically applying fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding at the perceptive and temporal levels, followed by cognitive level reasoning. This step-by-step pipeline mirrors human-like video comprehension and effectively identifies hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dr.V-Agent is effective in diagnosing hallucination while enhancing interpretability and reliability, offering a practical blueprint for robust video understanding in real-world scenarios.

However, existing approaches struggle with scalability, probabilistic interpretability, and adaptability to evolving traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH, a lightweight and scalable framework for real-time anomaly detection in streaming edge data. Our method integrates temporal multi-tensor sketching with Count-Min Sketch using Conservative Update (CMS-CU) to compactly track edge frequency patterns with bounded memory, while mitigating hash collision issues. We incorporate Bayesian inference for probabilistic anomaly scoring and apply Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) for adaptive thresholding tuned to burst intensity. Extensive experiments on four real-world intrusion detection datasets demonstrate that ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as ANOEDGE-G/L, MIDAS-R, and F-FADE, achieving up to 6.5% AUC gain on CIC-IDS2018 and up to 15.6% on CIC-DDoS2019, while processing 20 million edges in under 3.4 seconds using only 10 hash functions. Our results show that ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH is practical and effective for fast, accurate anomaly detection in large-scale streaming graphs.

| **[Dynamic Adaptive Parsing of Temporal and Cross-Variable Patterns for Network State Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11601v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective network state classification is a primary task for ensuring network security and optimizing performance. Existing deep learning models have shown considerable progress in this area. Some methods excel at analyzing the complex temporal periodicities found in traffic data, while graph-based approaches are adept at modeling the dynamic dependencies between different variables. However, a key trade-off remains, as these methods struggle to capture both characteristics simultaneously. Models focused on temporal patterns often overlook crucial variable dependencies, whereas those centered on dependencies may fail to capture fine-grained temporal details. To address this trade-off, we introduce DAPNet, a framework based on a Mixture-of-Experts architecture. DAPNet integrates three specialized networks for periodic analysis, dynamic cross-variable correlation modeling, and hybrid temporal feature extraction. A learnable gating network dynamically assigns weights to experts based on the input sample and computes a weighted fusion of their outputs. Furthermore, a hybrid regularization loss function ensures stable training and addresses the common issue of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on two large-scale network intrusion detection datasets (CICIDS2017/2018) validate DAPNet's higher accuracy for its target application. The generalizability of the architectural design is evaluated across ten public UEA benchmark datasets, positioning DAPNet as a specialized framework for network state classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Traffic Incident Response through Sub-Second Temporal Localization with HybridMamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03235v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic crash detection in long-form surveillance videos is essential for improving emergency response and infrastructure planning, yet remains difficult due to the brief and infrequent nature of crash events. We present \textbf{HybridMamba}, a novel architecture integrating visual transformers with state-space temporal modeling to achieve high-precision crash time localization. Our approach introduces multi-level token compression and hierarchical temporal processing to maintain computational efficiency without sacrificing temporal resolution. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset from the Iowa Department of Transportation, HybridMamba achieves a mean absolute error of \textbf{1.50 seconds} for 2-minute videos ($p<0.01$ compared to baselines), with \textbf{65.2%} of predictions falling within one second of the ground truth. It outperforms recent video-language models (e.g., TimeChat, VideoLLaMA-2) by up to 3.95 seconds while using significantly fewer parameters (3B vs. 13--72B). Our results demonstrate effective temporal localization across various video durations (2--40 minutes) and diverse environmental conditions, highlighting HybridMamba's potential for fine-grained temporal localization in traffic surveillance while identifying challenges that remain for extended deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[STLCG++: A Masking Approach for Differentiable Signal Temporal Logic Specification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04194v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) offers a concise yet expressive framework for specifying and reasoning about spatio-temporal behaviors of robotic systems. Attractively, STL admits the notion of robustness, the degree to which an input signal satisfies or violates an STL specification, thus providing a nuanced evaluation of system performance. In particular, the differentiability of STL robustness enables direct integration to robotic workflows that rely on gradient-based optimization, such as trajectory optimization and deep learning. However, existing approaches to evaluating and differentiating STL robustness rely on recurrent computations, which become inefficient with longer sequences, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we present STLCG++, a masking-based approach that parallelizes STL robustness evaluation and backpropagation across timesteps, \revised{achieving more than 1000$\times$ faster computation time than the recurrent approach (STLCG++).}{achieving significant speed-ups compared to a recurrent approach.} We also introduce a smoothing technique to enable the differentiation of time interval bounds, thereby expanding STL's applicability in gradient-based optimization tasks involving spatial and temporal variables. Finally, we demonstrate STLCG++'s benefits through three robotics use cases and provide JAX and PyTorch libraries for seamless integration into modern robotics workflows.

| **[Improved Classification of Nitrogen Stress Severity in Plants Under Combined Stress Conditions Using Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06625v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses, both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment. Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral, and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data, document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low, medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies. We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop management and improved plant health.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 7 Tables</p></details> |
| **[A Copula-Guided Temporal Dependency Method for Multitemporal Hyperspectral Images Unmixing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11096v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing (MTHU) aims to model variable endmembers and dynamical abundances, which emphasizes the critical temporal information. However, existing methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependency, thus fail to capture the dynamical material evolution. Motivated by the ability of copula theory in modeling dependency structure explicitly, in this paper, we propose a copula-guided temporal dependency method (Cog-TD) for multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing. Cog-TD defines new mathematical model, constructs copula-guided framework and provides two key modules with theoretical support. The mathematical model provides explicit formulations for MTHU problem definition, which describes temporal dependency structure by incorporating copula theory. The copula-guided framework is constructed for utilizing copula function, which estimates dynamical endmembers and abundances with temporal dependency. The key modules consist of copula function estimation and temporal dependency guidance, which computes and employs temporal information to guide unmixing process. Moreover, the theoretical support demonstrates that estimated copula function is valid and the represented temporal dependency exists in hyperspectral images. The major contributions of this paper include redefining MTHU problem with temporal dependency, proposing a copula-guided framework, developing two key modules and providing theoretical support. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Occlusion-Aware Temporally Consistent Amodal Completion for 3D Human-Object Interaction Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08137v3)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.</p></details> | ACM MM 2025 |
| **[Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094v2)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training) and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information screening for improving video-language understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detectability Thresholds for Network Attacks on Static Graphs and Temporal Networks: Information-Theoretic Limits and Nearly-Optimal Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10925v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a consolidated theory for the detectability of network-borne attacks under two canonical observation models: (i) a static graph drawn from an Erdos-Renyi background with a planted anomalous community, and (ii) a temporal interaction network modeled by multivariate point processes (Poisson or Hawkes). Our main contribution is to match, up to universal constants, information-theoretic lower and upper bounds that govern when reliable testing is possible. In the static case, the core quantity is the accumulated edgewise signal k^2 * chi^2(Bern(p+Delta) || Bern(p)), where chi^2 ~ Delta^2 / [p(1-p)] for small Delta; detection is impossible when this falls below c * log n, and a non-backtracking spectral statistic succeeds above C * log n. In the temporal case, detectability is controlled by the KL information rate I contributed by internal edges over a window of length T, yielding a threshold T I >= log n; a likelihood-based cumulative-sum (CUSUM) test achieves first-order optimal delay approximately abs(log alpha) / I at false-alarm level alpha. We also quantify robustness to bounded edge perturbations and outline conditional statistical-computational separations. A brief case study shows how to turn these bounds into concrete design choices.</p></details> |  |

Analysing political speech data from more than 30 years requires the use of flexible topic models to uncover the latent topics and their change in prevalence over time as well as the change in the vocabulary of the topics. We propose the temporal Poisson factorisation (TPF) model as an extension to the Poisson factorisation model to model sparse count data matrices obtained based on the bag-of-words assumption from text documents with time stamps. We discuss and empirically compare different model specifications for the time-varying latent variables consisting either of a flexible auto-regressive structure of order one or a random walk. Estimation is based on variational inference where we consider a combination of coordinate ascent updates with automatic differentiation using batching of documents. Suitable variational families are proposed to ease inference. We compare results obtained using independent univariate variational distributions for the time-varying latent variables to those obtained with a multivariate variant. We discuss in detail the results of the TPF model when analysing speeches from 18 sessions in the U.S. Senate (1981-2016).</p></details> | <details><summary>main ...</summary><p>main paper: 20 pages (2 single figures, 3 double figures, 3 tables), appendix: 2 pages, supplementary materials: 18 pages (2 plots, 4 quadruple plots, 2 tables), references: 3 pages</p></details> |
| **[Directed Temporal Tree Realization for Periodic Public Transport: Easy and Hard Cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07920v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the complexity of the directed periodic temporal graph realization problem. This work is motivated by the design of periodic schedules in public transport with constraints on the quality of service. Namely, we require that the fastest path between (important) pairs of vertices is upper bounded by a specified maximum duration, encoded in an upper distance matrix $D$. While previous work has considered the undirected version of the problem, the application in public transport schedule design requires the flexibility to assign different departure times to the two directions of an edge. A problem instance can only be feasible if all values of the distance matrix are at least shortest path distances. However, the task of realizing exact fastest path distances in a periodic temporal graph is often too restrictive. Therefore, we introduce a minimum slack parameter $k$ that describes a lower bound on the maximum allowed waiting time on each path. We concentrate on tree topologies and provide a full characterization of the complexity landscape with respect to the period $\Delta$ and the minimum slack parameter $k$, showing a sharp threshold between NP-complete cases and cases which are always realizable. We also provide hardness results for the special case of period $\Delta = 2$ for general directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[GundamQ: Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Representation Learning for Robust Robot Path Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10305v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In dynamic and uncertain environments, robotic path planning demands accurate spatiotemporal environment understanding combined with robust decision-making under partial observability. However, current deep reinforcement learning-based path planning methods face two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of multi-scale temporal dependencies, resulting in suboptimal adaptability in dynamic scenarios, and (2) inefficient exploration-exploitation balance, leading to degraded path quality. To address these challenges, we propose GundamQ: A Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Q-Network for Robotic Path Planning. The framework comprises two key modules: (i) the Spatiotemporal Perception module, which hierarchically extracts multi-granularity spatial features and multi-scale temporal dependencies ranging from instantaneous to extended time horizons, thereby improving perception accuracy in dynamic environments; and (ii) the Adaptive Policy Optimization module, which balances exploration and exploitation during training while optimizing for smoothness and collision probability through constrained policy updates. Experiments in dynamic environments demonstrate that GundamQ achieves a 15.3\% improvement in success rate and a 21.7\% increase in overall path quality, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[On Syntactical Simplification of Temporal Operators in Negation-free MTL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10146v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal reasoning in dynamic, data-intensive environments increasingly demands expressive yet tractable logical frameworks. Traditional approaches often rely on negation to express absence or contradiction. In such contexts, Negation-as-Failure is commonly used to infer negative information from the lack of positive evidence. However, open and distributed systems such as IoT networks or the Semantic Web Negation-as-Failure semantics become unreliable due to incomplete and asynchronous data. This has led to a growing interest in negation-free fragments of temporal rule-based systems, which preserve monotonicity and enable scalable reasoning. This paper investigates the expressive power of negation-free MTL, a temporal logic framework designed for rule-based reasoning over time. We show that the "always" operators of MTL, often treated as syntactic sugar for combinations of other temporal constructs, can be eliminated using "once", "since" and "until" operators. Remarkably, even the "once" operators can be removed, yielding a fragment based solely on "until" and "since". These results challenge the assumption that negation is necessary for expressing universal temporal constraints, and reveal a robust fragment capable of capturing both existential and invariant temporal patterns. Furthermore, the results induce a reduction in the syntax of MTL, which in turn can provide benefits for both theoretical study as well as implementation efforts.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling (PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to +3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22% bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 4th IEEE International Workshop on Sport Technology and Research</p></details> |

The primary aim of the paper is to construct the spatiotemporal tube (STT) using a sampling-based approach and thereby devise a closed-form approximation-free control strategy to ensure that system trajectory reaches the target set while avoiding time-dependent unsafe sets. The proposed scheme utilizes a novel method involving STTs to provide controllers that guarantee both system safety and reachability. In our sampling-based framework, we translate the requirements of STTs into a Robust optimization program (ROP). To address the infeasibility of ROP caused by infinite constraints, we utilize the sampling-based Scenario optimization program (SOP). Subsequently, we solve the SOP to generate the tube and closed-form controller for an unknown system, ensuring the temporal reach-avoid-stay specification. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through three case studies: an omnidirectional robot, a SCARA manipulator, and a magnetic levitation system.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Graphical Counterfactuals: An Overview](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01875v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counterfactual thinking is a critical yet challenging topic for artificial intelligence to learn knowledge from data and ultimately improve their performances for new scenarios. Many research works, including Potential Outcome Model and Structural Causal Model, have been proposed to realize it. However, their modelings, theoretical foundations and application approaches are usually different. Moreover, there is a lack of graphical approach to infer spatio-temporal counterfactuals, that considers spatial and temporal interactions between multiple units. Thus, in this work, our aim is to investigate a survey to compare and discuss different counterfactual models, theories and approaches, and further build a unified graphical causal frameworks to infer the spatio-temporal counterfactuals.</p></details> | in press |
| **[Mechanistic Learning with Guided Diffusion Models to Predict Spatio-Temporal Brain Tumor Growth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09610v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time predictions that account for mechanistic priors.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[An Ontology-Driven Graph RAG for Legal Norms: A Structural, Temporal, and Deterministic Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00039v5)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the legal domain face a critical challenge: standard, flat-text retrieval is blind to the hierarchical, diachronic, and causal structure of law, leading to anachronistic and unreliable answers. This paper introduces the Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG), an ontology-driven framework designed to overcome these limitations by explicitly modeling the formal structure and diachronic nature of legal norms. We ground our knowledge graph in a formal, LRMoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal Works from their versioned Expressions. We model temporal states as efficient aggregations that reuse the versioned expressions (CTVs) of unchanged components, and we reify legislative events as first-class Action nodes to make causality explicit and queryable. This structured backbone enables a unified, planner-guided query strategy that applies explicit policies to deterministically resolve complex requests for (i) point-in-time retrieval, (ii) hierarchical impact analysis, and (iii) auditable provenance reconstruction. Through a case study on the Brazilian Constitution, we demonstrate how this approach provides a verifiable, temporally-correct substrate for LLMs, enabling higher-order analytical capabilities while drastically reducing the risk of factual errors. The result is a practical framework for building more trustworthy and explainable legal AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major revision for clarity and academic precision.

We introduce three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive latent representations, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windowed temporal fusion using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance for downstream SLAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Zero-Inflated Spatio-Temporal Model for Integrating Fishery-Dependent and Independent Data under Preferential Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09336v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sustainable management of marine ecosystems is vital for maintaining healthy fishery resources, and benefits from advanced scientific tools to accurately assess species distribution patterns. In fisheries science, two primary data sources are used: fishery-independent data (FID), collected through systematic surveys, and fishery-dependent data (FDD), obtained from commercial fishing activities. While these sources provide complementary information, their distinct sampling schemes - systematic for FID and preferential for FDD - pose significant integration challenges. This study introduces a novel spatio-temporal model that integrates FID and FDD, addressing challenges associated with zero-inflation and preferential sampling (PS) common in ecological data. The model employs a six-layer structure to differentiate between presence-absence and biomass observations, offering a robust framework for ecological studies affected by PS biases. Simulation results demonstrate the model's accuracy in parameter estimation across diverse PS scenarios and its ability to detect preferential signals. Application to the study of the distribution patterns of the European sardine populations along the southern Portuguese continental shelf illustrates the model's effectiveness in integrating diverse data sources and incorporating environmental and vessel-specific covariates. The model reveals spatio-temporal variability in sardine presence and biomass, providing actionable insights for fisheries management. Beyond ecology, this framework offers broad applicability to data integration challenges in other disciplines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Query Network for Efficient Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12917v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sufficiently modeling the correlations among variables (aka channels) is crucial for achieving accurate multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). In this paper, we propose a novel technique called Temporal Query (TQ) to more effectively capture multivariate correlations, thereby improving model performance in MTSF tasks. Technically, the TQ technique employs periodically shifted learnable vectors as queries in the attention mechanism to capture global inter-variable patterns, while the keys and values are derived from the raw input data to encode local, sample-level correlations. Building upon the TQ technique, we develop a simple yet efficient model named Temporal Query Network (TQNet), which employs only a single-layer attention mechanism and a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that TQNet learns more robust multivariate correlations, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across 12 challenging real-world datasets. Furthermore, TQNet achieves high efficiency comparable to linear-based methods even on high-dimensional datasets, balancing performance and computational cost. The code is available at: https://github.com/ACAT-SCUT/TQNet.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients and the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls), employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy. Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner 2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation. ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 7 figures. Preprint.

| **[Trace Repair for Temporal Behavior Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08610v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present methods for repairing traces against specifications given as temporal behavior trees (TBT). TBT are a specification formalism for action sequences in robotics and cyber-physical systems, where specifications of sub-behaviors, given in signal temporal logic, are composed using operators for sequential and parallel composition, fallbacks, and repetition. Trace repairs are useful to explain failures and as training examples that avoid the observed problems. In principle, repairs can be obtained via mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), but this is far too expensive for practical applications. We present two practical repair strategies: (1) incremental repair, which reduces the MILP by splitting the trace into segments, and (2) landmark-based repair, which solves the repair problem iteratively using TBT's robust semantics as a heuristic that approximates MILP with more efficient linear programming. In our experiments, we were able to repair traces with more than 25,000 entries in under ten minutes, while MILP runs out of memory.</p></details> |  |

This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images. PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth based on multiple past observations. To make use of this PrediTree dataset, we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same experiments but on fewer bands (red, green, blue only), by around $30\%$.

| **[Self-Supervised Temporal Super-Resolution of Energy Data using Generative Adversarial Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10587v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue, this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application scenario is improved by 13%.</p></details> |  |

Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e., in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii) the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments are conducted.</p></details> |  |

Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps. Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low latency (within 5 time-steps).</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

While most existing studies assume static datasets, in real-world scenarios clients may continuously collect data with time-varying and non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. A critical challenge is how to adapt models in a timely yet efficient manner to such evolving data. In this paper, we propose FedTeddi, a temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware scheduling algorithm that facilitates fast convergence of FEEL under dynamic data evolution and communication resource limits. We first quantify the temporal dynamics and non-i.i.d. characteristics of data using temporal drift and collective divergence, respectively, and represent them as the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) of class distributions for classification tasks. We then propose a novel optimization objective and develop a joint scheduling and bandwidth allocation algorithm, enabling the FEEL system to learn from new data quickly without forgetting previous knowledge. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence compared to benchmark methods, improving the rate of convergence by 58.4% on CIFAR-10 and 49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Given a dynamical system and a specification, the objective is to synthesize the controller such that the closed-loop system satisfies this specification while maximizing its resilience. The problem is formulated as a robust optimization program where the objective is to compute the maximum resilience while simultaneously synthesizing the corresponding controller parameters. For linear systems and linear controllers, exact solutions are provided for the class of time-varying polytopic specifications. For the case of nonlinear systems, nonlinear controllers and more general specifications, we leverage tools from the scenario optimization approach, offering a probabilistic guarantee of the solution as well as computational feasibility. Different case studies are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[LASER: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Learning Spatial-Temporal Scene Graphs with Weak Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07647v6)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised approaches for learning spatio-temporal scene graphs (STSG) from video are greatly hindered due to their reliance on STSG-annotated videos, which are labor-intensive to construct at scale. Is it feasible to instead use readily available video captions as weak supervision? To address this question, we propose LASER, a neuro-symbolic framework to enable training STSG generators using only video captions. LASER employs large language models to first extract logical specifications with rich spatio-temporal semantic information from video captions. LASER then trains the underlying STSG generator to align the predicted STSG with the specification. The alignment algorithm overcomes the challenges of weak supervision by leveraging a differentiable symbolic reasoner and using a combination of contrastive, temporal, and semantics losses. The overall approach efficiently trains low-level perception models to extract a fine-grained STSG that conforms to the video caption. In doing so, it enables a novel methodology for learning STSGs without tedious annotations. We evaluate our method on three video datasets: OpenPVSG, 20BN, and MUGEN. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over fully-supervised baselines, achieving a unary predicate prediction accuracy of 27.78% (+12.65%) and a binary recall@5 of 0.42 (+0.22) on OpenPVSG. Additionally, LASER exceeds baselines by 7% on 20BN and 5.2% on MUGEN in terms of overall predicate prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025</p></details> |

While spatio-temporal graph (STG) models are a leading paradigm for such data, they often fall short in dynamic, human-centric environments due to two fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on static graph topologies, which fail to capture physical, event-driven dynamics, and (2) their tendency to confuse spurious correlations with true causality, undermining robustness in human-centric environments. To address these gaps, we propose the Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (DyC-STG), a novel framework designed for real-time data credibility analysis in IoT. Our framework features two synergistic contributions: an event-driven dynamic graph module that adapts the graph topology in real-time to reflect physical state changes, and a causal reasoning module to distill causally-aware representations by strictly enforcing temporal precedence. To facilitate the research in this domain we release two new real-world datasets. Comprehensive experiments show that DyC-STG establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving an F1-Score of up to 0.930.</p></details> |  |

Functional testing detects SDE-related faults but is expensive to simulate. We present a unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) for fast, accurate prediction of long-cycle fault impact probabilities (FIPs) in large sequential circuits, supporting quantitative risk assessment. Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to capture topology and signal timing; dedicated spatial and temporal encoders predict multi-cycle FIPs efficiently. On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). The framework accepts features from testability metrics or fault simulation, allowing efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. A test-point selection study shows that choosing observation points by predicted FIPs improves detection of long-cycle, hard-to-detect faults. The approach scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization and fits downstream electronic design automation flows.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, plan to submit to ACM TODAES</p></details> |

Here we developed a multi-dimensional framework to examine gender differences in scientific knowledge creation through three complementary temporal dimensions: stability (consistency of performance over time), volatility (degree of year-to-year fluctuation), and persistence (ability to maintain high performance for extended periods). Using comprehensive bibliometric data from SciSciNet covering 62.5 million authors whose careers began between 1960-2010, we constructed knowledge creation capability measures that captured how scientists absorb knowledge from diverse sources and contribute to field advancement. We found that female scientists demonstrated significantly higher knowledge production stability (0.170 vs. 0.119 for males) while simultaneously exhibiting greater year-to-year volatility (6.606 vs. 6.228), revealing a striking paradox in career dynamics. Female scientists showed persistence advantages under moderate performance requirements but faced disadvantages under extreme criteria demanding sustained peak performance. However, these patterns varied substantially across disciplines, with female advantages strongest in humanities and social sciences while STEM fields show mixed results.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment, fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both pose accuracy and robustness.

We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information. The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of 2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.</p></details> |  |

Traditional input modalities, such as Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements. Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network (MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI, comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures (VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety of applications.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel end-to-end deep learning framework of Discriminative Residual Dense Convolutional Autoencoder with Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (DRDCAE-STGNN) to enhance the MI feature learning and classification. Specifically, the DRDCAE module leverages residual-dense connections to learn discriminative latent representations through joint reconstruction and classifica-tion, while the STGNN module captures dynamic spatial dependencies via a learnable graph adjacency matrix and models temporal dynamics using bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM). Extensive evaluations on BCI Competition IV 2a, 2b, and PhysioNet datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 95.42%, 97.51%, and 90.15%, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component, and interpreta-bility analysis reveals neurophysiologically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, despite its complexity, the model maintains a feasible parameter count and an inference time of 0.32 ms per sample. These results indicate that our method offers a robust, accurate, and interpretable solution for MI-EEG decoding, with strong generalizability across subjects and tasks and meeting the requirements for potential real-time BCI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to IEEE Journal</p></details> |

Although powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis, previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on change captioning and visual question answering tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Temporal Fusion Transformers for Cryptocurrency Price Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10542v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise short-term price prediction in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market is critical for informed trading strategies. Although Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) have shown potential, their direct use often struggles in the face of the market's non-stationary nature and extreme volatility. This paper introduces an adaptive TFT modeling approach leveraging dynamic subseries lengths and pattern-based categorization to enhance short-term forecasting. We propose a novel segmentation method where subseries end at relative maxima, identified when the price increase from the preceding minimum surpasses a threshold, thus capturing significant upward movements, which act as key markers for the end of a growth phase, while potentially filtering the noise. Crucially, the fixed-length pattern ending each subseries determines the category assigned to the subsequent variable-length subseries, grouping typical market responses that follow similar preceding conditions. A distinct TFT model trained for each category is specialized in predicting the evolution of these subsequent subseries based on their initial steps after the preceding peak. Experimental results on ETH-USDT 10-minute data over a two-month test period demonstrate that our adaptive approach significantly outperforms baseline fixed-length TFT and LSTM models in prediction accuracy and simulated trading profitability. Our combination of adaptive segmentation and pattern-conditioned forecasting enables more robust and responsive cryptocurrency price prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion-enhanced Cardiac Anatomy Segmentation via an Insertable Temporal Attention Module](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14929v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiac anatomy segmentation is useful for clinical assessment of cardiac morphology to inform diagnosis and intervention. Deep learning (DL), especially with motion information, has improved segmentation accuracy. However, existing techniques for motion enhancement are not yet optimal, and they have high computational costs due to increased dimensionality or reduced robustness due to suboptimal approaches that use non-DL motion registration, non-attention models, or single-headed attention. They further have limited adaptability and are inconvenient for incorporation into existing networks where motion awareness is desired. Here, we propose a novel, computationally efficient Temporal Attention Module (TAM) that offers robust motion enhancement, modeled as a small, multi-headed, cross-temporal attention module. TAM's uniqueness is that it is a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be inserted into a broad range of segmentation networks (CNN-based, Transformer-based, or hybrid) for motion enhancement without requiring substantial changes in the network's backbone. This feature enables high adaptability and ease of integration for enhancing both existing and future networks. Extensive experiments on multiple 2D and 3D cardiac ultrasound and MRI datasets confirm that TAM consistently improves segmentation across a range of networks while maintaining computational efficiency and improving on currently reported performance. The evidence demonstrates that it is a robust, generalizable solution for motion-awareness enhancement that is scalable (such as from 2D to 3D).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation in the 6th International Workshop of Advances in Simplifying Medical Ultrasound (ASMUS).

| **[Select, then Balance: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Exogenous-Aware Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05779v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting aims to predict the future state of dynamic systems and plays an important role in multiple fields. However, existing solutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target variables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into the model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to promote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two challenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the target system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and future variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \model, a novel framework for modeling \underline{exo}genous variables in \underline{s}patio-\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select, then balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated expert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent space to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized sub-experts. Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which recomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs are integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic balance during the modeling process. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency of our proposed framework.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

We apply these results to analyze the performance of the Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithm with linear function approximations, a widely used method for policy evaluation in Reinforcement Learning (RL), obtaining a sharp high-probability consistency guarantee that matches the asymptotic variance up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, we establish an $O(T^{-\frac{1}{4}}\log T)$ distributional convergence rate for the Gaussian approximation of the TD estimator, measured in convex distance. Our martingale bounds are of broad applicability, and our analysis of TD learning provides new insights into statistical inference for RL algorithms, bridging gaps between classical stochastic approximation theory and modern RL applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaSTH-Sleep: Towards Effective Few-Shot Sleep Stage Classification for Health Management with Spatial-Temporal Hypergraph Enhanced Meta-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17142v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of sleep stages based on bio-signals is fundamental not only for automatic sleep stage annotation, but also for clinical health management and continuous sleep monitoring. Traditionally, this task relies on experienced clinicians to manually annotate data, a process that is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, deep learning methods have shown promise in automating this task. However, three major challenges remain: (1) deep learning models typically require large-scale labeled datasets, making them less effective in real-world settings where annotated data is limited; (2) significant inter-individual variability in bio-signals often results in inconsistent model performance when applied to new subjects, limiting generalization; and (3) existing approaches often overlook the high-order relationships among bio-signals, failing to simultaneously capture signal heterogeneity and spatial-temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose MetaSTH-Sleep, a few-shot sleep stage classification framework based on spatial-temporal hypergraph enhanced meta-learning. Our approach enables rapid adaptation to new subjects using only a few labeled samples, while the hypergraph structure effectively models complex spatial interconnections and temporal dynamics simultaneously in EEG signals. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaSTH-Sleep achieves substantial performance improvements across diverse subjects, offering valuable insights to support clinicians in sleep stage annotation.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPA: Temporal Prompt Alignment for Fetal Congenital Heart Defect Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15298v5)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA), a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to 58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Connectionist Temporal Classification for Phoneme Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05399v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Phoneme Recognition (APR) systems are often trained using pseudo phoneme-level annotations generated from text through Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) systems. These G2P systems frequently output multiple possible pronunciations per word, but the standard Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss cannot account for such ambiguity during training. In this work, we adapt Graph Temporal Classification (GTC) to the APR setting. GTC enables training from a graph of alternative phoneme sequences, allowing the model to consider multiple pronunciations per word as valid supervision. Our experiments on English and Dutch data sets show that incorporating multiple pronunciations per word into the training loss consistently improves phoneme error rates compared to a baseline trained with CTC. These results suggest that integrating pronunciation variation into the loss function is a promising strategy for training APR systems from noisy G2P-based supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Workshop (ASRU 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight DNN for Full-Band Speech Denoising on Mobile Devices: Exploiting Long and Short Temporal Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05079v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech denoising (SD) is an important task of many, if not all, modern signal processing chains used in devices and for everyday-life applications. While there are many published and powerful deep neural network (DNN)-based methods for SD, few are optimized for resource-constrained platforms such as mobile devices. Additionally, most DNN-based methods for SD are not focusing on full-band (FB) signals, i.e. having 48 kHz sampling rate, and/or low latency cases. In this paper we present a causal, low latency, and lightweight DNN-based method for full-band SD, leveraging both short and long temporal patterns. The method is based on a modified UNet architecture employing look-back frames, temporal spanning of convolutional kernels, and recurrent neural networks for exploiting short and long temporal patterns in the signal and estimated denoising mask. The DNN operates on a causal frame-by-frame basis taking as an input the STFT magnitude, utilizes inverted bottlenecks inspired by MobileNet, employs causal instance normalization for channel-wise normalization, and achieves a real-time factor below 0.02 when deployed on a modern mobile phone. The proposed method is evaluated using established speech denoising metrics and publicly available datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving an (SI-)SDR value that outperforms existing FB and low latency SD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Proceedings of the 2025 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP)</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Spectrum Analysis for Multi-Constellation Space Domain Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05149v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Space Domain Awareness (SDA) system has different major aspects including continues and robust awareness from the network that is crucial for an efficient control over all actors in space. The observability of the space assets on the other hand requires efficient analysis on when and how observed space objects can be controlled. This becomes crucial when real-world spatial dynamics are taken into account as it introduces complexities into the system. The real-world dynamics can reveal the structure of the network including isolated and dominant stations. We propose a Temporal Spectrum Analysis (TSA) scheme that takes into account a set of real-world parameters including actual dynamics of the objects in space to analyze the structure of a ground-space network that inherits temporal spectrum as the key element of design. We study the potential interactions between multiple constellations using TSA and conduct a comprehensive real-world simulations to quantify the structure of the network. Numerical results show how the temporal spectrum of each satellite affects the intra- and inter-constellation network structure including interactions between ground stations and constellations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Large Language Models with Temporal Reasoning for Longitudinal Clinical Summarization and Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18724v3)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in clinical text summarization, but their ability to handle long patient trajectories with multi-modal data spread across time remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates several state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, their Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) variants and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on long-context clinical summarization and prediction. We examine their ability to synthesize structured and unstructured Electronic Health Records (EHR) data while reasoning over temporal coherence, by re-engineering existing tasks, including discharge summarization and diagnosis prediction from two publicly available EHR datasets. Our results indicate that long context windows improve input integration but do not consistently enhance clinical reasoning, and LLMs are still struggling with temporal progression and rare disease prediction. While RAG shows improvements in hallucination in some cases, it does not fully address these limitations. Our work fills the gap in long clinical text summarization, establishing a foundation for evaluating LLMs with multi-modal data and temporal reasoning.</p></details> |  |

To address key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro) contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling spatial dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures, under review for journal publication</p></details> |

We show that those temporal languages which do not pp-construct EVERYTHING (and thus by the classification are solvable in polynomial time) have, in fact, very limited expressive power as measured by the graphs and hypergraphs they can pp-interpret. This limitation yields many previously unknown algebraic consequences, while also providing new, uniform proofs for known invariance properties. In particular, we show that such temporal constraint languages admit $4$-ary pseudo-Siggers polymorphisms -- a result that sustains the possibility that the existence of such polymorphisms extends to the much broader context of the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Temporal Interest-Driven Multimodal Personalized Content Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04330v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the dynamic evolution of user interests and the increasing multimodal demands in internet applications, personalized content generation strategies based on static interest preferences struggle to meet practical application requirements. The proposed TIMGen (Temporal Interest-driven Multimodal Generation) model addresses this challenge by modeling the long-term temporal evolution of users' interests and capturing dynamic interest representations with strong temporal dependencies. This model also supports the fusion of multimodal features, such as text, images, video, and audio, and delivers customized content based on multimodal preferences. TIMGen jointly learns temporal dependencies and modal preferences to obtain a unified interest representation, which it then generates to meet users' personalized content needs. TIMGen overcomes the shortcomings of personalized content recommendation methods based on static preferences, enabling flexible and dynamic modeling of users' multimodal interests, better understanding and capturing their interests and preferences. It can be extended to a variety of practical application scenarios, including e-commerce, advertising, online education, and precision medicine, providing insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we model the observations by two weakly time-stationary point processes with spatial intensity measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ over the expanding window $(0,t]$ as $t$ increases to infinity, and establish sharp convergence rates of the empirical UOT in terms of the intrinsic dimensions of the measures. We assume a sub-quadratic temporal growth condition of the variance of the process, which allows for a wide range of temporal dependencies. As the growth approaches quadratic, the convergence rate becomes slower. This variance assumption is related to the time-reduced factorial covariance measure, and we exemplify its validity for various point processes, including the Poisson cluster, Hawkes, Neyman-Scott, and log-Gaussian Cox processes. Complementary to our upper bounds, we also derive matching lower bounds for various spatio-temporal point processes of interest and establish near minimax rate optimality of the empirical Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally, 76 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

Existing methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and (ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.</p></details> |  |

We propose RTQA, a novel framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

The vast majority of TD methods for control learn a policy by bootstrapping from a single action-value function (e.g., Q-learning and Sarsa). Significantly less attention has been given to methods that bootstrap from two asymmetric value functions: i.e., methods that learn state values as an intermediate step in learning action values. Existing algorithms in this vein can be categorized as either QV-learning or AV-learning. Though these algorithms have been investigated to some degree in prior work, it remains unclear if and when it is advantageous to learn two value functions instead of just one -- and whether such approaches are theoretically sound in general. In this paper, we analyze these algorithmic families in terms of convergence and sample efficiency. We find that while both families are more efficient than Expected Sarsa in the prediction setting, only AV-learning methods offer any major benefit over Q-learning in the control setting. Finally, we introduce a new AV-learning algorithm called Regularized Dueling Q-learning (RDQ), which significantly outperforms Dueling DQN in the MinAtar benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in RLC/RLJ 2025.

Different from visual generation, the occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models. Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency}, \textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a \textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Per-Garment Virtual Try-On with Temporal Consistency for Loose-Fitting Garments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12348v3)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Per-garment virtual try-on methods collect garment-specific datasets and train networks tailored to each garment to achieve superior results. However, these approaches often struggle with loose-fitting garments due to two key limitations: (1) They rely on human body semantic maps to align garments with the body, but these maps become unreliable when body contours are obscured by loose-fitting garments, resulting in degraded outcomes; (2) They train garment synthesis networks on a per-frame basis without utilizing temporal information, leading to noticeable jittering artifacts. To address the first limitation, we propose a two-stage approach for robust semantic map estimation. First, we extract a garment-invariant representation from the raw input image. This representation is then passed through an auxiliary network to estimate the semantic map. This enhances the robustness of semantic map estimation under loose-fitting garments during garment-specific dataset generation. To address the second limitation, we introduce a recurrent garment synthesis framework that incorporates temporal dependencies to improve frame-to-frame coherence while maintaining real-time performance. We conducted qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both image quality and temporal coherence. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the garment-invariant representation and the recurrent synthesis framework.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we explore an unreported source of bias-arising from temporally correlated exposure status-that is typically unmeasured and overlooked in standard analyses. Although this form of bias can plausibly affect a wide range of VE trials, it has received limited empirical attention. We develop a mathematical framework to characterize the mechanism of this bias and derive a closed-form approximation to quantify its magnitude without requiring direct measurement of exposure. Our findings show that, under realistic parameter settings, the resulting bias can be substantial. These results suggest that temporally correlated exposure should be recognized as a potentially important factor in the design and analysis of infectious disease vaccine trials.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

However, as of yet, the analysis of social networks using the time series of people's mobile connectivity data has not been extensively investigated. In the present study, we investigate four snapshot - based temporal GNNs in predicting the phone call and SMS activity between users of a mobile communication network. In addition, we develop a simple non - GNN baseline model using recently proposed EdgeBank method. Our analysis shows that the ROLAND temporal GNN outperforms the baseline model in most cases, whereas the other three GNNs perform on average worse than the baseline. The results show that GNN based approaches hold promise in the analysis of temporal social networks through mobile connectivity data. However, due to the relatively small performance margin between ROLAND and the baseline model, further research is required on specialized GNN architectures for temporal social network analysis.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |

Existing approaches are predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks. Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits, with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally-Aware Diffusion Model for Brain Progression Modelling with Bidirectional Temporal Regularisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03141v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However, current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures, thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline (backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications, this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The code will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Despite the numerous algorithms proposed with different DL architectures, maintaining a balance among performance, computational complexity, and multi-source ECG feature fusion remains challenging. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across various fields. Their inherent design for high-efficiency computation and linear complexity makes them particularly suitable for low-dimensional data like ECGs. This work proposes S2M2ECG, an SSM architecture featuring three-level fusion mechanisms: (1) Spatio-temporal bi-directional SSMs with segment tokenization for low-level signal fusion, (2) Intra-lead temporal information fusion with bi-directional scanning to enhance recognition accuracy in both forward and backward directions, (3) Cross-lead feature interaction modules for spatial information fusion. To fully leverage the ECG-specific multi-lead mechanisms inherent in ECG signals, a multi-branch design and lead fusion modules are incorporated, enabling individual analysis of each lead while ensuring seamless integration with others. Experimental results reveal that S2M2ECG achieves superior performance in the rhythmic, morphological, and clinical scenarios. Moreover, its lightweight architecture ensures it has nearly the fewest parameters among existing models, making it highly suitable for efficient inference and convenient deployment. Collectively, S2M2ECG offers a promising alternative that strikes an excellent balance among performance, computational complexity, and ECG-specific characteristics, paving the way for high-performance, lightweight computations in CVD diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

Existing works on STL control synthesis mainly focus on generating plans that satisfy properties over a single executed trajectory. In this work, we consider the planning problem for hyperproperties evaluated over a set of possible trajectories, which naturally arise in information-flow control problems. Specifically, we study discrete-time dynamical systems and employ the recently developed temporal logic HyperSTL as the new objective for planning. To solve this problem, we propose a novel recursive counterexample-guided synthesis approach capable of effectively handling HyperSTL specifications with multiple alternating quantifiers. The proposed method is not only applicable to planning but also extends to HyperSTL model checking for discrete-time dynamical systems. Finally, we present case studies on security-preserving planning and ambiguity-free planning to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HyperSTL planning framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lattice Annotated Temporal (LAT) Logic for Non-Markovian Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02958v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Lattice Annotated Temporal (LAT) Logic, an extension of Generalized Annotated Logic Programs (GAPs) that incorporates temporal reasoning and supports open-world semantics through the use of a lower lattice structure. This logic combines an efficient deduction process with temporal logic programming to support non-Markovian relationships and open-world reasoning capabilities. The open-world aspect, a by-product of the use of the lower-lattice annotation structure, allows for efficient grounding through a Skolemization process, even in domains with infinite or highly diverse constants. We provide a suite of theoretical results that bound the computational complexity of the grounding process, in addition to showing that many of the results on GAPs (using an upper lattice) still hold with the lower lattice and temporal extensions (though different proof techniques are required). Our open-source implementation, PyReason, features modular design, machine-level optimizations, and direct integration with reinforcement learning environments. Empirical evaluations across multi-agent simulations and knowledge graph tasks demonstrate up to three orders of magnitude speedup and up to five orders of magnitude memory reduction while maintaining or improving task performance. Additionally, we evaluate LAT Logic's value in reinforcement learning environments as a non-Markovian simulator, achieving up to three orders of magnitude faster simulation with improved agent performance, including a 26% increase in win rate due to capturing richer temporal dependencies. These results highlight LAT Logic's potential as a unified, extensible framework for open-world temporal reasoning in dynamic and uncertain environments. Our implementation is available at: pyreason.syracuse.edu.</p></details> |  |

Existing modeling methods are limited by local receptive fields, making it difficult to capture long-range temporal patterns and cross-band dynamic coupling effects in machine acoustic features. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, ESTM, which is based on a dual-path Mamba architecture with time-frequency decoupled modeling and utilizes Selective State-Space Models (SSM) for long-range sequence modeling. ESTM extracts rich feature representations from different time segments and frequency bands by fusing enhanced Mel spectrograms and raw audio features, while further improving sensitivity to anomalous patterns through the TriStat-Gating (TSG) module. Our experiments demonstrate that ESTM improves anomalous detection performance on the DCASE 2020 Task 2 dataset, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Signal Processing Letters 2025</p></details> |

However, space applications require reliable and precise computations, while memristive devices suffer from non-idealities, such as device variability, conductance drifts, and device faults. Thus, porting neural networks (NNs) to memristive devices often faces the challenge of severe performance degradation. In this work, we show in simulations that memristor-based NNs achieve competitive performance levels on on-board tasks, such as navigation \& control and geodesy of asteroids. Through bit-slicing, temporal averaging of NN layers, and periodic activation functions, we improve initial results from around $0.07$ to $0.01$ and $0.3$ to $0.007$ for both tasks using RRAM devices, coming close to state-of-the-art levels ($0.003-0.005$ and $0.003$, respectively). Our results demonstrate the potential of memristors for on-board space applications, and we are convinced that future technology and NN improvements will further close the performance gap to fully unlock the benefits of memristors.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, IAA acta astronautica. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2509.02369</p></details> |
| **[Bullet: Boosting GPU Utilization for LLM Serving via Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Orchestration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19516v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern LLM serving systems confront inefficient GPU utilization due to the fundamental mismatch between compute-intensive prefill and memory-bound decode phases. While current practices attempt to address this by organizing these phases into hybrid batches, such solutions create an inefficient tradeoff that sacrifices either throughput or latency, leaving substantial GPU resources underutilized. We identify two key root causes: 1) the prefill phase suffers from suboptimal compute utilization due to wave quantization and attention bottlenecks. 2) hybrid batches disproportionately prioritize latency over throughput, resulting in wasted compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate the issues, we present Bullet, a novel spatial-temporal orchestration system that eliminates these inefficiencies through precise phase coordination. Bullet enables concurrent execution of prefill and decode phases, while dynamically provisioning GPU resources using real-time performance modeling. By integrating SLO-aware scheduling and adaptive resource allocation, Bullet maximizes utilization without compromising latency targets. Experimental evaluations on real-world workloads demonstrate that Bullet delivers 1.26x average throughput gains (up to 1.55x) over state-of-the-arts, while consistently meeting latency constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Temporal Knowledge-Base Creation for Fine-Grained Opinion Analysis with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02363v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a scalable method for constructing a temporal opinion knowledge base with large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators. Despite the demonstrated utility of time-series opinion analysis of text for downstream applications such as forecasting and trend analysis, existing methodologies underexploit this potential due to the absence of temporally grounded fine-grained annotations. Our approach addresses this gap by integrating well-established opinion mining formulations into a declarative LLM annotation pipeline, enabling structured opinion extraction without manual prompt engineering. We define three data models grounded in sentiment and opinion mining literature, serving as schemas for structured representation. We perform rigorous quantitative evaluation of our pipeline using human-annotated test samples. We carry out the final annotations using two separate LLMs, and inter-annotator agreement is computed label-wise across the fine-grained opinion dimensions, analogous to human annotation protocols. The resulting knowledge base encapsulates time-aligned, structured opinions and is compatible with applications in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), temporal question answering, and timeline summarisation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ST-Hyper: Learning High-Order Dependencies Across Multiple Spatial-Temporal Scales for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02217v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, many deep learning based methods have been proposed for modeling dependencies at multiple spatial (inter-variate) or temporal (intra-variate) scales. However, existing methods may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales (ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of 3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Maximum entropy temporal networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02098v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal networks consist of timestamped directed interactions rather than static links. These links may appear continuously in time, yet few studies have directly tackled the continuous-time modeling of networks. Here, we introduce a maximum entropy approach to temporal networks and with basic assumptions on constraints, the corresponding network ensembles admit a modular and interpretable representation: a set of global time processes -- an inhomogeneous Poisson or a Hawkes process -- and a static maximum-entropy (MaxEnt) edge, e.g. node pair, probability. This time-edge labels factorization yields closed-form log-likelihoods, degree/unique-edge expectations, and yields a whole class of effective generative models. We provide maximum-entropy derivation of a log-linear Hawkes/NHPP intensity for temporal networks via functional optimization over path entropy, connecting inhomogeneous Poisson modeling -- e.g., Hawkes models -- to MaxEnt network ensembles. Global Hawkes time layers consistently improve log-likelihood over generic NHPP, while the MaxEnt edge labels recover strength constraints and reproduce expected unique-degree curves. We discuss the limitations of this unified framework and how it could be integrated with calibrated community/motif tools, Hawkes calibration procedures, and (neural) kernel estimation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Sequential Ordinal Models: Application to Invasive Weeds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01976v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multivariate sequential ordinal model is investigated for use in the Bayesian analysis of spatio-temporal ordinal data. The sequential ordinal model likelihood is equivalent to a binary model conditional on unknown regression coefficients and spatio-temporal random effects. Therefore, estimation and prediction in the space-time context can proceed using the well-established dynamic generalised linear model framework. Moreover, the sequential ordinal model avoids the ordering constraints on the threshold parameters that determine the category break points required by cumulative ordinal models, and so simplifies the estimation procedure for high-dimensional space-time applications using Bayesian inference. The dynamic spatio-temporal sequential ordinal model is applied to estimate foliage cover abundance of four actively managed invasive alien species. These invasive weed species are observed by means of a modified Braun-Blanquet score that is commonly used in vegetation studies and constitutes ordinal data. The multivariate ordinal data for the managed weeds species are sparsely distributed in space and time with few observations recorded in high foliage cover categories. A separable model for space-time dependence that maintains parameter interpretability in the presence of aggregated ordinal categories is therefore developed. Estimation and prediction is demonstrated using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) methods developed for univariate spatio-temporal models. Bayesian estimation and prediction shows that the four invasive weed species differentially respond to habitat type, control effort and accessibility, and share similar magnitudes of dependence with short effective spatial ranges and strong temporal autocorrelations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Representation Learning for Real-Time Ultrasound Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01433v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultrasound (US) imaging is a critical tool in medical diagnostics, offering real-time visualization of physiological processes. One of its major advantages is its ability to capture temporal dynamics, which is essential for assessing motion patterns in applications such as cardiac monitoring, fetal development, and vascular imaging. Despite its importance, current deep learning models often overlook the temporal continuity of ultrasound sequences, analyzing frames independently and missing key temporal dependencies. To address this gap, we propose a method for learning effective temporal representations from ultrasound videos, with a focus on echocardiography-based ejection fraction (EF) estimation. EF prediction serves as an ideal case study to demonstrate the necessity of temporal learning, as it requires capturing the rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the heart. Our approach leverages temporally consistent masking and contrastive learning to enforce temporal coherence across video frames, enhancing the model's ability to represent motion patterns. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, our method achieves a substantial improvement in EF prediction accuracy, highlighting the importance of temporally-aware representation learning for real-time ultrasound analysis.</p></details> | ICMl 2025 Workshop |

We use mixed Poisson models to analyze these patterns and to determine the association between mortality rates and various socioeconomic and contextual factors, while controlling for spatial and temporal confounding effects. Our results indicate that a 10% increase in the proportion of people residing in rural areas is associated with an increase of over 5% in male suicide mortality. In addition, a 1% increase in the annual unemployment rate is linked to a 2.4% increase in female suicide mortality. An important finding is that despite male suicide rates consistently being higher than female rates, we observe a notable and steady upward trend in female suicide mortality over the study period.</p></details> |  |

This task is shaped by two challenges: Relevance, ensuring alignment with the query's explicit temporal requirements, and Recency, selecting the freshest document among multiple versions. Existing methods often address the two challenges in isolation, relying on brittle heuristics that fail in scenarios where temporal requirements and staleness resistance are intertwined. To address this gap, we introduce Re2Bench, a benchmark specifically designed to disentangle and evaluate Relevance, Recency, and their hybrid combination. Building on this foundation, we propose Re3, a unified and lightweight framework that dynamically balances semantic and temporal information through a query-aware gating mechanism. On Re2Bench, Re3 achieves state-of-the-art results, leading in R@1 across all three subsets. Ablation studies with backbone sensitivity tests confirm robustness, showing strong generalization across diverse encoders and real-world settings. This work provides both a generalizable solution and a principled evaluation suite, advancing the development of temporally aware retrieval systems.

| **[Temporal Preference Optimization for Long-Form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13919v3)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in video large multimodal models (video-LMMs), achieving effective temporal grounding in long-form videos remains a challenge for existing models. To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework designed to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through preference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to differentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by leveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal grounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal grounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video sequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly enhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated data. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness of TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO establishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark, underscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for advancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

However, most existing planners rely on a fixed, pre-specified horizon during both training and inference. This rigidity often produces length-mismatch (trajectories that are too short or too long) and brittle performance across instances with varying geometric or dynamical difficulty. In this paper, we introduce the Variable Horizon Diffuser (VHD) framework, which treats the horizon as a learned variable rather than a fixed hyperparameter. Given a start-goal pair, we first predict an instance-specific horizon using a learned Length Predictor model, which guides a Diffusion Planner to generate a trajectory of the desired length. Our design maintains compatibility with existing diffusion planners by controlling trajectory length through initial noise shaping and training on randomly cropped sub-trajectories, without requiring architectural changes. Empirically, VHD improves success rates and path efficiency in maze-navigation and robot-arm control benchmarks, showing greater robustness to horizon mismatch and unseen lengths, while keeping training simple and offline-only.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods, however, often struggle to capture the full richness of these dynamics, particularly the co-existence of multi-scale interactions and the diverse behaviors of heterogeneous agents. To address these challenges, this paper introduces HeLoFusion, an efficient and scalable encoder for modeling heterogeneous and multi-scale agent interactions. Instead of relying on global context, HeLoFusion constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each agent, allowing it to effectively model both direct pairwise dependencies and complex group-wise interactions (\textit{e.g.}, platooning vehicles or pedestrian crowds). Furthermore, HeLoFusion tackles the critical challenge of agent heterogeneity through an aggregation-decomposition message-passing scheme and type-specific feature networks, enabling it to learn nuanced, type-dependent interaction patterns. This locality-focused approach enables a principled representation of multi-level social context, yielding powerful and expressive agent embeddings. On the challenging Waymo Open Motion Dataset, HeLoFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting new benchmarks for key metrics including Soft mAP and minADE. Our work demonstrates that a locality-grounded architecture, which explicitly models multi-scale and heterogeneous interactions, is a highly effective strategy for advancing motion forecasting.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory and communication optimization for low-altitude air-ground cooperation systems, where mobile unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) upload data to UAVs. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to maximize the minimal sum-rate of UGVs while ensuring quality of service and navigation constraints. The proposed algorithm integrates a successive convex approximation (SCA)-penalty method for UGV-UAV scheduling, an SCA-based approach for UGV transmit power control, and a novel warm-start particle swarm optimization with cross mutation (WS-PSO-CM). The WS-PSO-CM leverages convex optimization results from a statistical channel model to initialize particle swarm, significantly improving the performance, compared with celebrated PSO-CM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a $45.8$\% higher minimal sum-rate compared to the baseline PSO-CM under the same iterations. This gain can be translated to reducing computational time by $46.7$\% of PSO-CM. Furthermore, our simulation results reveal that UAVs dynamically adjust trajectories to avoid interference by buildings, and maintain proximity to UGVs to mitigate path-loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 7 figures; accepted by GC-2026-Workshops</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Frame-wise Tracking: A Trajectory-based Paradigm for Efficient Point Cloud Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11453v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation, TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers.

Recently, large-scale pretrained foundation models have been leveraged as shared priors for perception, reasoning, and action, enabling zero-shot VLN without task-specific training. However, existing zero-shot VLN methods depend on costly perception and passive scene understanding, collapsing control to point-level choices. As a result, they are expensive to deploy, misaligned in action semantics, and short-sighted in planning. To address these issues, we present DreamNav that focuses on the following three aspects: (1) for reducing sensory cost, our EgoView Corrector aligns viewpoints and stabilizes egocentric perception; (2) instead of point-level actions, our Trajectory Predictor favors global trajectory-level planning to better align with instruction semantics; and (3) to enable anticipatory and long-horizon planning, we propose an Imagination Predictor to endow the agent with proactive thinking capability. On VLN-CE and real-world tests, DreamNav sets a new zero-shot state-of-the-art (SOTA), outperforming the strongest egocentric baseline with extra information by up to 7.49\% and 18.15\% in terms of SR and SPL metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first zero-shot VLN method to unify trajectory-level planning and active imagination while using only egocentric inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tracailer: An Efficient Trajectory Planner for Tractor-Trailer Robots in Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19832v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tractor-trailer robot consists of a drivable tractor and one or more non-drivable trailers connected via hitches. Compared to typical car-like robots, the addition of trailers provides greater transportation capability. However, this also complicates motion planning due to the robot's complex kinematics, high-dimensional state space, and deformable structure. To efficiently plan safe, time-optimal trajectories that adhere to the kinematic constraints of the robot and address the challenges posed by its unique features, this paper introduces a lightweight, compact, and high-order smooth trajectory representation for tractor-trailer robots. Based on it, we design an efficiently solvable spatial-temporal trajectory optimization problem. To deal with deformable structures, which leads to difficulties in collision avoidance, we fully leverage the collisionfree regions of the environment, directly applying deformations to trajectories in continuous space. This approach not requires constructing safe regions from the environment using convex approximations through collision-free seed points before each optimization, avoiding the loss of the solution space, thus reducing the dependency of the optimization on initial values. Moreover, a multi-terminal fast path search algorithm is proposed to generate the initial values for optimization. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves severalfold improvements in efficiency compared to existing algorithms, while also ensuring lower curvature and trajectory duration. Real-world experiments involving the transportation, loading and unloading of goods in both indoor and outdoor scenarios further validate the effectiveness of our method.

Existing methods struggle with sparse data, incomplete routes, and limited modeling of complex spatial dependencies, often relying on low-level check-in data or ignoring spatial patterns. In this paper, we introduced GCN-TULHOR, a method that transforms raw location data into higher-order mobility flow representations using hexagonal tessellation, reducing data sparsity and capturing richer spatial semantics, and integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Our approach converts both sparse check-in and continuous GPS trajectory data into unified higher-order flow representations, mitigating sparsity while capturing deeper semantic information. The GCN layer explicitly models complex spatial relationships and non-local dependencies without requiring side information such as timestamps or points of interest. Experiments on six real-world datasets show consistent improvements over classical baselines, RNN- and Transformer-based models, and the TULHOR method in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. GCN-TULHOR achieves 1-8% relative gains in accuracy and F1. Sensitivity analysis identifies an optimal setup with a single GCN layer and 512-dimensional embeddings. The integration of GCNs enhances spatial learning and improves generalizability across mobility data. This work highlights the value of combining graph-based spatial learning with sequential modeling, offering a robust and scalable solution for TUL with applications in recommendations, urban planning, and security.</p></details> |  |

The new estimate is $O(N^{-1/2})$, with a constant related to the probability of success of the bound, given by Hoeffding's inequality, similar to other methodologies, such as Philipp et al. Furthermore, we propose a \textit{lifting back} operator to obtain trajectories generated by embedding the initial state and iterating a linear system in a higher dimension. This naturally yields an $O(N^{-1/2})$ error bound for mean trajectories. Finally, we show numerical results including an example of nonlinear system, exhibiting successful approximation with exponential decay faster than $-1/2$, as suggested by the theoretical results.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

To improve prediction accuracy, recent approaches often rely on pre-built high-definition (HD) maps or real-time local map construction modules to incorporate static environmental information. However, pre-built HD maps are limited to specific regions and cannot adapt to transient changes. In addition, local map construction modules, which recognize only predefined elements, may fail to capture critical scene details or introduce errors that degrade prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Bird's-Eye View Trajectory Prediction (BEVTraj), a novel trajectory prediction framework that operates directly in the bird's-eye view (BEV) space utilizing real-time sensor data without relying on any pre-built maps. The BEVTraj leverages deformable attention to efficiently extract relevant context from dense BEV features. Furthermore, we introduce a Sparse Goal Candidate Proposal (SGCP) module, which enables full end-to-end prediction without requiring any post-processing steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the BEVTraj achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art HD map-based models while offering greater flexibility by eliminating the dependency on pre-built maps.

| **[Linguistic trajectories of bipolar disorder on social media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10035v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language provides valuable markers of affective disorders such as bipolar disorder (BD), yet clinical assessments remain limited in scale. In response, analyses of social media (SM) language have gained prominence due to their high temporal resolution and longitudinal scope. Here, we introduce a method to determine the timing of users' diagnoses and apply it to study language trajectories from 3 years before to 21 years after BD diagnosis - contrasted with uses reporting unipolar depression (UD) and non-affected users (HC). We show that BD diagnosis is accompanied by pervasive linguistic alterations reflecting mood disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, substance abuse, hospitalization, medical comorbidities, unusual thought content, and disorganized thought. We further observe recurring mood-related language changes across two decades after the diagnosis, with a pronounced 12-month periodicity suggestive of seasonal mood episodes. Finally, trend-level evidence suggests an increased periodicity in users estimated to be female. In sum, our findings provide evidence for language alterations in the acute and chronic phase of BD. This validates and extends recent efforts leveraging SM for scalable monitoring of mental health.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory: Efficient Imitation Learning via Safe Self-augmentation with Demonstrator-annotated Precision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09893v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning is a promising paradigm for training robot agents; however, standard approaches typically require substantial data acquisition -- via numerous demonstrations or random exploration -- to ensure reliable performance. Although exploration reduces human effort, it lacks safety guarantees and often results in frequent collisions -- particularly in clearance-limited tasks (e.g., peg-in-hole) -- thereby, necessitating manual environmental resets and imposing additional human burden. This study proposes Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory (SART), a framework that enables policy learning from a single human demonstration, while safely expanding the dataset through autonomous augmentation. SART consists of two stages: (1) human teaching only once, where a single demonstration is provided and precision boundaries -- represented as spheres around key waypoints -- are annotated, followed by one environment reset; (2) robot self-augmentation, where the robot generates diverse, collision-free trajectories within these boundaries and reconnects to the original demonstration. This design improves the data collection efficiency by minimizing human effort while ensuring safety. Extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world manipulation tasks show that SART achieves substantially higher success rates than policies trained solely on human-collected demonstrations.

Existing methods typically rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets. Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification, which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and zero-shot approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Foundation Models for Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10570v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction serves as a critical functionality in autonomous driving, enabling the anticipation of future motion paths for traffic participants such as vehicles and pedestrians, which is essential for driving safety. Although conventional deep learning methods have improved accuracy, they remain hindered by inherent limitations, including lack of interpretability, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated data, and weak generalization in long-tail scenarios. The rise of Large Foundation Models (LFMs) is transforming the research paradigm of trajectory prediction. This survey offers a systematic review of recent advances in LFMs, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for trajectory prediction. By integrating linguistic and scene semantics, LFMs facilitate interpretable contextual reasoning, significantly enhancing prediction safety and generalization in complex environments. The article highlights three core methodologies: trajectory-language mapping, multimodal fusion, and constraint-based reasoning. It covers prediction tasks for both vehicles and pedestrians, evaluation metrics, and dataset analyses. Key challenges such as computational latency, data scarcity, and real-world robustness are discussed, along with future research directions including low-latency inference, causality-aware modeling, and motion foundation models.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Occupancy-aware Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Valet Parking in Uncertain Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09206v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately reasoning about future parking spot availability and integrated planning is critical for enabling safe and efficient autonomous valet parking in dynamic, uncertain environments. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on instantaneous observations or static assumptions, we present an approach that predicts future parking spot occupancy by explicitly distinguishing between initially vacant and occupied spots, and by leveraging the predicted motion of dynamic agents. We introduce a probabilistic spot occupancy estimator that incorporates partial and noisy observations within a limited Field-of-View (FoV) model and accounts for the evolving uncertainty of unobserved regions. Coupled with this, we design a strategy planner that adaptively balances goal-directed parking maneuvers with exploratory navigation based on information gain, and intelligently incorporates wait-and-go behaviors at promising spots. Through randomized simulations emulating large parking lots, we demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parking efficiency, safety margins, and trajectory smoothness compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[MGTraj: Multi-Granularity Goal-Guided Human Trajectory Prediction with Recursive Refinement Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09200v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities: coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.</p></details> |  |

If a planned trajectory violates traffic rules, it is common to replan a new trajectory from scratch. We instead propose a trajectory repair technique to save computation time. By coupling satisfiability modulo theories with set-based reachability analysis, we determine if and in what manner the initial trajectory can be repaired. Experiments in high-fidelity simulators and in the real world demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach in various scenarios. Even in complex environments with intricate rules, we efficiently and reliably repair rule-violating trajectories, enabling automated vehicles to swiftly resume legally safe operation in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE.

Existing methods often face high computational cost or rely on external safety critics. To address this, we propose an Interaction-Enriched Unified Potential Field (IUPF) framework that fuses style-dependent benefit and risk fields through a physics-inspired variational model, grounded in mean field game theory. The approach captures conservative, aggressive, and cooperative behaviors without additional safety modules, and employs stochastic differential equations to guarantee Nash equilibrium with exponential convergence. Simulations on lane changing and overtaking scenarios show that IUPF ensures safe distances, generates smooth and efficient trajectories, and outperforms traditional optimization and game-theoretic baselines in both adaptability and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

| **[Real-Time Gradient Waveform Design for Arbitrary $k$-Space Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21625v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>\textbf{Objective: }To develop a real-time method for designing gradient waveforms for arbitrary $k$-space trajectories that are time-optimal and hardware-compliant. \textbf{Methods: }The gradient waveform is solved recursively under both the slew-rate and the trajectory constraints. The gradient constraint is enforced by thresholding the $\ell_2$-norm of the next gradient vector. The constraints form a quadratic equation. To ensure the existence of the solution, a novel Discrete-Time Forward and Backward Sweep (DTFBS) strategy is proposed. To ensure the existence of the trajectory derivatives, the trajectory function is reparameterized as a piecewise cubic polynomial function with $C^2$ continuity. To ensure trajectory fidelity, the output gradient waveform is reparameterized by the finite difference of the trajectory samples. Simulation experiments across seven commonly adopted non-Cartesian trajectories were conducted to validate generality, time-optimality, real-time capability, slew-rate accuracy, and improvements over prior work. Imaging feasibility of the designed time-optimal gradient waveform was validated in phantom and in vivo experiments. \textbf{Results: }The proposed method achieves a $>89\%$ reduction in computation time and simultaneously reduces slew-rate overshoot by $>98\%$ compared to the prior method across all involved trajectories. The computation time of the proposed method is shorter than the gradient duration for all tested cases, validating the real-time capability of the proposed method. \textbf{Conclusions: }The proposed method enables real-time and hardware-compliant gradient waveform design, achieving significant reductions in computation time and slew-rate overshoot compared to the previous method. \textbf{Significance: }This is the first method achieving real-time gradient waveform design for arbitrary $k$-space trajectories.</p></details> |  |

While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Generalized Hamiltonian Dynamics with Stability from Noisy Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07280v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative, and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics, appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction accuracy with bounded uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often assume fixed graph structures and require retraining when network conditions change, making them unsuitable for deployment on constrained hardware. We present TrajAware, an RL-based framework designed for edge AI deployment in VANETs. TrajAware integrates three components: (i) action space pruning, which reduces redundant neighbour options while preserving two-hop reachability, alleviating the curse of dimensionality; (ii) graph cross-attention, which maps pruned neighbours to the global graph context, producing features that generalise across diverse network sizes; and (iii) trajectory-aware prediction, which uses historical routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial observations. We evaluate TrajAware in the open-source SUMO simulator using real-world city maps with a leave-one-city-out setup. Results show that TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Resident fitness computation in linear time and other algorithmic aspects of interacting trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11561v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The notion of a system of interacting trajectories was recently introduced by Hermann, Gonz\'alez Casanova, Soares dos Santos, T\'obi\'as and Wakolbinger. Such a system of $[0,1]$-valued piecewise linear trajectories arises as a scaling limit of the system of logarithmic subpopulation sizes in a population-genetic model (more precisely, a Moran model) with mutation and selection. By definition, the resident fitness is initially 0 and afterwards it increases by the ultimate slope of each trajectory that reaches height 1. We show that although the interaction of $n$ trajectories may yield $\Omega(n^2)$ slope changes in total, the resident fitness function can be computed algorithmically in $O(n)$ time. Our algorithm uses the so-called continued lines representation of the system of interacting trajectories. In the special case of Poissonian interacting trajectories where the birth times of the trajectories form a Poisson process and the initial slopes are random and i.i.d., we provide a linear bound on the expected total number of slope changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v5)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

| **[Statistical description and dimension reduction of categorical trajectories with multivariate functional principal components](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09986v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many examples in which the statistical units of interest are samples of a continuous time categorical random process, that is to say a continuous time stochastic process taking values in a finite state space. Getting simple representations that allow comparisons of a set of trajectories is of major interest for statisticians. Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical description of the categorical trajectories into a multivariate functional principal components analysis. The (multivariate) covariance operator has nice interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities and the multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, it is simple to build consistent estimators of the covariance kernel and perform multivariate functional principal components analysis. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories are not supposed to be continuous and can be observed exhaustively. The approach is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments. We also show how it can be easily extended to analyze experiments, such as temporal check-all-that-apply, in which two states or more can be observed at the same time.</p></details> |  |

This growing deployment presents new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments. However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM) reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate, collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the low-altitude economy networking.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior learning-based methods, ZLATTE leverages Vision-Language Models to register objects as geometric primitives and employs a Large Language Model to translate natural language instructions into explicit geometric and kinematic constraints. These constraints are integrated into a potential field optimization to adapt initial trajectories while preserving feasibility and safety. A multi-agent strategy further enhances robustness under complex or conflicting commands. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that ZLATTE achieves smoother, safer, and more interpretable trajectory modifications compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Scaling of Diffusion Models via Noise Trajectory Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03164v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The iterative and stochastic nature of diffusion models enables test-time scaling, whereby spending additional compute during denoising generates higher-fidelity samples. Increasing the number of denoising steps is the primary scaling axis, but this yields quickly diminishing returns. Instead optimizing the noise trajectory--the sequence of injected noise vectors--is promising, as the specific noise realizations critically affect sample quality; but this is challenging due to a high-dimensional search space, complex noise-outcome interactions, and costly trajectory evaluations. We address this by first casting diffusion as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a terminal reward, showing tree-search methods such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to be meaningful but impractical. To balance performance and efficiency, we then resort to a relaxation of MDP, where we view denoising as a sequence of independent contextual bandits. This allows us to introduce an $\epsilon$-greedy search algorithm that globally explores at extreme timesteps and locally exploits during the intermediate steps where de-mixing occurs. Experiments on EDM and Stable Diffusion reveal state-of-the-art scores for class-conditioned/text-to-image generation, exceeding baselines by up to $164\%$ and matching/exceeding MCTS performance. To our knowledge, this is the first practical method for test-time noise trajectory optimization of arbitrary (non-differentiable) rewards.</p></details> |  |
| **[MENSA: A Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis with Trajectory-based Likelihood Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06525v4)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing time-to-event methods focus on either single-event or competing-risk settings, leaving multi-event scenarios relatively underexplored. In many real-world applications, the same patient may experience multiple events that are non-exclusive, and sometimes semi-competing. A common workaround is to train separate single-event models, but this approach fails to exploit dependencies and shared structure across events. To address these limitations, we propose MENSA (Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis), a deep learning model that jointly models flexible time-to-event distributions for multiple events, whether competing or co-occurring. In addition, we introduce a novel trajectory-based likelihood that captures the temporal ordering between events. Across five benchmark datasets, MENSA consistently improves prediction performance over many state-of-the-art baselines.

While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity, computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present the Efficient Virtuoso, a conditional latent diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, achieving a minimum Average Displacement Error (minADE) of 0.25. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.</p></details> |  |

We assume that we are given a path in the form of a set of line segments that the end-effector should follow. We also assume that we have a method to solve the inverse kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector. Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by reducing the problem to a shortest-path problem of the graph and applying Dijkstra's algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by experiments.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Learning to Coordinate: Distributed Meta-Trajectory Optimization Via Differentiable ADMM-DDP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01630v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Acceleration Preconditioners for Parametric Radiative Transfer Equations based on Trajectory-Aware Reduced Order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05001v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The parametric radiative transfer equation (RTE) arises in multi-query applications, such as design optimization, inverse problems, and uncertainty quantification, which require solving the RTE multiple times for various parameters. Classical synthetic acceleration (SA) preconditioners are designed based on low-order approximations of a kinetic correction equation, e.g., its diffusion limit in diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA). Despite their widespread success, these methods rely on empirical physical assumptions and do not leverage low-rank structures across parameters of the parametric problem. To address these limitations, our previous work introduced a reduced-order model (ROM) enhanced preconditioner called ROMSAD, which exploits low-rank structures across parameters and the original kinetic description of the correction equation. While ROMSAD improves overall efficiency compared with DSA, its efficiency reduces after the first iteration, because the construction of the underlying ROM ignores the preconditioner-dependence of the residual trajectory, leading to a mismatch between the offline and online residual trajectories. To overcome this issue, we introduce a trajectory-aware framework that iteratively constructs ROMs to eliminate the mismatch between offline and online residual trajectories. Numerical tests demonstrate superior efficiency over DSA, and substantial gains in both efficiency and robustness over ROMSAD. For a parametric lattice problem, trajectory-aware ROM preconditioners achieve rapid convergence within only $2$-$3$ iterations online.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |

While human-motion-centric approaches excel in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods. Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.</p></details> |  |

STO maintains the maneuver strategy of the high-level global planner while allowing curvature discontinuities at switching points to improve maneuver efficiency. To ensure safety, a convex corridor is constructed via GJK-accelerated ellipse shrinking and expansion, serving as safety constraints in each iteration. Numerical simulations in perpendicular and reverse-angled parking scenarios demonstrate that STO enhances maneuver efficiency while ensuring safety. Moreover, computational performance confirms its practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Robust Offline Imitation Learning Through State-level Trajectory Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22524v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning (IL) has proven effective for enabling robots to acquire visuomotor skills through expert demonstrations. However, traditional IL methods are limited by their reliance on high-quality, often scarce, expert data, and suffer from covariate shift. To address these challenges, recent advances in offline IL have incorporated suboptimal, unlabeled datasets into the training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance policy learning from mixed-quality offline datasets by leveraging task-relevant trajectory fragments and rich environmental dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a state-based search framework that stitches state-action pairs from imperfect demonstrations, generating more diverse and informative training trajectories. Experimental results on standard IL benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks showcase that our proposed method significantly improves both generalization and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can the Waymo Open Motion Dataset Support Realistic Behavioral Modeling? A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03515v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations. Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably, WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving. Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without proper validation against independently collected data.</p></details> |  |

For control purposes, the model is structured as a cascade system, where a rotational subsystem drives a translational one. The rotational subsystem is linear, while the translational subsystem follows a linear-plus-perturbation form, thereby reducing the complexity of control design. A control strategy requiring only simple operations, no memory, and no iterative search loops is presented to illustrate the main features of the GA model. By employing GA to model both translations and rotations, a singularity-free and geometrically intuitive representation can be achieved through the use of the geometric product. Closed-loop stability is rigorously established using input-to-state stability methods. Numerical simulations of a quad tilt-rotorcraft performing trajectory tracking in a windy environment validate the controller's stability and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE TAES for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[KEPT: Knowledge-Enhanced Prediction of Trajectories from Consecutive Driving Frames with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02966v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars. Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion, and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset, KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising, data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

How about solving such a problem at an incredibly fast computational time? On a small form-factor processor? Algorithmic details that make possible this trifecta of breakthroughs are presented in this paper. The computational mathematics that deliver these advancements are: (i) a Birkhoff-theoretic discretization of optimal control problems, (ii) matrix-free linear algebra leveraging Krylov-subspace methods, and (iii) a near-perfect Birkhoff preconditioner that helps achieve $\mathcal{O}(1)$ iteration speed with respect to the grid size,~$N$. A key enabler of this high performance is the computation of Birkhoff matrix-vector products at $\mathcal{O}(N\log(N))$ time using fast Fourier transform techniques that eliminate traditional computational bottlenecks. A numerical demonstration of this unprecedented scale and speed is illustrated for a practical astrodynamics problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, AAS Paper 25-689</p></details> |
| **[Multi-vessel Interaction-Aware Trajectory Prediction and Collision Risk Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01836v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is essential for enhancing situational awareness and preventing collisions. Still, existing data-driven models are constrained mainly to single-vessel forecasting, overlooking vessel interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to strengthen maritime safety and decision support.</p></details> |  |

An MPC strategy based on a 12-dimensional prediction model is proposed for the outer loop, explicitly accounting for time-varying coupled constraints, where multiple variables are interdependent and need to be handled together. The outer-loop controller generates an acceleration reference, which is then converted into attitude and angular velocity references, later tracked by a nonlinear inner-loop controller. Numerical simulations validate the approach, demonstrating enhanced performance in precise and fast tracking by imposing less conservative constraints than existing approaches, while still guaranteeing stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, submitted to 2025 IEEE 64th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)</p></details> |
| **[Relative Trajectory Balance is equivalent to Trust-PCL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01632v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in generative modeling has highlighted the importance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning, with KL-regularized methods in particular proving to be highly effective for both autoregressive and diffusion models. Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB) objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an illustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods achieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was previously reported.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using iterated local alignment to aggregate trajectory data into a traffic flow map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17500v6)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectories are a promising GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data source to compute multi-scale traffic flow maps ranging from the city/regional level to the road level. The main obstacle is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for city level, large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial difficulties for road level, small-scale aggregation. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales for static and interactive maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedResearcher-R1: Expert-Level Medical Deep Researcher via A Knowledge-Informed Trajectory Synthesis Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14880v3)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown impressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research systems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking and synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored for medical contexts. We present a medical deep research agent that addresses these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool interactions. Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Metamorphic Testing of Multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01294v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Predicting human trajectories is crucial for the safety and reliability of autonomous systems, such as automated vehicles and mobile robots. However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g., trajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs (multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary difficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future trajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This research presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic methodology for testing multimodal HTP systems. We address the oracle problem through metamorphic relations (MRs) adapted for the complexities and stochastic nature of HTP. Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both historical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an environmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric transformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and map inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2) Map-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing obstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions. We propose probabilistic violation criteria based on distance metrics between probability distributions, such as the Wasserstein or Hellinger distance. Conclusion: This study introduces tool, a MT framework for the oracle-less testing of multimodal, stochastic HTP systems. It allows for assessment of model robustness against input transformations and contextual changes without reliance on ground-truth trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Infor...</summary><p>Information and Software Technology</p></details> |

An innovative geometric indicator, based on the analysis of safety zones using adaptive ellipses, is used to accurately quantify collision risks. Our method applies the Shoelace formula to compute the intersection area in the case of misaligned and time-varying configurations. Comfort is modeled using indicators centered on longitudinal and lateral jerk, while efficiency is assessed by overall travel time. These criteria are aggregated into a comprehensive objective function solved using a PSO based algorithm. The approach was successfully validated under real traffic conditions via experiments conducted in an urban intersection involving an autonomous vehicle interacting with a human-operated vehicle, and in simulation using data recorded from human driving in real traffic.</p></details> |  |

End-to-end methods that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association. MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition, MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

While existing trajectory planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i) a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives, providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.</p></details> |  |

Although data acquisition using drones is efficient, existing datasets still have limitations in scene representativeness, information richness, and data fidelity. This study introduces FLUID, comprising a fine-grained trajectory dataset that captures dense conflicts at typical urban signalized intersections, and a lightweight, full-pipeline framework for drone-based trajectory processing. FLUID covers three distinct intersection types, with approximately 5 hours of recording time and featuring over 20,000 TPs across 8 categories. Notably, the dataset averages two vehicle conflicts per minute, involving roughly 25% of all motor vehicles. FLUID provides comprehensive data, including trajectories, traffic signals, maps, and raw videos. Comparison with the DataFromSky platform and ground-truth measurements validates its high spatio-temporal accuracy.

However, most deep learning methods either consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions. While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e. predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports $3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.</p></details> |  |

Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory. This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate superior visual quality compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8page...</summary><p>8pages; 7figures; 4 tables</p></details> |

This conservative approach severely underutilizes the robot's inherent capabilities -- our analysis demonstrates that manipulators can safely handle payloads well above nominal capacity across broad regions of their workspace while staying within joint angle, velocity, acceleration, and torque limits. To address this gap between assumed and actual capability, we propose a novel trajectory generation approach using denoising diffusion models that explicitly incorporates payload constraints into the planning process. Unlike traditional sampling-based methods that rely on inefficient trial-and-error, optimization-based methods that are prohibitively slow, or kinodynamic planners that struggle with problem dimensionality, our approach generates dynamically feasible joint-space trajectories in constant time that can be directly executed on physical hardware without post-processing. Experimental validation on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that up to 67.6% of the workspace remains accessible even with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal capacity. This expanded operational envelope highlights the importance of a more nuanced consideration of payload dynamics in motion planning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 Conference on Robot Learning [CoRL]</p></details> |
| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manifold Trajectories in Next-Token Prediction: From Replicator Dynamics to Softmax Equilibrium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21186v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.</p></details> |  |

This research evaluates 13 trajectory reconstruction methods, including several novel approaches, using high-resolution AVL data from Austin, Texas. We examine the interplay of four critical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on reconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of these methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the trade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework combines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity with practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning velocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed variability). In addition, we provide insight into the relative value of each method in calculating realistic metrics for infrastructure evaluations. Our findings indicate that velocity-aware methods consistently outperform position-only approaches. Interestingly, we discovered that smoothing-based methods can degrade overall performance in complex, congested urban environments, although enforcing monotonicity remains critical. The velocity constrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME) yields optimal results, offering a balance between high accuracy and computational efficiency. Its minimal overhead makes it suitable for both historical analysis and real-time applications, providing significant predictive power when combined with dense datasets. These findings offer practical guidance for researchers and practitioners implementing trajectory reconstruction systems and emphasize the importance of investing in higher-frequency AVL data collection for improved analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeMat-Traj: A Scalable and Unified Dataset of Materials Trajectories for Atomistic Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20875v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs. LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LeMaterial/LeMat-Traj and https://github.com/LeMaterial/lematerial-fetcher.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Trajectory Prediction via Rule-Regularized Heteroscedastic Deep Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13111v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher.

The investigation of these dynamics can provide a better understanding of diffusing objects and their surrounding media, but a quantitative characterization from individual trajectories is often challenging. Efforts devoted to improving anomalous diffusion detection using classical statistics and machine learning have produced several new methods. Recently, the anomalous diffusion challenge (AnDi, www.andi-challenge.org) was launched to objectively assess these approaches on a common dataset, focusing on three aspects of anomalous diffusion: the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent; the classification of the diffusion model; and the segmentation of trajectories. In this article, I describe a simple approach to tackle the tasks of the AnDi challenge by combining extreme learning machine and feature engineering (AnDi-ELM). The method reaches satisfactory performance while offering a straightforward implementation and fast training time with limited computing resources, making it a suitable tool for fast preliminary screening of anomalous diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Ego-centric Predictive Model Conditioned on Hand Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19852v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In egocentric scenarios, anticipating both the next action and its visual outcome is essential for understanding human-object interactions and for enabling robotic planning. However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly modeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action prediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual scene, while video prediction models generate future frames without conditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or contextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified two-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in egocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we perform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual observations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce causal cross-attention to fuse multi-modal cues, leveraging inferred action signals to guide an image-based Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for frame-by-frame future video generation. Our approach is the first unified model designed to handle both egocentric human activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit predictions of both upcoming actions and their visual consequences. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both action prediction and future video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: github.com/showlab/Ego-PM</p></details> |

To provide an optimized solution, we propose a cooperative trajectory optimization and task allocation framework leveraging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). This study integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for efficient task allocation among multiple UAVs and UGVs, and employs an informed-RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) algorithm for collision-free trajectory generation. Further optimization of task sequencing and path efficiency is conducted using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Simulation experiments conducted in a realistic post-disaster environment demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves the overall efficiency of medical rescue operations compared to traditional strategies. Specifically, our method reduces the total mission completion time to 26.7 minutes for a 15-task scenario, outperforming K-Means clustering and random allocation by over 73%. Furthermore, the framework achieves a substantial 15.1% reduction in total traveled distance after CMA-ES optimization. The cooperative utilization of UAVs and UGVs effectively balances their complementary advantages, highlighting the system's scalability and practicality for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Trust Region Sequential Convex Optimization for Multi-Drone Thermal Screening Trajectory Planning in Urban Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06012v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is essential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas.

| **[Coresets from Trajectories: Selecting Data via Correlation of Loss Differences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20230v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k, CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with <1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints, incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled, efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion: Real-Time Trajectory Planning with Just-Enough Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12166v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots equipped with rich sensor suites can localize reliably in partially-observable environments, but powering every sensor continuously is wasteful and often infeasible. Belief-space planners address this by propagating pose-belief covariance through analytic models and switching sensors heuristically--a brittle, runtime-expensive approach. Data-driven approaches--including diffusion models--learn multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, but presuppose an accurate, always-on state estimate. We address the largely open problem: for a given task in a mapped environment, which \textit{minimal sensor subset} must be active at each location to maintain state uncertainty \textit{just low enough} to complete the task? Our key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error. Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion (B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for localisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this single proxy suffices for a soft-actor-critic to choose sensors online, optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth. We deploy B-COD in real-time marine trials on an unmanned surface vehicle and show that it reduces sensing energy consumption while matching the goal-reach performance of an always-on baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025 (Conference on Robot Learning)</p></details> |

The task of predicting pedestrian crossing intention involves determining whether pedestrians in the scene are likely to cross the road or not. In this work, we propose TrajFusionNet, a novel transformer-based model that combines future pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed predictions as priors for predicting crossing intention. TrajFusionNet comprises two branches: a Sequence Attention Module (SAM) and a Visual Attention Module (VAM). The SAM branch learns from a sequential representation of the observed and predicted pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed. Complementarily, the VAM branch enables learning from a visual representation of the predicted pedestrian trajectory by overlaying predicted pedestrian bounding boxes onto scene images. By utilizing a small number of lightweight modalities, TrajFusionNet achieves the lowest total inference time (including model runtime and data preprocessing) among current state-of-the-art approaches. In terms of performance, it achieves state-of-the-art results across the three most commonly used datasets for pedestrian crossing intention prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[GTPO: Trajectory-Based Policy Optimization in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03772v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline (TAP), a scalable and automated method for extracting SDL labels from large trajectory datasets. TAP applies a rules-based cross-entropy optimization approach to learn parameters directly from data, enhancing generalization across diverse driving contexts. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), TAP achieves 30% greater precision than Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 24% over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in identifying behaviorally similar trajectories. Additionally, TAP enables automated detection of unique driving behaviors, streamlining safety evaluation processes for AV testing. This work provides a foundation for scalable scenario-based AV behavior analysis, with potential extensions for integrating multi-agent contexts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Medical doctors guide these conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including annotation guidelines, publicly available at https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Preliminary Study on Space Utilization and Emergent Behaviors of Group vs. Single Pedestrians in Real-World Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18939v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process. To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change, motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single, single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200 frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space design validation in crowd dynamics research.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as 3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics, STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

However, it is challenging to cooperatively deploy multiple UAV swarms in large-scale remote areas. Hence, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical UAV swarms structure for 6G aerial access networks, where the head UAVs serve as aerial BSs, and tail UAVs (T-UAVs) are responsible for relay. In detail, we jointly optimize the dynamic deployment and trajectory of UAV swarms, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) to concurrently minimize the energy consumption of UAV swarms and GUs, as well as the delay of GUs. However, the proposed MOP is a mixed integer nonlinear programming and NP-hard to solve. Therefore, we develop a K-means and Voronoi diagram based area division method, and construct Fermat points to establish connections between GUs and T-UAVs. Then, an improved non-dominated sorting whale optimization algorithm is proposed to seek Pareto optimal solutions for the transformed MOP. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the performance of proposed algorithms by comparing with baseline mechanisms, resulting in a 50% complexity reduction.</p></details> |  |

Our framework features a unified trajectory representation that encapsulates the kinematic models of both $SO(3)\times\mathbb{R}^3$ and $SE(3)$ pose representations. This encapsulation strategy allows users to use the same implementation of measurement-based factors for either choice of pose representation, which facilitates experimentation and comparison to achieve the best model for the ME task. In addition, unique to our framework, we derive the kinematic models with the closed-form temporal derivatives of the local variable of $SO(3)$ and $SE(3)$, which so far has only been approximated based on the Taylor expansion in the literature. Our experiments show that these kinematic models can improve the estimation accuracy in high-speed scenarios. All analytical Jacobians of the interpolated states with respect to the support states of the trajectory representation, as well as the motion prior factors, are also provided for accelerated Gauss-Newton (GN) optimization. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the framework in various motion estimation tasks such as localization, calibration, and odometry, facilitating fast prototyping for ME researchers.

Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by 32.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website is at: https://denghaoyuan123.github.io/SafeBimanip/</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce the FlexiSteps Network (FSN), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts prediction output time steps based on varying contextual conditions. Inspired by recent advancements addressing observation length discrepancies and dynamic feature extraction, FSN incorporates an pre-trained Adaptive Prediction Module (APM) to evaluate and adjust the output steps dynamically, ensuring optimal prediction accuracy and efficiency. To guarantee the plug-and-play of our FSN, we also design a Dynamic Decoder(DD). Additionally, to balance the prediction time steps and prediction accuracy, we design a scoring mechanism, which not only introduces the Fr\'echet distance to evaluate the geometric similarity between the predicted trajectories and the ground truth trajectories but the length of predicted steps is also considered. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including Argoverse and INTERACTION demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed FSN framework.</p></details> |  |

However, existing works suffer from the generalization problem, \ie, they are either restricted to train for specific regions or only suitable for a few tasks. Given the recent advances of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we raise the question: can MLLMs reform current trajectory data mining and solve the problem? Nevertheless, due to the modality gap of trajectory, how to generate task-independent multimodal trajectory representations and how to adapt flexibly to different tasks remain the foundational challenges. In this paper, we propose \texttt{Traj-MLLM}}, which is the first general framework using MLLMs for trajectory data mining. By integrating multiview contexts, \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} transforms raw trajectories into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving key spatial-temporal characteristics, and directly utilizes the reasoning ability of MLLMs for trajectory analysis. Additionally, a prompt optimization method is proposed to finalize data-invariant prompts for task adaptation. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets show that \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $48.05\%$, $15.52\%$, $51.52\%$, $1.83\%$ on travel time estimation, mobility prediction, anomaly detection and transportation mode identification, respectively. \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} achieves these superior performances without requiring any training data or fine-tuning the MLLM backbones.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |
| **[OmniCache: A Trajectory-Oriented Global Perspective on Training-Free Cache Reuse for Diffusion Transformer Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16212v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure. In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Preference Trajectory Modeling via Flow Matching for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17618v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation predicts each user's next item based on their historical interaction sequence. Recently, diffusion models have attracted significant attention in this area due to their strong ability to model user interest distributions. They typically generate target items by denoising Gaussian noise conditioned on historical interactions. However, these models face two critical limitations. First, they exhibit high sensitivity to the condition, making it difficult to recover target items from pure Gaussian noise. Second, the inference process is computationally expensive, limiting practical deployment. To address these issues, we propose FlowRec, a simple yet effective sequential recommendation framework which leverages flow matching to explicitly model user preference trajectories from current states to future interests. Flow matching is an emerging generative paradigm, which offers greater flexibility in initial distributions and enables more efficient sampling. Based on this, we construct a personalized behavior-based prior distribution to replace Gaussian noise and learn a vector field to model user preference trajectories. To better align flow matching with the recommendation objective, we further design a single-step alignment loss incorporating both positive and negative samples, improving sampling efficiency and generation quality. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the superiority of FlowRec over the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v5)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified.

However, traditional heuristics for branching often fail to generalize across heterogeneous problem instances, while existing learning-based methods such as imitation learning (IL) suffers from dependence on expert demonstration quality, and reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with limitations in sparse rewards and dynamic state representation challenges. To address these issues, we propose ReviBranch, a novel deep RL framework that constructs revived trajectories by reviving explicit historical correspondences between branching decisions and their corresponding graph states along search-tree paths. During training, ReviBranch enables agents to learn from complete structural evolution and temporal dependencies within the branching process. Additionally, we introduce an importance-weighted reward redistribution mechanism that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense stepwise feedback, addressing the sparse reward challenge. Extensive experiments on different MILP benchmarks demonstrate that ReviBranch outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, reducing B&B nodes by 4.0% and LP iterations by 2.2% on large-scale instances. The results highlight the robustness and generalizability of ReviBranch across heterogeneous MILP problem classes.</p></details> | conference |

Natural language enables users to express these adjustments in an interactive manner. We introduce OVITA, an interpretable, open-vocabulary, language-driven framework designed for adapting robot trajectories in dynamic and novel situations based on human instructions. OVITA leverages multiple pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate user commands into trajectories generated by motion planners or those learned through demonstrations. OVITA employs code as an adaptation policy generated by an LLM, enabling users to adjust individual waypoints, thus providing flexible control. Another LLM, which acts as a code explainer, removes the need for expert users, enabling intuitive interactions. The efficacy and significance of the proposed OVITA framework is demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-world environments with diverse tasks involving spatiotemporal variations on heterogeneous robotic platforms such as a KUKA IIWA robot manipulator, Clearpath Jackal ground robot, and CrazyFlie drone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics and Automation Letters 2025.

Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG) representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF) design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups, and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving high fidelity along the original trajectory.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Rapid Iterative Trajectory Planning Method for Automated Parking through Differential Flatness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17038v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous driving continues to advance, automated parking is becoming increasingly essential. However, significant challenges arise when implementing path velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking. The primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory planning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves maintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory, particularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based rapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above challenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time efficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance framework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned trajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal smoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the proposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path adheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to maintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility of the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time efficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other iteration-based trajectory planning methods. In the real-world experiment, the proposed method was implemented and validated on a ROS-based vehicle, demonstrating the applicability of the RITP method for real vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the journal Robotics and Autonomous Systems</p></details> |

The framework is built upon Large Language Models (LLMs), incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowered by Agentic AI and integrated with a UAV-specific knowledge base. Through the Agentic RAG, the LLM autonomously interprets high-level task requirements and identifies the key components necessary for trajectory optimization, including model inputs and outputs, network architecture, reward functions, and task constraints. To support efficient modeling across different system scales, we introduce the Mamba-Attention Integrated Transformer (MAIT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines the long-range dependency modeling capability of attention mechanisms with the efficient temporal dynamic representation of Mamba. Furthermore, a Trajectory-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) method is proposed to achieve unified policy gradient optimization in both discrete and continuous trajectory spaces for MAIT training. Extensive experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ARMAIT framework.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing planners rely on a fixed, pre-specified horizon during both training and inference. This rigidity often produces length-mismatch (trajectories that are too short or too long) and brittle performance across instances with varying geometric or dynamical difficulty. In this paper, we introduce the Variable Horizon Diffuser (VHD) framework, which treats the horizon as a learned variable rather than a fixed hyperparameter. Given a start-goal pair, we first predict an instance-specific horizon using a learned Length Predictor model, which guides a Diffusion Planner to generate a trajectory of the desired length. Our design maintains compatibility with existing diffusion planners by controlling trajectory length through initial noise shaping and training on randomly cropped sub-trajectories, without requiring architectural changes. Empirically, VHD improves success rates and path efficiency in maze-navigation and robot-arm control benchmarks, showing greater robustness to horizon mismatch and unseen lengths, while keeping training simple and offline-only.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods, however, often struggle to capture the full richness of these dynamics, particularly the co-existence of multi-scale interactions and the diverse behaviors of heterogeneous agents. To address these challenges, this paper introduces HeLoFusion, an efficient and scalable encoder for modeling heterogeneous and multi-scale agent interactions. Instead of relying on global context, HeLoFusion constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each agent, allowing it to effectively model both direct pairwise dependencies and complex group-wise interactions (\textit{e.g.}, platooning vehicles or pedestrian crowds). Furthermore, HeLoFusion tackles the critical challenge of agent heterogeneity through an aggregation-decomposition message-passing scheme and type-specific feature networks, enabling it to learn nuanced, type-dependent interaction patterns. This locality-focused approach enables a principled representation of multi-level social context, yielding powerful and expressive agent embeddings. On the challenging Waymo Open Motion Dataset, HeLoFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting new benchmarks for key metrics including Soft mAP and minADE. Our work demonstrates that a locality-grounded architecture, which explicitly models multi-scale and heterogeneous interactions, is a highly effective strategy for advancing motion forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Radio Map-Enabled 3D Trajectory and Communication Optimization for Low-Altitude Air-Ground Cooperation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06944v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-altitude economy includes the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serving ground robots. This paper investigates the 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory and communication optimization for low-altitude air-ground cooperation systems, where mobile unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) upload data to UAVs. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to maximize the minimal sum-rate of UGVs while ensuring quality of service and navigation constraints. The proposed algorithm integrates a successive convex approximation (SCA)-penalty method for UGV-UAV scheduling, an SCA-based approach for UGV transmit power control, and a novel warm-start particle swarm optimization with cross mutation (WS-PSO-CM). The WS-PSO-CM leverages convex optimization results from a statistical channel model to initialize particle swarm, significantly improving the performance, compared with celebrated PSO-CM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a $45.8$\% higher minimal sum-rate compared to the baseline PSO-CM under the same iterations. This gain can be translated to reducing computational time by $46.7$\% of PSO-CM. Furthermore, our simulation results reveal that UAVs dynamically adjust trajectories to avoid interference by buildings, and maintain proximity to UGVs to mitigate path-loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; 7 figures; accepted by GC-2026-Workshops</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Frame-wise Tracking: A Trajectory-based Paradigm for Efficient Point Cloud Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11453v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation, TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers.

Recently, large-scale pretrained foundation models have been leveraged as shared priors for perception, reasoning, and action, enabling zero-shot VLN without task-specific training. However, existing zero-shot VLN methods depend on costly perception and passive scene understanding, collapsing control to point-level choices. As a result, they are expensive to deploy, misaligned in action semantics, and short-sighted in planning. To address these issues, we present DreamNav that focuses on the following three aspects: (1) for reducing sensory cost, our EgoView Corrector aligns viewpoints and stabilizes egocentric perception; (2) instead of point-level actions, our Trajectory Predictor favors global trajectory-level planning to better align with instruction semantics; and (3) to enable anticipatory and long-horizon planning, we propose an Imagination Predictor to endow the agent with proactive thinking capability. On VLN-CE and real-world tests, DreamNav sets a new zero-shot state-of-the-art (SOTA), outperforming the strongest egocentric baseline with extra information by up to 7.49\% and 18.15\% in terms of SR and SPL metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first zero-shot VLN method to unify trajectory-level planning and active imagination while using only egocentric inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tracailer: An Efficient Trajectory Planner for Tractor-Trailer Robots in Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19832v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tractor-trailer robot consists of a drivable tractor and one or more non-drivable trailers connected via hitches. Compared to typical car-like robots, the addition of trailers provides greater transportation capability. However, this also complicates motion planning due to the robot's complex kinematics, high-dimensional state space, and deformable structure. To efficiently plan safe, time-optimal trajectories that adhere to the kinematic constraints of the robot and address the challenges posed by its unique features, this paper introduces a lightweight, compact, and high-order smooth trajectory representation for tractor-trailer robots. Based on it, we design an efficiently solvable spatial-temporal trajectory optimization problem. To deal with deformable structures, which leads to difficulties in collision avoidance, we fully leverage the collisionfree regions of the environment, directly applying deformations to trajectories in continuous space. This approach not requires constructing safe regions from the environment using convex approximations through collision-free seed points before each optimization, avoiding the loss of the solution space, thus reducing the dependency of the optimization on initial values. Moreover, a multi-terminal fast path search algorithm is proposed to generate the initial values for optimization. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves severalfold improvements in efficiency compared to existing algorithms, while also ensuring lower curvature and trajectory duration. Real-world experiments involving the transportation, loading and unloading of goods in both indoor and outdoor scenarios further validate the effectiveness of our method.

Existing methods struggle with sparse data, incomplete routes, and limited modeling of complex spatial dependencies, often relying on low-level check-in data or ignoring spatial patterns. In this paper, we introduced GCN-TULHOR, a method that transforms raw location data into higher-order mobility flow representations using hexagonal tessellation, reducing data sparsity and capturing richer spatial semantics, and integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Our approach converts both sparse check-in and continuous GPS trajectory data into unified higher-order flow representations, mitigating sparsity while capturing deeper semantic information. The GCN layer explicitly models complex spatial relationships and non-local dependencies without requiring side information such as timestamps or points of interest. Experiments on six real-world datasets show consistent improvements over classical baselines, RNN- and Transformer-based models, and the TULHOR method in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. GCN-TULHOR achieves 1-8% relative gains in accuracy and F1. Sensitivity analysis identifies an optimal setup with a single GCN layer and 512-dimensional embeddings. The integration of GCNs enhances spatial learning and improves generalizability across mobility data. This work highlights the value of combining graph-based spatial learning with sequential modeling, offering a robust and scalable solution for TUL with applications in recommendations, urban planning, and security.</p></details> |  |

The new estimate is $O(N^{-1/2})$, with a constant related to the probability of success of the bound, given by Hoeffding's inequality, similar to other methodologies, such as Philipp et al. Furthermore, we propose a \textit{lifting back} operator to obtain trajectories generated by embedding the initial state and iterating a linear system in a higher dimension. This naturally yields an $O(N^{-1/2})$ error bound for mean trajectories. Finally, we show numerical results including an example of nonlinear system, exhibiting successful approximation with exponential decay faster than $-1/2$, as suggested by the theoretical results.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

To improve prediction accuracy, recent approaches often rely on pre-built high-definition (HD) maps or real-time local map construction modules to incorporate static environmental information. However, pre-built HD maps are limited to specific regions and cannot adapt to transient changes. In addition, local map construction modules, which recognize only predefined elements, may fail to capture critical scene details or introduce errors that degrade prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Bird's-Eye View Trajectory Prediction (BEVTraj), a novel trajectory prediction framework that operates directly in the bird's-eye view (BEV) space utilizing real-time sensor data without relying on any pre-built maps. The BEVTraj leverages deformable attention to efficiently extract relevant context from dense BEV features. Furthermore, we introduce a Sparse Goal Candidate Proposal (SGCP) module, which enables full end-to-end prediction without requiring any post-processing steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the BEVTraj achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art HD map-based models while offering greater flexibility by eliminating the dependency on pre-built maps.

In response, analyses of social media (SM) language have gained prominence due to their high temporal resolution and longitudinal scope. Here, we introduce a method to determine the timing of users' diagnoses and apply it to study language trajectories from 3 years before to 21 years after BD diagnosis - contrasted with uses reporting unipolar depression (UD) and non-affected users (HC). We show that BD diagnosis is accompanied by pervasive linguistic alterations reflecting mood disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, substance abuse, hospitalization, medical comorbidities, unusual thought content, and disorganized thought. We further observe recurring mood-related language changes across two decades after the diagnosis, with a pronounced 12-month periodicity suggestive of seasonal mood episodes. Finally, trend-level evidence suggests an increased periodicity in users estimated to be female. In sum, our findings provide evidence for language alterations in the acute and chronic phase of BD. This validates and extends recent efforts leveraging SM for scalable monitoring of mental health.</p></details> | Pre-print |

Although exploration reduces human effort, it lacks safety guarantees and often results in frequent collisions -- particularly in clearance-limited tasks (e.g., peg-in-hole) -- thereby, necessitating manual environmental resets and imposing additional human burden. This study proposes Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory (SART), a framework that enables policy learning from a single human demonstration, while safely expanding the dataset through autonomous augmentation. SART consists of two stages: (1) human teaching only once, where a single demonstration is provided and precision boundaries -- represented as spheres around key waypoints -- are annotated, followed by one environment reset; (2) robot self-augmentation, where the robot generates diverse, collision-free trajectories within these boundaries and reconnects to the original demonstration. This design improves the data collection efficiency by minimizing human effort while ensuring safety. Extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world manipulation tasks show that SART achieves substantially higher success rates than policies trained solely on human-collected demonstrations.

Existing methods typically rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets. Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification, which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and zero-shot approaches.</p></details> |  |

Although conventional deep learning methods have improved accuracy, they remain hindered by inherent limitations, including lack of interpretability, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated data, and weak generalization in long-tail scenarios. The rise of Large Foundation Models (LFMs) is transforming the research paradigm of trajectory prediction. This survey offers a systematic review of recent advances in LFMs, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for trajectory prediction. By integrating linguistic and scene semantics, LFMs facilitate interpretable contextual reasoning, significantly enhancing prediction safety and generalization in complex environments. The article highlights three core methodologies: trajectory-language mapping, multimodal fusion, and constraint-based reasoning. It covers prediction tasks for both vehicles and pedestrians, evaluation metrics, and dataset analyses. Key challenges such as computational latency, data scarcity, and real-world robustness are discussed, along with future research directions including low-latency inference, causality-aware modeling, and motion foundation models.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

Unlike existing methods that rely solely on instantaneous observations or static assumptions, we present an approach that predicts future parking spot occupancy by explicitly distinguishing between initially vacant and occupied spots, and by leveraging the predicted motion of dynamic agents. We introduce a probabilistic spot occupancy estimator that incorporates partial and noisy observations within a limited Field-of-View (FoV) model and accounts for the evolving uncertainty of unobserved regions. Coupled with this, we design a strategy planner that adaptively balances goal-directed parking maneuvers with exploratory navigation based on information gain, and intelligently incorporates wait-and-go behaviors at promising spots. Through randomized simulations emulating large parking lots, we demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parking efficiency, safety margins, and trajectory smoothness compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[MGTraj: Multi-Granularity Goal-Guided Human Trajectory Prediction with Recursive Refinement Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09200v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities: coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.</p></details> |  |

Experiments in high-fidelity simulators and in the real world demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach in various scenarios. Even in complex environments with intricate rules, we efficiently and reliably repair rule-violating trajectories, enabling automated vehicles to swiftly resume legally safe operation in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE.

Existing methods often face high computational cost or rely on external safety critics. To address this, we propose an Interaction-Enriched Unified Potential Field (IUPF) framework that fuses style-dependent benefit and risk fields through a physics-inspired variational model, grounded in mean field game theory. The approach captures conservative, aggressive, and cooperative behaviors without additional safety modules, and employs stochastic differential equations to guarantee Nash equilibrium with exponential convergence. Simulations on lane changing and overtaking scenarios show that IUPF ensures safe distances, generates smooth and efficient trajectories, and outperforms traditional optimization and game-theoretic baselines in both adaptability and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

The gradient constraint is enforced by thresholding the $\ell_2$-norm of the next gradient vector. The constraints form a quadratic equation. To ensure the existence of the solution, a novel Discrete-Time Forward and Backward Sweep (DTFBS) strategy is proposed. To ensure the existence of the trajectory derivatives, the trajectory function is reparameterized as a piecewise cubic polynomial function with $C^2$ continuity. To ensure trajectory fidelity, the output gradient waveform is reparameterized by the finite difference of the trajectory samples. Simulation experiments across seven commonly adopted non-Cartesian trajectories were conducted to validate generality, time-optimality, real-time capability, slew-rate accuracy, and improvements over prior work. Imaging feasibility of the designed time-optimal gradient waveform was validated in phantom and in vivo experiments. \textbf{Results: }The proposed method achieves a $>89\%$ reduction in computation time and simultaneously reduces slew-rate overshoot by $>98\%$ compared to the prior method across all involved trajectories. The computation time of the proposed method is shorter than the gradient duration for all tested cases, validating the real-time capability of the proposed method. \textbf{Conclusions: }The proposed method enables real-time and hardware-compliant gradient waveform design, achieving significant reductions in computation time and slew-rate overshoot compared to the previous method. \textbf{Significance: }This is the first method achieving real-time gradient waveform design for arbitrary $k$-space trajectories.</p></details> |  |

While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Generalized Hamiltonian Dynamics with Stability from Noisy Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07280v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative, and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics, appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction accuracy with bounded uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often assume fixed graph structures and require retraining when network conditions change, making them unsuitable for deployment on constrained hardware. We present TrajAware, an RL-based framework designed for edge AI deployment in VANETs. TrajAware integrates three components: (i) action space pruning, which reduces redundant neighbour options while preserving two-hop reachability, alleviating the curse of dimensionality; (ii) graph cross-attention, which maps pruned neighbours to the global graph context, producing features that generalise across diverse network sizes; and (iii) trajectory-aware prediction, which uses historical routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial observations. We evaluate TrajAware in the open-source SUMO simulator using real-world city maps with a leave-one-city-out setup. Results show that TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Resident fitness computation in linear time and other algorithmic aspects of interacting trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11561v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The notion of a system of interacting trajectories was recently introduced by Hermann, Gonz\'alez Casanova, Soares dos Santos, T\'obi\'as and Wakolbinger. Such a system of $[0,1]$-valued piecewise linear trajectories arises as a scaling limit of the system of logarithmic subpopulation sizes in a population-genetic model (more precisely, a Moran model) with mutation and selection. By definition, the resident fitness is initially 0 and afterwards it increases by the ultimate slope of each trajectory that reaches height 1. We show that although the interaction of $n$ trajectories may yield $\Omega(n^2)$ slope changes in total, the resident fitness function can be computed algorithmically in $O(n)$ time. Our algorithm uses the so-called continued lines representation of the system of interacting trajectories. In the special case of Poissonian interacting trajectories where the birth times of the trajectories form a Poisson process and the initial slopes are random and i.i.d., we provide a linear bound on the expected total number of slope changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v5)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

| **[Statistical description and dimension reduction of categorical trajectories with multivariate functional principal components](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09986v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many examples in which the statistical units of interest are samples of a continuous time categorical random process, that is to say a continuous time stochastic process taking values in a finite state space. Getting simple representations that allow comparisons of a set of trajectories is of major interest for statisticians. Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical description of the categorical trajectories into a multivariate functional principal components analysis. The (multivariate) covariance operator has nice interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities and the multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, it is simple to build consistent estimators of the covariance kernel and perform multivariate functional principal components analysis. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories are not supposed to be continuous and can be observed exhaustively. The approach is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments. We also show how it can be easily extended to analyze experiments, such as temporal check-all-that-apply, in which two states or more can be observed at the same time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe and Economical UAV Trajectory Planning in Low-Altitude Airspace: A Hybrid DRL-LLM Approach with Compliance Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08532v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of the low-altitude economy has driven the widespread adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This growing deployment presents new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments. However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM) reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate, collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the low-altitude economy networking.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior learning-based methods, ZLATTE leverages Vision-Language Models to register objects as geometric primitives and employs a Large Language Model to translate natural language instructions into explicit geometric and kinematic constraints. These constraints are integrated into a potential field optimization to adapt initial trajectories while preserving feasibility and safety. A multi-agent strategy further enhances robustness under complex or conflicting commands. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that ZLATTE achieves smoother, safer, and more interpretable trajectory modifications compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Scaling of Diffusion Models via Noise Trajectory Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03164v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The iterative and stochastic nature of diffusion models enables test-time scaling, whereby spending additional compute during denoising generates higher-fidelity samples. Increasing the number of denoising steps is the primary scaling axis, but this yields quickly diminishing returns. Instead optimizing the noise trajectory--the sequence of injected noise vectors--is promising, as the specific noise realizations critically affect sample quality; but this is challenging due to a high-dimensional search space, complex noise-outcome interactions, and costly trajectory evaluations. We address this by first casting diffusion as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a terminal reward, showing tree-search methods such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to be meaningful but impractical. To balance performance and efficiency, we then resort to a relaxation of MDP, where we view denoising as a sequence of independent contextual bandits. This allows us to introduce an $\epsilon$-greedy search algorithm that globally explores at extreme timesteps and locally exploits during the intermediate steps where de-mixing occurs. Experiments on EDM and Stable Diffusion reveal state-of-the-art scores for class-conditioned/text-to-image generation, exceeding baselines by up to $164\%$ and matching/exceeding MCTS performance. To our knowledge, this is the first practical method for test-time noise trajectory optimization of arbitrary (non-differentiable) rewards.</p></details> |  |
| **[MENSA: A Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis with Trajectory-based Likelihood Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06525v4)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing time-to-event methods focus on either single-event or competing-risk settings, leaving multi-event scenarios relatively underexplored. In many real-world applications, the same patient may experience multiple events that are non-exclusive, and sometimes semi-competing. A common workaround is to train separate single-event models, but this approach fails to exploit dependencies and shared structure across events. To address these limitations, we propose MENSA (Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis), a deep learning model that jointly models flexible time-to-event distributions for multiple events, whether competing or co-occurring. In addition, we introduce a novel trajectory-based likelihood that captures the temporal ordering between events. Across five benchmark datasets, MENSA consistently improves prediction performance over many state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Efficient Virtuoso: A Latent Diffusion Transformer Model for Goal-Conditioned Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03658v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems. While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity, computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present the Efficient Virtuoso, a conditional latent diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, achieving a minimum Average Displacement Error (minADE) of 0.25. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Effective Trajectory Planning and an Optimized Path Planning for a 6-Degree-of-Freedom Robot Manipulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00828v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An effective method for optimizing path planning for a specific model of a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator is presented as part of the motion planning of the manipulator using computer algebra. We assume that we are given a path in the form of a set of line segments that the end-effector should follow. We also assume that we have a method to solve the inverse kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector. Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by reducing the problem to a shortest-path problem of the graph and applying Dijkstra's algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by experiments.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Learning to Coordinate: Distributed Meta-Trajectory Optimization Via Differentiable ADMM-DDP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01630v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Acceleration Preconditioners for Parametric Radiative Transfer Equations based on Trajectory-Aware Reduced Order Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05001v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The parametric radiative transfer equation (RTE) arises in multi-query applications, such as design optimization, inverse problems, and uncertainty quantification, which require solving the RTE multiple times for various parameters. Classical synthetic acceleration (SA) preconditioners are designed based on low-order approximations of a kinetic correction equation, e.g., its diffusion limit in diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA). Despite their widespread success, these methods rely on empirical physical assumptions and do not leverage low-rank structures across parameters of the parametric problem. To address these limitations, our previous work introduced a reduced-order model (ROM) enhanced preconditioner called ROMSAD, which exploits low-rank structures across parameters and the original kinetic description of the correction equation. While ROMSAD improves overall efficiency compared with DSA, its efficiency reduces after the first iteration, because the construction of the underlying ROM ignores the preconditioner-dependence of the residual trajectory, leading to a mismatch between the offline and online residual trajectories. To overcome this issue, we introduce a trajectory-aware framework that iteratively constructs ROMs to eliminate the mismatch between offline and online residual trajectories. Numerical tests demonstrate superior efficiency over DSA, and substantial gains in both efficiency and robustness over ROMSAD. For a parametric lattice problem, trajectory-aware ROM preconditioners achieve rapid convergence within only $2$-$3$ iterations online.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |

While human-motion-centric approaches excel in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods. Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in global human motion reconstruction.

STO maintains the maneuver strategy of the high-level global planner while allowing curvature discontinuities at switching points to improve maneuver efficiency. To ensure safety, a convex corridor is constructed via GJK-accelerated ellipse shrinking and expansion, serving as safety constraints in each iteration. Numerical simulations in perpendicular and reverse-angled parking scenarios demonstrate that STO enhances maneuver efficiency while ensuring safety. Moreover, computational performance confirms its practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

However, traditional IL methods are limited by their reliance on high-quality, often scarce, expert data, and suffer from covariate shift. To address these challenges, recent advances in offline IL have incorporated suboptimal, unlabeled datasets into the training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance policy learning from mixed-quality offline datasets by leveraging task-relevant trajectory fragments and rich environmental dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a state-based search framework that stitches state-action pairs from imperfect demonstrations, generating more diverse and informative training trajectories. Experimental results on standard IL benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks showcase that our proposed method significantly improves both generalization and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can the Waymo Open Motion Dataset Support Realistic Behavioral Modeling? A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03515v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations. Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably, WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving. Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without proper validation against independently collected data.</p></details> |  |

For control purposes, the model is structured as a cascade system, where a rotational subsystem drives a translational one. The rotational subsystem is linear, while the translational subsystem follows a linear-plus-perturbation form, thereby reducing the complexity of control design. A control strategy requiring only simple operations, no memory, and no iterative search loops is presented to illustrate the main features of the GA model. By employing GA to model both translations and rotations, a singularity-free and geometrically intuitive representation can be achieved through the use of the geometric product. Closed-loop stability is rigorously established using input-to-state stability methods. Numerical simulations of a quad tilt-rotorcraft performing trajectory tracking in a windy environment validate the controller's stability and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE TAES for possible publication</p></details> |

To address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars. Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion, and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset, KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising, data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

Still, existing data-driven models are constrained mainly to single-vessel forecasting, overlooking vessel interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to strengthen maritime safety and decision support.</p></details> |  |

The outer-loop controller generates an acceleration reference, which is then converted into attitude and angular velocity references, later tracked by a nonlinear inner-loop controller. Numerical simulations validate the approach, demonstrating enhanced performance in precise and fast tracking by imposing less conservative constraints than existing approaches, while still guaranteeing stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, submitted to 2025 IEEE 64th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)</p></details> |
| **[Relative Trajectory Balance is equivalent to Trust-PCL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01632v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in generative modeling has highlighted the importance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning, with KL-regularized methods in particular proving to be highly effective for both autoregressive and diffusion models. Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB) objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an illustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods achieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was previously reported.</p></details> |  |

The main obstacle is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for city level, large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial difficulties for road level, small-scale aggregation. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales for static and interactive maps.</p></details> |  |

While general-purpose deep research agents have shown impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored for medical contexts. We present a medical deep research agent that addresses these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool interactions. Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Metamorphic Testing of Multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01294v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Predicting human trajectories is crucial for the safety and reliability of autonomous systems, such as automated vehicles and mobile robots. However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g., trajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs (multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary difficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future trajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This research presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic methodology for testing multimodal HTP systems. We address the oracle problem through metamorphic relations (MRs) adapted for the complexities and stochastic nature of HTP. Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both historical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an environmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric transformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and map inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2) Map-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing obstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions. We propose probabilistic violation criteria based on distance metrics between probability distributions, such as the Wasserstein or Hellinger distance. Conclusion: This study introduces tool, a MT framework for the oracle-less testing of multimodal, stochastic HTP systems. It allows for assessment of model robustness against input transformations and contextual changes without reliance on ground-truth trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Infor...</summary><p>Information and Software Technology</p></details> |
| **[Toward a Holistic Multi-Criteria Trajectory Evaluation Framework for Autonomous Driving in Mixed Traffic Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01291v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a unified framework for the evaluation and optimization of autonomous vehicle trajectories, integrating formal safety, comfort, and efficiency criteria. An innovative geometric indicator, based on the analysis of safety zones using adaptive ellipses, is used to accurately quantify collision risks. Our method applies the Shoelace formula to compute the intersection area in the case of misaligned and time-varying configurations. Comfort is modeled using indicators centered on longitudinal and lateral jerk, while efficiency is assessed by overall travel time. These criteria are aggregated into a comprehensive objective function solved using a PSO based algorithm. The approach was successfully validated under real traffic conditions via experiments conducted in an urban intersection involving an autonomous vehicle interacting with a human-operated vehicle, and in simulation using data recorded from human driving in real traffic.</p></details> |  |
| **[MVTrajecter: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking with Trajectory Motion Cost and Trajectory Appearance Cost](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01157v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association. MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition, MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

While existing trajectory planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i) a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives, providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.</p></details> |  |

Although data acquisition using drones is efficient, existing datasets still have limitations in scene representativeness, information richness, and data fidelity. This study introduces FLUID, comprising a fine-grained trajectory dataset that captures dense conflicts at typical urban signalized intersections, and a lightweight, full-pipeline framework for drone-based trajectory processing. FLUID covers three distinct intersection types, with approximately 5 hours of recording time and featuring over 20,000 TPs across 8 categories. Notably, the dataset averages two vehicle conflicts per minute, involving roughly 25% of all motor vehicles. FLUID provides comprehensive data, including trajectories, traffic signals, maps, and raw videos. Comparison with the DataFromSky platform and ground-truth measurements validates its high spatio-temporal accuracy. Through a detailed classification of motor vehicle conflicts and violations, FLUID reveals a diversity of interactive behaviors, demonstrating its value for human preference mining, traffic behavior modeling, and autonomous driving research.</p></details> | 26 pages, 14 figures |

Using the two-scale Lorenz '96 system as a case study, we develop and train both additive and multiplicative stochastic parametrizations to generate ensemble predictions. Results indicate that CRPS-based trajectory learning produces parametrizations that are both accurate and sharp. The resulting parametrizations are straightforward to calibrate and outperform derivative-fitting-based parametrizations in short-term forecasts.

| **[Temporal Flow Matching for Learning Spatio-Temporal Trajectories in 4D Longitudinal Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21580v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions. While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e. predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports $3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.</p></details> |  |

Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory. This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate superior visual quality compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8page...</summary><p>8pages; 7figures; 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Dynamics-Compliant Trajectory Diffusion for Super-Nominal Payload Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21375v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nominal payload ratings for articulated robots are typically derived from worst-case configurations, resulting in uniform payload constraints across the entire workspace. This conservative approach severely underutilizes the robot's inherent capabilities -- our analysis demonstrates that manipulators can safely handle payloads well above nominal capacity across broad regions of their workspace while staying within joint angle, velocity, acceleration, and torque limits. To address this gap between assumed and actual capability, we propose a novel trajectory generation approach using denoising diffusion models that explicitly incorporates payload constraints into the planning process. Unlike traditional sampling-based methods that rely on inefficient trial-and-error, optimization-based methods that are prohibitively slow, or kinodynamic planners that struggle with problem dimensionality, our approach generates dynamically feasible joint-space trajectories in constant time that can be directly executed on physical hardware without post-processing. Experimental validation on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that up to 67.6% of the workspace remains accessible even with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal capacity. This expanded operational envelope highlights the importance of a more nuanced consideration of payload dynamics in motion planning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 Conference on Robot Learning [CoRL]</p></details> |
| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manifold Trajectories in Next-Token Prediction: From Replicator Dynamics to Softmax Equilibrium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21186v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comparative Study of Spline-Based Trajectory Reconstruction Methods Across Varying Automatic Vehicle Location Data Densities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00119v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic vehicle location (AVL) data offers insights into transit dynamics, but its effectiveness is often hampered by inconsistent update frequencies, necessitating trajectory reconstruction. This research evaluates 13 trajectory reconstruction methods, including several novel approaches, using high-resolution AVL data from Austin, Texas. We examine the interplay of four critical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on reconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of these methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the trade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework combines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity with practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning velocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed variability). In addition, we provide insight into the relative value of each method in calculating realistic metrics for infrastructure evaluations. Our findings indicate that velocity-aware methods consistently outperform position-only approaches. Interestingly, we discovered that smoothing-based methods can degrade overall performance in complex, congested urban environments, although enforcing monotonicity remains critical. The velocity constrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME) yields optimal results, offering a balance between high accuracy and computational efficiency. Its minimal overhead makes it suitable for both historical analysis and real-time applications, providing significant predictive power when combined with dense datasets. These findings offer practical guidance for researchers and practitioners implementing trajectory reconstruction systems and emphasize the importance of investing in higher-frequency AVL data collection for improved analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeMat-Traj: A Scalable and Unified Dataset of Materials Trajectories for Atomistic Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20875v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs. LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued evolution of large-scale materials datasets.

However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher.

The investigation of these dynamics can provide a better understanding of diffusing objects and their surrounding media, but a quantitative characterization from individual trajectories is often challenging. Efforts devoted to improving anomalous diffusion detection using classical statistics and machine learning have produced several new methods. Recently, the anomalous diffusion challenge (AnDi, www.andi-challenge.org) was launched to objectively assess these approaches on a common dataset, focusing on three aspects of anomalous diffusion: the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent; the classification of the diffusion model; and the segmentation of trajectories. In this article, I describe a simple approach to tackle the tasks of the AnDi challenge by combining extreme learning machine and feature engineering (AnDi-ELM). The method reaches satisfactory performance while offering a straightforward implementation and fast training time with limited computing resources, making it a suitable tool for fast preliminary screening of anomalous diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Ego-centric Predictive Model Conditioned on Hand Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19852v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In egocentric scenarios, anticipating both the next action and its visual outcome is essential for understanding human-object interactions and for enabling robotic planning. However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly modeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action prediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual scene, while video prediction models generate future frames without conditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or contextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified two-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in egocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we perform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual observations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce causal cross-attention to fuse multi-modal cues, leveraging inferred action signals to guide an image-based Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for frame-by-frame future video generation. Our approach is the first unified model designed to handle both egocentric human activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit predictions of both upcoming actions and their visual consequences. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both action prediction and future video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: github.com/showlab/Ego-PM</p></details> |

To provide an optimized solution, we propose a cooperative trajectory optimization and task allocation framework leveraging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). This study integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for efficient task allocation among multiple UAVs and UGVs, and employs an informed-RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) algorithm for collision-free trajectory generation. Further optimization of task sequencing and path efficiency is conducted using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Simulation experiments conducted in a realistic post-disaster environment demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves the overall efficiency of medical rescue operations compared to traditional strategies. Specifically, our method reduces the total mission completion time to 26.7 minutes for a 15-task scenario, outperforming K-Means clustering and random allocation by over 73%. Furthermore, the framework achieves a substantial 15.1% reduction in total traveled distance after CMA-ES optimization. The cooperative utilization of UAVs and UGVs effectively balances their complementary advantages, highlighting the system's scalability and practicality for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Trust Region Sequential Convex Optimization for Multi-Drone Thermal Screening Trajectory Planning in Urban Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06012v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is essential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas.

| **[Coresets from Trajectories: Selecting Data via Correlation of Loss Differences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20230v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k, CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with <1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints, incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled, efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion: Real-Time Trajectory Planning with Just-Enough Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12166v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots equipped with rich sensor suites can localize reliably in partially-observable environments, but powering every sensor continuously is wasteful and often infeasible. Belief-space planners address this by propagating pose-belief covariance through analytic models and switching sensors heuristically--a brittle, runtime-expensive approach. Data-driven approaches--including diffusion models--learn multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, but presuppose an accurate, always-on state estimate. We address the largely open problem: for a given task in a mapped environment, which \textit{minimal sensor subset} must be active at each location to maintain state uncertainty \textit{just low enough} to complete the task? Our key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error. Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion (B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for localisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this single proxy suffices for a soft-actor-critic to choose sensors online, optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth. We deploy B-COD in real-time marine trials on an unmanned surface vehicle and show that it reduces sensing energy consumption while matching the goal-reach performance of an always-on baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025 (Conference on Robot Learning)</p></details> |

The task of predicting pedestrian crossing intention involves determining whether pedestrians in the scene are likely to cross the road or not. In this work, we propose TrajFusionNet, a novel transformer-based model that combines future pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed predictions as priors for predicting crossing intention. TrajFusionNet comprises two branches: a Sequence Attention Module (SAM) and a Visual Attention Module (VAM). The SAM branch learns from a sequential representation of the observed and predicted pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed. Complementarily, the VAM branch enables learning from a visual representation of the predicted pedestrian trajectory by overlaying predicted pedestrian bounding boxes onto scene images. By utilizing a small number of lightweight modalities, TrajFusionNet achieves the lowest total inference time (including model runtime and data preprocessing) among current state-of-the-art approaches. In terms of performance, it achieves state-of-the-art results across the three most commonly used datasets for pedestrian crossing intention prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles for possible publication</p></details> |

In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold.

This paper introduces the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline (TAP), a scalable and automated method for extracting SDL labels from large trajectory datasets. TAP applies a rules-based cross-entropy optimization approach to learn parameters directly from data, enhancing generalization across diverse driving contexts. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), TAP achieves 30% greater precision than Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 24% over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in identifying behaviorally similar trajectories. Additionally, TAP enables automated detection of unique driving behaviors, streamlining safety evaluation processes for AV testing. This work provides a foundation for scalable scenario-based AV behavior analysis, with potential extensions for integrating multi-agent contexts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Medical doctors guide these conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including annotation guidelines, publicly available at https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |

By segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process. To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change, motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single, single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200 frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space design validation in crowd dynamics research.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as 3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics, STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Dynamic Trajectory Optimization and Power Control for Hierarchical UAV Swarms in 6G Aerial Access Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18702v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can serve as aerial base stations (BSs) to extend the ubiquitous connectivity for ground users (GUs) in the sixth-generation (6G) era. However, it is challenging to cooperatively deploy multiple UAV swarms in large-scale remote areas. Hence, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical UAV swarms structure for 6G aerial access networks, where the head UAVs serve as aerial BSs, and tail UAVs (T-UAVs) are responsible for relay. In detail, we jointly optimize the dynamic deployment and trajectory of UAV swarms, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) to concurrently minimize the energy consumption of UAV swarms and GUs, as well as the delay of GUs. However, the proposed MOP is a mixed integer nonlinear programming and NP-hard to solve. Therefore, we develop a K-means and Voronoi diagram based area division method, and construct Fermat points to establish connections between GUs and T-UAVs. Then, an improved non-dominated sorting whale optimization algorithm is proposed to seek Pareto optimal solutions for the transformed MOP. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the performance of proposed algorithms by comparing with baseline mechanisms, resulting in a 50% complexity reduction.</p></details> |  |

Our framework features a unified trajectory representation that encapsulates the kinematic models of both $SO(3)\times\mathbb{R}^3$ and $SE(3)$ pose representations. This encapsulation strategy allows users to use the same implementation of measurement-based factors for either choice of pose representation, which facilitates experimentation and comparison to achieve the best model for the ME task. In addition, unique to our framework, we derive the kinematic models with the closed-form temporal derivatives of the local variable of $SO(3)$ and $SE(3)$, which so far has only been approximated based on the Taylor expansion in the literature. Our experiments show that these kinematic models can improve the estimation accuracy in high-speed scenarios. All analytical Jacobians of the interpolated states with respect to the support states of the trajectory representation, as well as the motion prior factors, are also provided for accelerated Gauss-Newton (GN) optimization. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the framework in various motion estimation tasks such as localization, calibration, and odometry, facilitating fast prototyping for ME researchers. We release the source code for the benefit of the community.

Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by 32.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website is at: https://denghaoyuan123.github.io/SafeBimanip/</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Output Steps: FlexiSteps Network for Dynamic Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17797v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is vital for autonomous driving, robotics, and intelligent decision-making systems, yet traditional models typically rely on fixed-length output predictions, limiting their adaptability to dynamic real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the FlexiSteps Network (FSN), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts prediction output time steps based on varying contextual conditions. Inspired by recent advancements addressing observation length discrepancies and dynamic feature extraction, FSN incorporates an pre-trained Adaptive Prediction Module (APM) to evaluate and adjust the output steps dynamically, ensuring optimal prediction accuracy and efficiency. To guarantee the plug-and-play of our FSN, we also design a Dynamic Decoder(DD). Additionally, to balance the prediction time steps and prediction accuracy, we design a scoring mechanism, which not only introduces the Fr\'echet distance to evaluate the geometric similarity between the predicted trajectories and the ground truth trajectories but the length of predicted steps is also considered. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including Argoverse and INTERACTION demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed FSN framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traj-MLLM: Can Multimodal Large Language Models Reform Trajectory Data Mining?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00053v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building a general model capable of analyzing human trajectories across different geographic regions and different tasks becomes an emergent yet important problem for various applications. However, existing works suffer from the generalization problem, \ie, they are either restricted to train for specific regions or only suitable for a few tasks. Given the recent advances of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we raise the question: can MLLMs reform current trajectory data mining and solve the problem? Nevertheless, due to the modality gap of trajectory, how to generate task-independent multimodal trajectory representations and how to adapt flexibly to different tasks remain the foundational challenges. In this paper, we propose \texttt{Traj-MLLM}}, which is the first general framework using MLLMs for trajectory data mining. By integrating multiview contexts, \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} transforms raw trajectories into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving key spatial-temporal characteristics, and directly utilizes the reasoning ability of MLLMs for trajectory analysis. Additionally, a prompt optimization method is proposed to finalize data-invariant prompts for task adaptation. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets show that \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $48.05\%$, $15.52\%$, $51.52\%$, $1.83\%$ on travel time estimation, mobility prediction, anomaly detection and transportation mode identification, respectively. \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} achieves these superior performances without requiring any training data or fine-tuning the MLLM backbones.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |
| **[OmniCache: A Trajectory-Oriented Global Perspective on Training-Free Cache Reuse for Diffusion Transformer Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16212v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure. In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Preference Trajectory Modeling via Flow Matching for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17618v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation predicts each user's next item based on their historical interaction sequence. Recently, diffusion models have attracted significant attention in this area due to their strong ability to model user interest distributions. They typically generate target items by denoising Gaussian noise conditioned on historical interactions. However, these models face two critical limitations. First, they exhibit high sensitivity to the condition, making it difficult to recover target items from pure Gaussian noise. Second, the inference process is computationally expensive, limiting practical deployment. To address these issues, we propose FlowRec, a simple yet effective sequential recommendation framework which leverages flow matching to explicitly model user preference trajectories from current states to future interests. Flow matching is an emerging generative paradigm, which offers greater flexibility in initial distributions and enables more efficient sampling. Based on this, we construct a personalized behavior-based prior distribution to replace Gaussian noise and learn a vector field to model user preference trajectories. To better align flow matching with the recommendation objective, we further design a single-step alignment loss incorporating both positive and negative samples, improving sampling efficiency and generation quality. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the superiority of FlowRec over the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v5)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/JARVIS-Xs/SE-Agent.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional heuristics for branching often fail to generalize across heterogeneous problem instances, while existing learning-based methods such as imitation learning (IL) suffers from dependence on expert demonstration quality, and reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with limitations in sparse rewards and dynamic state representation challenges. To address these issues, we propose ReviBranch, a novel deep RL framework that constructs revived trajectories by reviving explicit historical correspondences between branching decisions and their corresponding graph states along search-tree paths. During training, ReviBranch enables agents to learn from complete structural evolution and temporal dependencies within the branching process. Additionally, we introduce an importance-weighted reward redistribution mechanism that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense stepwise feedback, addressing the sparse reward challenge. Extensive experiments on different MILP benchmarks demonstrate that ReviBranch outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, reducing B&B nodes by 4.0% and LP iterations by 2.2% on large-scale instances. The results highlight the robustness and generalizability of ReviBranch across heterogeneous MILP problem classes.</p></details> | conference |

Natural language enables users to express these adjustments in an interactive manner. We introduce OVITA, an interpretable, open-vocabulary, language-driven framework designed for adapting robot trajectories in dynamic and novel situations based on human instructions. OVITA leverages multiple pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate user commands into trajectories generated by motion planners or those learned through demonstrations. OVITA employs code as an adaptation policy generated by an LLM, enabling users to adjust individual waypoints, thus providing flexible control. Another LLM, which acts as a code explainer, removes the need for expert users, enabling intuitive interactions.

Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG) representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF) design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups, and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving high fidelity along the original trajectory.</p></details> |  |

However, significant challenges arise when implementing path velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking. The primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory planning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves maintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory, particularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based rapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above challenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time efficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance framework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned trajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal smoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the proposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path adheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to maintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility of the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time efficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other iteration-based trajectory planning methods. In the real-world experiment, the proposed method was implemented and validated on a ROS-based vehicle, demonstrating the applicability of the RITP method for real vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the journal Robotics and Autonomous Systems</p></details> |

The framework is built upon Large Language Models (LLMs), incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowered by Agentic AI and integrated with a UAV-specific knowledge base. Through the Agentic RAG, the LLM autonomously interprets high-level task requirements and identifies the key components necessary for trajectory optimization, including model inputs and outputs, network architecture, reward functions, and task constraints. To support efficient modeling across different system scales, we introduce the Mamba-Attention Integrated Transformer (MAIT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines the long-range dependency modeling capability of attention mechanisms with the efficient temporal dynamic representation of Mamba. Furthermore, a Trajectory-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) method is proposed to achieve unified policy gradient optimization in both discrete and continuous trajectory spaces for MAIT training. Extensive experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ARMAIT framework.</p></details> |  |

A cost effective paradigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches often cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful ways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a text retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called RAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition LLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting and introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output (IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References (IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation tasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy incorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens from the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing interactions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and remain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL) methods. Our method presents a scalable strategy for building robust, human-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks.</p></details> |  |

These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures, EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

To evaluate the robustness and efficiency of this approach, we compare LoRA with traditional full fine-tuning and inference-only (no fine-tuning) methods. Cropped images of two sizes (50 mm3 and 75 mm3), centered at the treatment isocenter, in addition to different adaptation techniques for adapting the 2D LVMs for 3D data were used to determine the sensitivity of the models to spatial context.

Traditional cloud-based MoE encounters challenges such as prolonged response latency, high bandwidth consumption, and data privacy leakage. To address these issues, researchers have proposed to deploy MoE over distributed edge networks. However, a key concern of distributed MoE frameworks is the lack of trust in data interactions among distributed experts without the surveillance of any trusted authority, and thereby prone to potential attacks such as data manipulation. In response to the security issues of traditional distributed MoE, we propose a blockchain-aided trustworthy MoE (B-MoE) framework that consists of three layers: the edge layer, the blockchain layer, and the storage layer. In this framework, the edge layer employs the activated experts downloaded from the storage layer to process the learning tasks, while the blockchain layer functions as a decentralized trustworthy network to trace, verify, and record the computational results of the experts from the edge layer. The experimental results demonstrate that B-MoE is more robust to data manipulation attacks than traditional distributed MoE during both the training and inference processes.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, LLMs are increasingly offered as cloud-based services, a paradigm that introduces critical limitations: providers struggle to support personalized customization at scale, while users face privacy risks when exposing sensitive data. To address this dual challenge, we propose Customized Black-box Prompt Tuning (CBP-Tuning), a novel framework that facilitates efficient local customization while preserving bidirectional privacy. Specifically, we design a two-stage framework: (1) a prompt generator trained on the server-side to capture domain-specific and task-agnostic capabilities, and (2) user-side gradient-free optimization that tailors soft prompts for individual tasks. This approach eliminates the need for users to access model weights or upload private data, requiring only a single customized vector per task while achieving effective adaptation. Furthermore, the evaluation of CBP-Tuning in the commonsense reasoning, medical and financial domain settings demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines, showcasing its advantages in task-agnostic processing and privacy preservation.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional DL algorithms face challenges such as redundant feature segments, and constraints from restricted model sizes. To address these issues, we propose a framework that integrates feature preprocessing with large language models (LLMs). Our preprocessing module tokenizes radar sequence features, applies a patch selection algorithm to filter out uninformative segments, and projects the selected patches into embeddings compatible with the feature space of pre-trained LLMs. Leveraging these refined embeddings, we incorporate a pre-trained LLM, fine-tuning only the normalization layers to reduce training burdens while enhancing performance.

The dataset contains 119 tokens covering five entity types (PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, DATE, TIME). We evaluated each system's output against the manually annotated gold standard dataset using F1-score. The results show that LLMs generally outperform conventional tools in recognizing context-sensitive entities like person names, with Gemini achieving the highest average F1-score. However, traditional systems like Stanza demonstrate greater consistency in structured tags such as LOCATION and DATE. We also observed variability among LLMs, particularly in handling temporal expressions and multi-word organizations. Our findings highlight that while LLMs offer improved contextual understanding, traditional tools remain competitive in specific tasks, informing model selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables.

| **[RadarLLM: Adapting Pretrained Large Language Models for Marine Radar Target Detection with Preference-aware Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12089v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their capacities to capture universal knowledge, making them promising general-purpose optimization solvers for wireless signal processing. Motivated by these findings, we take the first step towards fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs for the effective analysis of radar signal features in marine target detection tasks. Nevertheless, directly fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on marine target detection tasks tends to suffer from pronounced overfitting, particularly in challenging low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) scenarios. This overfitting primarily stems from the model's tendency to memorize spurious or noisy feature patterns rather than learning discriminative structures that generalize well to unseen data. To address this challenge, we introduce RadarLLM, a novel fine-tuning framework that utilizes an effective preference-aware loss. Unlike conventional training strategies that uniformly optimize all feature tokens, this loss function selectively optimizes different feature patches based on their online evaluated learning values, thus guiding the model to focus on the most generalizable patterns during optimization. We theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the evaluated learning values by transforming the problem as selecting useful feature tokens. Extensive experiments on real-world marine radar datasets show that 1) the proposed loss function is much better than the original one, with particularly significant gains in challenging low SCR scenarios and 2) RadarLLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse detection scenarios, with particularly notable gains under limited training data conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Framework for Large-Scale Inference of Classification: Error Rate Control and Optimality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07321v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification is a fundamental task in supervised learning, while achieving valid misclassification rate control remains challenging due to possibly the limited predictive capability of the classifiers or the intrinsic complexity of the classification task. In this article, we address large-scale multi-class classification problems with general error rate guarantees to enhance algorithmic trustworthiness. To this end, we first introduce a notion of group-wise classification, which unifies the common class-wise and overall classifications as special cases. We then develop a unified inference framework for the general group-wise classification that consists of three steps: Pre-classification, Selective $p$-value construction, and large-scale Post-classification decisions (PSP). Theoretically, PSP is distribution-free and provides valid finite-sample guarantees for controlling general group-wise false decision rates at target levels. To show the power of PSP, we demonstrate that the step of post-classification decisions never degrades the power of pre-classification, provided that pre-classification has been sufficiently powerful to meet the target error levels. We further establish general power optimality theories for PSP from both non-asymptotic and asymptotic perspectives. Numerical results in both simulations and real data analysis validate the performance of the proposed PSP approach. In addition, we introduce an ePSP algorithm that integrates the idea of PSP with selective $e$-values. Finally, extensions of PSP are shown to demonstrate its feasibility and power in broader applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Safe Unimodal Inputs Collide: Optimizing Reasoning Chains for Cross-Modal Safety in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12060v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are susceptible to the implicit reasoning risk, wherein innocuous unimodal inputs synergistically assemble into risky multimodal data that produce harmful outputs. We attribute this vulnerability to the difficulty of MLLMs maintaining safety alignment through long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce Safe-Semantics-but-Unsafe-Interpretation (SSUI), the first dataset featuring interpretable reasoning paths tailored for such a cross-modal challenge. A novel training framework, Safety-aware Reasoning Path Optimization (SRPO), is also designed based on the SSUI dataset to align the MLLM's internal reasoning process with human safety values. Experimental results show that our SRPO-trained models achieve state-of-the-art results on key safety benchmarks, including the proposed Reasoning Path Benchmark (RSBench), significantly outperforming both open-source and top-tier commercial MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

To address this shortcoming, we present Avat3r, which regresses a high-quality and animatable 3D head avatar from just a few input images, vastly reducing compute requirements during inference. More specifically, we make Large Reconstruction Models animatable and learn a powerful prior over 3D human heads from a large multi-view video dataset. For better 3D head reconstructions, we employ position maps from DUSt3R and generalized feature maps from the human foundation model Sapiens. To animate the 3D head, our key discovery is that simple cross-attention to an expression code is already sufficient. Finally, we increase robustness by feeding input images with different expressions to our model during training, enabling the reconstruction of 3D head avatars from inconsistent inputs, e.g., an imperfect phone capture with accidental movement, or frames from a monocular video. We compare Avat3r with current state-of-the-art methods for few-input and single-input scenarios, and find that our method has a competitive advantage in both tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the wide applicability of our proposed model, creating 3D head avatars from images of different sources, smartphone captures, single images, and even out-of-domain inputs like antique busts.

We present AMQ, Automated Mixed-Precision Weight-Only Quantization, a framework that assigns layer-wise quantization bit-widths to optimally balance model quality and memory usage. However, the combinatorial search space, with over 10^{100} possible configurations, makes conventional black-box optimization infeasible. AMQ overcomes this challenge through four key innovations:(1) search space pruning using prior knowledge to exclude unpromising configurations, (2) quantization proxy to bypass costly format conversions during search, (3) quality predictor to minimize evaluation overhead, and (4) iterative search-and-update strategy for fast and stable convergence. By integrating these components, AMQ efficiently explores the quality-efficiency landscape, reaching the Pareto frontier and yielding LLMs that are both compact and high-performing.

Recently, the optimizer Muon \cite{jordanmuon}, which explicitly exploits this structure, has gained significant attention for its strong performance in foundation model training. A key component contributing to Muon's success is matrix orthogonalization. In this paper, we propose {\it low-rank orthogonalization}, which explicitly leverages the low-rank nature of gradients during NN training. Building on this, we propose low-rank matrix-signed gradient descent and a low-rank variant of Muon. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of low-rank orthogonalization, with the low-rank Muon achieving promising results in GPT-2 and LLaMA pretraining -- surpassing the performance of the carefully tuned vanilla Muon. Theoretically, we establish the iteration complexity of the low-rank matrix-signed gradient descent for finding an approximate stationary solution, as well as that of low-rank Muon for finding an approximate stochastic stationary solution under heavy-tailed noise.</p></details> | 27 pages |

Existing reward models, trained primarily on natural language outputs, struggle to evaluate tool-based reasoning and execution. To quantify this gap, we introduce FC-RewardBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically assess reward models' performance in tool-calling scenarios. Our analysis shows that current reward models often miss key signals of effective tool use, highlighting the need for domain-specific modeling. To address this, we propose a training framework for outcome-based reward models using data synthesized from permissively licensed, open-weight LLMs. We train models ranging from 1.7B to 14B parameters and evaluate them across seven out-of-domain benchmarks. These models consistently outperform general-purpose baselines, achieving up to 25\% average improvement in downstream task performance and enabling data-efficient fine-tuning through reward-guided filtering.</p></details> |  |

Although LLMs possess impressive capabilities, their internal mechanisms for processing and representing linguistic knowledge remain largely opaque. Prior research on linguistic mechanisms is limited by coarse granularity, limited analysis scale, and narrow focus. In this study, we propose LinguaLens, a systematic and comprehensive framework for analyzing the linguistic mechanisms of large language models, based on Sparse Auto-Encoders (SAEs). We extract a broad set of Chinese and English linguistic features across four dimensions (morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics). By employing counterfactual methods, we construct a large-scale counterfactual dataset of linguistic features for mechanism analysis. Our findings reveal intrinsic representations of linguistic knowledge in LLMs, uncover patterns of cross-layer and cross-lingual distribution, and demonstrate the potential to control model outputs. This work provides a systematic suite of resources and methods for studying linguistic mechanisms, offers strong evidence that LLMs possess genuine linguistic knowledge, and lays the foundation for more interpretable and controllable language modeling in future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 MainConference</p></details> |

This work investigates the PerspAct system [1], which integrates the ReAct (Reason and Act) paradigm with Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate developmental stages of perspective taking, grounded in Selman's theory [2]. Using an extended director task, we evaluate GPT's ability to generate internal narratives aligned with specified developmental stages, and assess how these influence collaborative performance both qualitatively (action selection) and quantitatively (task efficiency). Results show that GPT reliably produces developmentally-consistent narratives before task execution but often shifts towards more advanced stages during interaction, suggesting that language exchanges help refine internal representations. Higher developmental stages generally enhance collaborative effectiveness, while earlier stages yield more variable outcomes in complex contexts. These findings highlight the potential of integrating embodied perspective taking and language in LLMs to better model developmental dynamics and stress the importance of evaluating internal speech during combined linguistic and embodied tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICDL https://icdl2025.fel.cvut.cz/</p></details> |

A Quantitative Evaluation of various Large Language Models on Word Sense Disambiguation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18337v5)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ambiguous words are often found in modern digital communications. Lexical ambiguity challenges traditional Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) methods, due to limited data. Consequently, the efficiency of translation, information retrieval, and question-answering systems is hindered by these limitations. This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve WSD using a novel approach combining a systematic prompt augmentation mechanism with a knowledge base (KB) consisting of different sense interpretations. The proposed method incorporates a human-in-loop approach for prompt augmentation where prompt is supported by Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, synonyms of ambiguous words, aspect-based sense filtering and few-shot prompting to guide the LLM. By utilizing a few-shot Chain of Thought (COT) prompting-based approach, this work demonstrates a substantial improvement in performance. The evaluation was conducted using FEWS test data and sense tags. This research advances accurate word interpretation in social media and digital communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,6 tables, 1 figure, Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on NLP & AI for Cyber Security</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for ESC, they face two key challenges: (1) low strategy selection accuracy, and (2) preference bias, limiting their adaptability to emotional needs of users. Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) struggles to address these issues, as it rigidly trains models on single gold-standard responses without modeling nuanced strategy trade-offs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Chain-of-Strategy Optimization (CSO), a novel approach that optimizes strategy selection preferences at each dialogue turn. We first leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search to construct ESC-Pro, a high-quality preference dataset with turn-level strategy-response pairs. Training on ESC-Pro with CSO improves both strategy accuracy and bias mitigation, enabling LLMs to generate more empathetic and contextually appropriate responses. Experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9B, and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that CSO outperforms standard SFT, highlighting the efficacy of fine-grained, turn-level preference modeling in ESC.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, 17 tables</p></details> |
| **[From Evaluation to Enhancement: Large Language Models for Zero-Knowledge Proof Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11708v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are increasingly deployed in domains such as privacy-preserving authentication, blockchain scalability, and secure finance. However, authoring ZK programs remains challenging: unlike mainstream programming, ZK development requires reasoning about finite field arithmetic, constraint systems, and gadgets, making it knowledge-intensive and error-prone. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong code generation capabilities in general-purpose languages, their effectiveness for ZK programming, where correctness hinges on both language mastery and gadget-level reasoning, remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose \textsc{ZK-Eval}, a domain-specific evaluation pipeline that probes LLM capabilities at three levels: language knowledge, gadget competence, and end-to-end program generation. Our evaluation of four state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that models excel at surface-level syntax but struggle with gadget usage and semantic correctness, often yielding incorrect programs. Based on these insights, we introduce \textsc{ZK-Coder}, an agentic framework that augments LLMs with constraint sketching, guided retrieval, and interactive repair. Experiments on Circom and Noir show substantial gains, with success rates improving from 17.35\% to 83.38\% and from 32.21\% to 90.05\%, respectively. With \textsc{ZK-Eval} and \textsc{ZK-Coder}, we establish a foundation for systematically measuring and augmenting LLMs in ZK code generation to lower barriers for practitioners and advance trustworthy computation.</p></details> |  |

In such scenarios, the scale of the data or the scale of the graph may exceed the processing capacity of a single machine. This paper aims to address the graph construction problem of such scale via efficient graph merge. For the graph construction on a single node, two generic and highly parallelizable algorithms, namely Two-way Merge and Multi-way Merge are proposed to merge subgraphs into one. For the graph construction across multiple nodes, a multi-node procedure based on Two-way Merge is presented. The procedure makes it feasible to construct a large-scale k-NN graph/indexing graph on either a single node or multiple nodes when the data size exceeds the memory capacity of one node. Extensive experiments are conducted on both large-scale k-NN graph and indexing graph construction. For the k-NN graph construction, the large-scale and high-quality k-NN graphs are constructed by graph merge in parallel. Typically, a billion-scale k-NN graph can be built in approximately 17h when only three nodes are employed. For the indexing graph construction, similar NN search performance as the original indexing graph is achieved with the merged indexing graphs while requiring much less time of construction.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |
| **[RemixFusion: Residual-based Mixed Representation for Large-scale Online RGB-D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17594v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of the neural implicit representation has notably propelled the advancement of online dense reconstruction techniques. Compared to traditional explicit representations, such as TSDF, it improves the mapping completeness and memory efficiency. However, the lack of reconstruction details and the time-consuming learning of neural representations hinder the widespread application of neural-based methods to large-scale online reconstruction. We introduce RemixFusion, a novel residual-based mixed representation for scene reconstruction and camera pose estimation dedicated to high-quality and large-scale online RGB-D reconstruction. In particular, we propose a residual-based map representation comprised of an explicit coarse TSDF grid and an implicit neural module that produces residuals representing fine-grained details to be added to the coarse grid. Such mixed representation allows for detail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget, contrasting with the overly-smoothed results by the purely implicit representations, thus paving the way for high-quality camera tracking. Furthermore, we extend the residual-based representation to handle multi-frame joint pose optimization via bundle adjustment (BA). In contrast to the existing methods, which optimize poses directly, we opt to optimize pose changes. Combined with a novel technique for adaptive gradient amplification, our method attains better optimization convergence and global optimality. Furthermore, we adopt a local moving volume to factorize the mixed scene representation with a divide-and-conquer design to facilitate efficient online learning in our residual-based framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses all state-of-the-art ones, including those based either on explicit or implicit representations, in terms of the accuracy of both mapping and tracking on large-scale scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://lanlan96.github.io/RemixFusion/</p></details> |

Due to the suddenness and instability of news events, the authenticity labels of news can potentially shift as events develop, making it crucial for fake news detection to obtain the latest event updates. Existing methods employ retrieval-augmented generation to fill knowledge gaps, but they suffer from issues such as insufficient credibility of retrieved content and interference from noisy information. We propose a dynamic knowledge update-driven model for fake news detection (DYNAMO), which leverages knowledge graphs to achieve continuous updating of new knowledge and integrates with large language models to fulfill dual functions: news authenticity detection and verification of new knowledge correctness, solving the two key problems of ensuring the authenticity of new knowledge and deeply mining news semantics. Specifically, we first construct a news-domain-specific knowledge graph. Then, we use Monte Carlo Tree Search to decompose complex news and verify them step by step. Finally, we extract and update new knowledge from verified real news texts and reasoning paths. Experimental results demonstrate that DYNAMO achieves the best performance on two real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

A Comprehensive Study on Execution Trace-Based Information for Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11686v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have opened a new era in programming with their impressive capabilities. However, recent research has revealed critical limitations in their ability to reason about runtime behavior and understand the actual functionality of programs, which poses significant challenges for their post-training and practical deployment. Specifically, Code LLMs encounter two principal issues: (1) a lack of proficiency in reasoning about program execution behavior, as they struggle to interpret what programs actually do during runtime, and (2) the inconsistent and fragmented representation of semantic information, such as execution traces, across existing methods, which hinders their ability to generalize and reason effectively. These challenges underscore the necessity for more systematic approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Code LLMs. To address these issues, we introduce a generic framework to support integrating semantic information~(e.g., execution trace) to code task-relevant prompts, and conduct a comprehensive study to explore the role of semantic information in enhancing the reasoning ability of Code LLMs accordingly. Specifically, we focus on investigating the usefulness of trace-based semantic information in boosting supervised fine-tuning~(SFT) and post-phase inference of Code LLMs. The experimental results surprisingly disagree with previous works and demonstrate that semantic information has limited usefulness for SFT and test time scaling of Code LLM.</p></details> | EMNLP2025-findings |

Similar to Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL adopts native-resolution Vision Transformers, which enables it to process images at their original variable resolutions. This design avoids the degradation caused by fixed-resolution tiling while preserving fine-grained details and global layouts, which is crucial for visually dense content such as complex charts and diagrams. To ensure the smooth training of MindVL on Ascend NPUs, we develop Mindspeed-MLLM, a distributed multimodal training framework tailored for Ascend NPUs. To maintain training accuracy, we implement equivalent replacements for certain operators. MindVL undergoes a three-phase training process, namely the warm-up phase, multitask training phase, and supervised instruction tuning phase, to gradually enhance its capabilities. This process starts with basic visual and multimodal pre-training, followed by large-scale multiask trainging and instruction tuning. We also adopt multimodal data packaging and hybrid parallelism techniques, which significantly improve end-to-end training speed. To further boost model performance, we specifically introduce test-time resolution search and model weight averaging. Notably, despite using about 1/10 of the training data required by Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL in evaluations of general multimodal understanding and document/table comprehension. Beyond overall scores, MindVL also delivers leading performance in OCR assessments.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, existing research typically leverages the model's responses in English as a reference to select the best/worst responses in other languages, which are then used for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. However, we argue that there are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy multilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not all English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low quality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods usually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference pairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data selection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for improving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes two parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual consistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of constructing high-quality preference data.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |
| **[Multilingual Collaborative Defense for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11835v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The robustness and security of large language models (LLMs) has become a prominent research area. One notable vulnerability is the ability to bypass LLM safeguards by translating harmful queries into rare or underrepresented languages, a simple yet effective method of "jailbreaking" these models. Despite the growing concern, there has been limited research addressing the safeguarding of LLMs in multilingual scenarios, highlighting an urgent need to enhance multilingual safety. In this work, we investigate the correlation between various attack features across different languages and propose Multilingual Collaborative Defense (MCD), a novel learning method that optimizes a continuous, soft safety prompt automatically to facilitate multilingual safeguarding of LLMs. The MCD approach offers three advantages: First, it effectively improves safeguarding performance across multiple languages. Second, MCD maintains strong generalization capabilities while minimizing false refusal rates. Third, MCD mitigates the language safety misalignment caused by imbalances in LLM training corpora. To evaluate the effectiveness of MCD, we manually construct multilingual versions of commonly used jailbreak benchmarks, such as MaliciousInstruct and AdvBench, to assess various safeguarding methods. Additionally, we introduce these datasets in underrepresented (zero-shot) languages to verify the language transferability of MCD. The results demonstrate that MCD outperforms existing approaches in safeguarding against multilingual jailbreak attempts while also exhibiting strong language transfer capabilities.

Recent research has discovered emergent theory-of-mind (ToM) reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). LLMs can reason about people's mental states by solving various text-based ToM tasks that ask questions about the actors' ToM (e.g., human belief, desire, intention). However, human reasoning in the wild is often grounded in dynamic scenes across time. Thus, we consider videos a new medium for examining spatio-temporal ToM reasoning ability. Specifically, we ask explicit probing questions about videos with abundant social and emotional reasoning content. We develop a pipeline for multimodal LLM for ToM reasoning using video and text. We also enable explicit ToM reasoning by retrieving key frames for answering a ToM question, which reveals how multimodal LLMs reason about ToM.</p></details> |  |

However, the extent to which this high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from a Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as LLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a dataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians pursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate and compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the fine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12 medical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including medgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific prompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient fine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it utilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS: medgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of correct answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion parameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results <50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all LLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters across various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and research that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those exhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties should utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/rodrigo-carrillo/PeruMedQA</p></details> |
| **[LogicTree: Structured Proof Exploration for Coherent and Rigorous Logical Reasoning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14089v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities across various domains. However, LLMs still face distinct challenges in complex logical reasoning, as (1) proof-finding requires systematic exploration and the maintenance of logical coherence and (2) searching the right combination of premises at each reasoning step is inherently challenging in tasks with large premise space. To address this, we propose LogicTree, an inference-time modular framework employing algorithm-guided search to automate structured proof exploration and ensure logical coherence. Advancing beyond tree-of-thought (ToT), we incorporate caching mechanism into LogicTree to enable effective utilization of historical knowledge, preventing reasoning stagnation and minimizing redundancy. Furthermore, we address the combinatorial complexity of premise search by decomposing it into a linear process. The refined premise selection restricts subsequent inference to at most one derivation per step, enhancing reasoning granularity and enforcing strict step-by-step reasoning. Additionally, we introduce two LLM-free heuristics for premise prioritization, enabling strategic proof search. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that LogicTree optimally scales inference-time computation to achieve higher proof accuracy, surpassing chain-of-thought (CoT) and ToT with average gains of 23.6% and 12.5%, respectively, on GPT-4o. Moreover, within LogicTree, GPT-4o outperforms o3-mini by 7.6% on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we present a robotic solution for real-time sampling, analysis and mapping of key soil properties. Our system consists of two main sub-systems: a Sample Acquisition System (SAS) for precise, automated in-field soil sampling; and a Sample Analysis Lab (Lab) for real-time soil property analysis. The system's performance was validated through extensive field trials at a large-scale Australian farm. Experimental results show that the SAS can consistently acquire soil samples with a mass of 50g at a depth of 200mm, while the Lab can process each sample within 10 minutes to accurately measure pH and macronutrients. These results demonstrate the potential of the system to provide farmers with timely, data-driven insights for more efficient and sustainable soil management and fertilizer application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 IEEE ICRA Workshop on Field Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Large language model-empowered next-generation computer-aided engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11447v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software development has entered a new era where large language models (LLMs) now serve as general-purpose reasoning engines, enabling natural language interaction and transformative applications across diverse domains. This paradigm is now extending into computer-aided engineering (CAE). Recent applications of LLMs in CAE have successfully automated routine tasks, including CAD model generation and FEM simulations. Nevertheless, these contributions, which primarily serve to reduce manual labor, are often insufficient for addressing the significant computational challenges posed by large-scale, high-dimensional systems. To this aim, we first introduce the concept of LLM-empowered CAE agent, where LLMs act as autonomous collaborators that plan, execute, and adapt CAE workflows. Then, we propose an LLM-empowered CAE agent for data-free model order reduction (MOR), a powerful yet underused approach for ultra-fast large-scale parametric analysis due to the intrusive nature and labor-intensive redevelopment of solvers. LLMs can alleviate this barrier by automating derivations, code restructuring, and implementation, making intrusive MOR both practical and broadly accessible. To demonstrate feasibility, we present an LLM-empowered CAE agent for solving ultra-large-scale space-parameter-time (S-P-T) physical problems using Tensor-decomposition-based A Priori Surrogates (TAPS). Our results show that natural language prompts describing parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) can be translated into efficient solver implementations, substantially reducing human effort while producing high-fidelity reduced-order models. Moreover, LLMs can synthesize novel MOR solvers for unseen cases such as nonlinear and high-dimensional parametric problems based on their internal knowledge base. This highlights the potential of LLMs to establish the foundation for next-generation CAE systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models (LLMs) for Requirements Engineering (RE): A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11446v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are finding applications in numerous domains, and Requirements Engineering (RE) is increasingly benefiting from their capabilities to assist with complex, language-intensive tasks. This paper presents a systematic literature review of 74 primary studies published between 2023 and 2024, examining how LLMs are being applied in RE. The study categorizes the literature according to several dimensions, including publication trends, RE activities, prompting strategies, and evaluation methods. Our findings indicate notable patterns, among which we observe substantial differences compared to previous works leveraging standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Most of the studies focus on using LLMs for requirements elicitation and validation, rather than defect detection and classification, which were dominant in the past. Researchers have also broadened their focus and addressed novel tasks, e.g., test generation, exploring the integration of RE with other software engineering (SE) disciplines. Although requirements specifications remain the primary focus, other artifacts are increasingly considered, including issues from issue tracking systems, regulations, and technical manuals. The studies mostly rely on GPT-based models, and often use Zero-shot or Few-shot prompting. They are usually evaluated in controlled environments, with limited use in industry settings and limited integration in complex workflows. Our study outlines important future directions, such as leveraging the potential to expand the influence of RE in SE, exploring less-studied tasks, improving prompting methods, and testing in real-world environments. Our contribution also helps researchers and practitioners use LLMs more effectively in RE, by providing a list of identified tools leveraging LLMs for RE, as well as datasets.</p></details> |  |

Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to democratize data access by automating data collection from unstructured sources. We develop and evaluate a novel methodology using GPT-4o-mini within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to collect data from corporate disclosures. Our approach achieves human-level accuracy in collecting CEO pay ratios from approximately 10,000 proxy statements and Critical Audit Matters (CAMs) from more than 12,000 10-K filings, with LLM processing times of 9 and 40 minutes respectively, each at a cost under US $10. This stands in stark contrast to the hundreds of hours needed for manual collection or the thousands of dollars required for commercial database subscriptions. To foster a more inclusive research community by empowering researchers with limited resources to explore new avenues of inquiry, we share our methodology and the resulting datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>58 pa...</summary><p>58 pagegs, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

This study presents a novel integrated framework combining state-of-the-art large language models (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with advanced prompt engineering techniques and multimodal data fusion for comprehensive reservoir analysis. The framework implements domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with over 50,000 petroleum engineering documents, chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot learning for rapid field adaptation. Multimodal integration processes seismic interpretations, well logs, and production data through specialized AI models with vision transformers. Field validation across 15 diverse reservoir environments demonstrates exceptional performance: 94.2% reservoir characterization accuracy, 87.6% production forecasting precision, and 91.4% well placement optimization success rate. The system achieves sub-second response times while maintaining 96.2% safety reliability with no high-risk incidents during evaluation. Economic analysis reveals 62-78% cost reductions (mean 72%) relative to traditional methods with 8-month payback period. Few-shot learning reduces field adaptation time by 72%, while automated prompt optimization achieves 89% improvement in reasoning quality. The framework processed real-time data streams with 96.2% anomaly detection accuracy and reduced environmental incidents by 45%. We provide detailed experimental protocols, baseline comparisons, ablation studies, and statistical significance testing to ensure reproducibility. This research demonstrates practical integration of cutting-edge AI technologies with petroleum domain expertise for enhanced operational efficiency, safety, and economic performance.</p></details> |  |

A Study on Recency Bias in LLM-Based Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11353v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in information systems, including being used as second-stage rerankers in information retrieval pipelines, yet their susceptibility to recency bias has received little attention. We investigate whether LLMs implicitly favour newer documents by prepending artificial publication dates to passages in the TREC Deep Learning passage retrieval collections in 2021 (DL21) and 2022 (DL22). Across seven models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, GPT-4, LLaMA-3 8B/70B, and Qwen-2.5 7B/72B, "fresh" passages are consistently promoted, shifting the Top-10's mean publication year forward by up to 4.78 years and moving individual items by as many as 95 ranks in our listwise reranking experiments. Although larger models attenuate the effect, none eliminate it. We also observe that the preference of LLMs between two passages with an identical relevance level can be reversed by up to 25% on average after date injection in our pairwise preference experiments. These findings provide quantitative evidence of a pervasive recency bias in LLMs and highlight the importance of effective bias-mitigation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[MatQnA: A Benchmark Dataset for Multi-modal Large Language Models in Materials Characterization and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11335v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in general domains such as programming and writing, and have demonstrated strong potential in various scientific research scenarios. However, the capabilities of AI models in the highly specialized field of materials characterization and analysis have not yet been systematically or sufficiently validated. To address this gap, we present MatQnA, the first multi-modal benchmark dataset specifically designed for material characterization techniques. MatQnA includes ten mainstream characterization methods, such as X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), etc. We employ a hybrid approach combining LLMs with human-in-the-loop validation to construct high-quality question-answer pairs, integrating both multiple-choice and subjective questions. Our preliminary evaluation results show that the most advanced multi-modal AI models (e.g., GPT-4.1, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, and Doubao Vision Pro 32K) have already achieved nearly 90% accuracy on objective questions in materials data interpretation and analysis tasks, demonstrating strong potential for applications in materials characterization and analysis.

| **[Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by Self-Injecting Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11287v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from serious hallucination problems, where the model-generated responses are inconsistent with the visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are mainly based on preference alignment and require external human annotations or auxiliary models for preference data collection, which increase costs and limit sustainable improvement. To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference Alignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that mitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the target LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a pair of responses with varying preference levels. During the self-injection process, the dis-preferred response is generated based on three key observations of hallucinations, ensuring it simulates real hallucination patterns. This fidelity offers an accurate learning signal for hallucination mitigation. Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training strategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the preference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous enhancement of the LVLM. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show that APASI not only effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models but also achieves comparable or even superior performance to alignment-based methods with external dependency, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization capability. The code is available at https://github.com/davidluciolu/APASI.</p></details> | emnlp 2025 accepted |

However, these methods produce holistic scores that obscure which specific elements influenced the assessments. We propose functional fragmentation, a method that dissects each output into key fragments and interprets the rhetoric functions that each fragment serves relative to evaluation criteria -- surfacing the elements of interest and revealing how they fulfill or hinder user goals. We instantiate this approach in Evalet, an interactive system that visualizes fragment-level functions across many outputs to support inspection, rating, and comparison of evaluations. A user study (N=10) found that, while practitioners struggled to validate holistic scores, our approach helped them identify 48% more evaluation misalignments. This helped them calibrate trust in LLM evaluations and rely on them to find more actionable issues in model outputs. Our work shifts LLM evaluation from quantitative scores toward qualitative, fine-grained analysis of model behavior.</p></details> |  |

This phenomenon poses a substantial challenge to the reliability of LLMs in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we survey recent efforts on the detection, explanation, and mitigation of hallucination, with an emphasis on the unique challenges posed by LLMs. We present taxonomies of the LLM hallucination phenomena and evaluation benchmarks, analyze existing approaches aiming at mitigating LLM hallucination, and discuss potential directions for future research.</p></details> | work in progress; |

This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware, potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

EasyEdit2 supports a wide range of test-time interventions, including safety, sentiment, personality, reasoning patterns, factuality, and language features. Unlike its predecessor, EasyEdit2 features a new architecture specifically designed for seamless model steering. It comprises key modules such as the steering vector generator and the steering vector applier, which enable automatic generation and application of steering vectors to influence the model's behavior without modifying its parameters. One of the main advantages of EasyEdit2 is its ease of use-users do not need extensive technical knowledge. With just a single example, they can effectively guide and adjust the model's responses, making precise control both accessible and efficient. Empirically, we report model steering performance across different LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques. We have released the source code on GitHub at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit along with a demonstration notebook.

However, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on objective visual question answering or captioning, inadequately assessing the models' ability to understand complex and subjective human emotions. To bridge this gap, we introduce EmoBench-Reddit, a novel, hierarchical benchmark for multimodal emotion understanding. The dataset comprises 350 meticulously curated samples from the social media platform Reddit, each containing an image, associated user-provided text, and an emotion category (sad, humor, sarcasm, happy) confirmed by user flairs. We designed a hierarchical task framework that progresses from basic perception to advanced cognition, with each data point featuring six multiple-choice questions and one open-ended question of increasing difficulty. Perception tasks evaluate the model's ability to identify basic visual elements (e.g., colors, objects), while cognition tasks require scene reasoning, intent understanding, and deep empathy integrating textual context. We ensured annotation quality through a combination of AI assistance (Claude 4) and manual verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthesize-on-Graph: Knowledgeable Synthetic Data Generation for Continue Pre-training of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00979v3)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success but remain data-inefficient, especially when learning from small, specialized corpora with limited and proprietary data. Existing synthetic data generation methods for continue pre-training focus on intra-document content and overlook cross-document knowledge associations, limiting content diversity and depth. We propose Synthetic-on-Graph (SoG), a synthetic data generation framework that incorporates cross-document knowledge associations for efficient corpus expansion. SoG constructs a context graph by extracting entities and concepts from the original corpus, representing cross-document associations, and employing a graph walk strategy for knowledge-associated sampling. This enhances synthetic data diversity and coherence, enabling models to learn complex knowledge structures and handle rare knowledge. To further improve the quality of synthetic data, we integrate two complementary strategies, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Contrastive Clarifying (CC), to enhance both reasoning capability and discriminative power. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoG surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on multi-hop and domain-specific question answering, while achieving competitive performance on long-context reading comprehension. These results highlight the superior generalization ability of SoG. Our work advances the paradigm of synthetic data generation and offers practical solutions for efficient knowledge acquisition in LLMs, particularly for downstream tasks and domains with limited training data.</p></details> |  |

However, the complex traits and heterogeneity of multi-sources genomics data pose significant challenges when adapting these models to the bioinformatics and biomedical field. To address these challenges, we present GP-GPT, the first specialized large language model for genetic-phenotype knowledge representation and genomics relation analysis. Our model is fine-tuned in two stages on a comprehensive corpus composed of over 3,000,000 terms in genomics, proteomics, and medical genetics, derived from multiple large-scale validated datasets and scientific publications. GP-GPT demonstrates proficiency in accurately retrieving medical genetics information and performing common genomics analysis tasks, such as genomics information retrieval and relationship determination. Comparative experiments across domain-specific tasks reveal that GP-GPT outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs, including Llama2, Llama3 and GPT-4. These results highlight GP-GPT's potential to enhance genetic disease relation research and facilitate accurate and efficient analysis in the fields of genomics and medical genetics. Our investigation demonstrated the subtle changes of bio-factor entities' representations in the GP-GPT, which suggested the opportunities for the application of LLMs to advancing gene-phenotype research.</p></details> |  |

| **[Tractable Asymmetric Verification for Large Language Models via Deterministic Replicability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11068v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) shifts rapidly towards dynamic, multi-agent systems. This introduces a fundamental challenge in establishing computational trust, specifically how one agent can verify that another's output was genuinely produced by a claimed LLM, and not falsified or generated by a cheaper or inferior model. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a verification framework that achieves tractable asymmetric effort, where the cost to verify a computation is substantially lower than the cost to perform it. Our approach is built upon the principle of deterministic replicability, a property inherent to autoregressive models that strictly necessitates a computationally homogeneous environment where all agents operate on identical hardware and software stacks. Within this defined context, our framework enables multiple validators to probabilistically audit small, random segments of an LLM's output and it distributes the verification workload effectively. The simulations demonstrated that targeted verification can be over 12 times faster than full regeneration, with tunable parameters to adjust the detection probability. By establishing a tractable mechanism for auditable LLM systems, our work offers a foundational layer for responsible AI and serves as a cornerstone for future research into the more complex, heterogeneous multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |

A dual functional factor model structure is adopted with a high-dimensional factor model for the observed curve time series and a low-dimensional factor model for the latent curves with common trends. A functional PCA technique is applied to estimate the common stochastic trends and functional factor loadings. Under some regularity conditions we derive the mean square convergence and limit distribution theory for the developed estimates, allowing the dimension and sample size to jointly diverge to infinity. We propose an easy-to-implement criterion to consistently select the number of common stochastic trends and further discuss model estimation when the nonstationary factors are cointegrated. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations and two empirical applications to large-scale temperature curves in Australia and log-price curves of S&P 500 stocks are conducted, showing finite-sample performance and providing practical implementations of the new methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[BERT4beam: Large AI Model Enabled Generalized Beamforming Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11056v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to emerge as a pivotal enabler for the forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication systems. However, current research efforts regarding large AI models for wireless communications primarily focus on fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks. This paper investigates the large-scale AI model designed for beamforming optimization to adapt and generalize to diverse tasks defined by system utilities and scales. We propose a novel framework based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), termed BERT4beam. We aim to formulate the beamforming optimization problem as a token-level sequence learning task, perform tokenization of the channel state information, construct the BERT model, and conduct task-specific pre-training and fine-tuning strategies. Based on the framework, we propose two BERT-based approaches for single-task and multi-task beamforming optimization, respectively. Both approaches are generalizable for varying user scales. Moreover, the former can adapt to varying system utilities and antenna configurations by re-configuring the input and output module of the BERT model, while the latter, termed UBERT, can directly generalize to diverse tasks, due to a finer-grained tokenization strategy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the two proposed approaches can achieve near-optimal performance and outperform existing AI models across various beamforming optimization tasks, showcasing strong adaptability and generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Persona-Based Synthetic Data Generation Using Multi-Stage Conditioning with Large Language Models for Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13380v2)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of emotion recognition, the development of high-performance models remains a challenge due to the scarcity of high-quality, diverse emotional datasets. Emotional expressions are inherently subjective, shaped by individual personality traits, socio-cultural backgrounds, and contextual factors, making large-scale, generalizable data collection both ethically and practically difficult. To address this issue, we introduce PersonaGen, a novel framework for generating emotionally rich text using a Large Language Model (LLM) through multi-stage persona-based conditioning. PersonaGen constructs layered virtual personas by combining demographic attributes, socio-cultural backgrounds, and detailed situational contexts, which are then used to guide emotion expression generation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of the generated synthetic data, assessing semantic diversity through clustering and distributional metrics, human-likeness via LLM-based quality scoring, realism through comparison with real-world emotion corpora, and practical utility in downstream emotion classification tasks. Experimental results show that PersonaGen significantly outperforms baseline methods in generating diverse, coherent, and discriminative emotion expressions, demonstrating its potential as a robust alternative for augmenting or replacing real-world emotional datasets.</p></details> |  |

We propose Soft Reasoning, an embedding-based search framework that optimises the embedding of the first token to guide generation. It combines (1) embedding perturbation for controlled exploration and (2) Bayesian optimisation to refine embeddings via a verifier-guided objective, balancing exploration and exploitation. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and coherence while avoiding reliance on heuristic search. Experiments demonstrate superior correctness with minimal computation, making it a scalable, model-agnostic solution.

Achieving large-area, full-body soft coverage with high sensitivity and rapid response, akin to human skin, remains a formidable challenge due to critical bottlenecks in encoding efficiency and wiring complexity in existing flexible tactile sensors, thus significantly hinder the scalability and real-time performance required for human skin-level tactile perception. Herein, we present a new architecture employing code division multiple access-inspired orthogonal digital encoding to overcome these challenges. Our decentralized encoding strategy transforms conventional serial signal transmission by enabling parallel superposition of energy-orthogonal base codes from distributed sensing nodes, drastically reducing wiring requirements and increasing data throughput. We implemented and validated this strategy with off-the-shelf 16-node sensing array to reconstruct the pressure distribution, achieving a temporal resolution of 12.8 ms using only a single transmission wire. Crucially, the architecture can maintain sub-20ms latency across orders-of-magnitude variations in node number (to thousands of nodes). By fundamentally redefining signal encoding paradigms in soft electronics, this work opens new frontiers in developing scalable embodied intelligent systems with human-like sensory capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 9 figures(Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models for Multi-Robot Systems: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03814v4)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities in Multi-Robot Systems (MRS), enabling enhanced communication, task planning, and human-robot interaction. Unlike traditional single-robot and multi-agent systems, MRS poses unique challenges, including coordination, scalability, and real-world adaptability. This survey provides the first comprehensive exploration of LLM integration into MRS. It systematically categorizes their applications across high-level task allocation, mid-level motion planning, low-level action generation, and human intervention. We highlight key applications in diverse domains, such as household robotics, construction, formation control, target tracking, and robot games, showcasing the versatility and transformative potential of LLMs in MRS. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that limit adapting LLMs in MRS, including mathematical reasoning limitations, hallucination, latency issues, and the need for robust benchmarking systems. Finally, we outline opportunities for future research, emphasizing advancements in fine-tuning, reasoning techniques, and task-specific models. This survey aims to guide researchers in the intelligence and real-world deployment of MRS powered by LLMs. Based on the fast-evolving nature of research in the field, we keep updating the papers in the open-source GitHub repository.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Security Operations Centers: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10858v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools capable of understanding and generating human-like text, offering transformative potential across diverse domains. The Security Operations Center (SOC), responsible for safeguarding digital infrastructure, represents one of these domains. SOCs serve as the frontline of defense in cybersecurity, tasked with continuous monitoring, detection, and response to incidents. However, SOCs face persistent challenges such as high alert volumes, limited resources, high demand for experts with advanced knowledge, delayed response times, and difficulties in leveraging threat intelligence effectively. In this context, LLMs can offer promising solutions by automating log analysis, streamlining triage, improving detection accuracy, and providing the required knowledge in less time. This survey systematically explores the integration of generative AI and more specifically LLMs into SOC workflow, providing a structured perspective on its capabilities, challenges, and future directions. We believe that this survey offers researchers and SOC managers a broad overview of the current state of LLM integration within academic study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to examine LLM applications in SOCs in details.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Models for Evidence-Based Clinical Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10843v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial progress in biomedical and clinical applications, motivating rigorous evaluation of their ability to answer nuanced, evidence-based questions. We curate a multi-source benchmark drawing from Cochrane systematic reviews and clinical guidelines, including structured recommendations from the American Heart Association and narrative guidance used by insurers. Using GPT-4o-mini and GPT-5, we observe consistent performance patterns across sources and clinical domains: accuracy is highest on structured guideline recommendations (90%) and lower on narrative guideline and systematic review questions (60--70%). We also find a strong correlation between accuracy and the citation count of the underlying systematic reviews, where each doubling of citations is associated with roughly a 30% increase in the odds of a correct answer. Models show moderate ability to reason about evidence quality when contextual information is supplied. When we incorporate retrieval-augmented prompting, providing the gold-source abstract raises accuracy on previously incorrect items to 0.79; providing top 3 PubMed abstracts (ranked by semantic relevance) improves accuracy to 0.23, while random abstracts reduce accuracy (0.10, within temperature variation). These effects are mirrored in GPT-4o-mini, underscoring that source clarity and targeted retrieval -- not just model size -- drive performance. Overall, our results highlight both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for evidence-based clinical question answering. Retrieval-augmented prompting emerges as a useful strategy to improve factual accuracy and alignment with source evidence, while stratified evaluation by specialty and question type remains essential to understand current knowledge access and to contextualize model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenUrban3D: Annotation-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation of Large-Scale Urban Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10842v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation enables models to recognize and segment objects from arbitrary natural language descriptions, offering the flexibility to handle novel, fine-grained, or functionally defined categories beyond fixed label sets. While this capability is crucial for large-scale urban point clouds that support applications such as digital twins, smart city management, and urban analytics, it remains largely unexplored in this domain. The main obstacles are the frequent absence of high-quality, well-aligned multi-view imagery in large-scale urban point cloud datasets and the poor generalization of existing three-dimensional (3D) segmentation pipelines across diverse urban environments with substantial variation in geometry, scale, and appearance. To address these challenges, we present OpenUrban3D, the first 3D open-vocabulary semantic segmentation framework for large-scale urban scenes that operates without aligned multi-view images, pre-trained point cloud segmentation networks, or manual annotations. Our approach generates robust semantic features directly from raw point clouds through multi-view, multi-granularity rendering, mask-level vision-language feature extraction, and sample-balanced fusion, followed by distillation into a 3D backbone model. This design enables zero-shot segmentation for arbitrary text queries while capturing both semantic richness and geometric priors. Extensive experiments on large-scale urban benchmarks, including SensatUrban and SUM, show that OpenUrban3D achieves significant improvements in both segmentation accuracy and cross-scene generalization over existing methods, demonstrating its potential as a flexible and scalable solution for 3D urban scene understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Siren Song of LLMs: How Users Perceive and Respond to Dark Patterns in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10830v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models can influence users through conversation, creating new forms of dark patterns that differ from traditional UX dark patterns. We define LLM dark patterns as manipulative or deceptive behaviors enacted in dialogue. Drawing on prior work and AI incident reports, we outline a diverse set of categories with real-world examples. Using them, we conducted a scenario-based study where participants (N=34) compared manipulative and neutral LLM responses. Our results reveal that recognition of LLM dark patterns often hinged on conversational cues such as exaggerated agreement, biased framing, or privacy intrusions, but these behaviors were also sometimes normalized as ordinary assistance. Users' perceptions of these dark patterns shaped how they respond to them. Responsibilities for these behaviors were also attributed in different ways, with participants assigning it to companies and developers, the model itself, or to users. We conclude with implications for design, advocacy, and governance to safeguard user autonomy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Generation of a Cryptography Misuse Taxonomy Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10814v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevalence of cryptographic API misuse (CAM) is compromising the effectiveness of cryptography and in turn the security of modern systems and applications. Despite extensive efforts to develop CAM detection tools, these tools typically rely on a limited set of predefined rules from human-curated knowledge. This rigid, rule-based approach hinders adaptation to evolving CAM patterns in real practices. We propose leveraging large language models (LLMs), trained on publicly available cryptography-related data, to automatically detect and classify CAMs in real-world code to address this limitation. Our method enables the development and continuous expansion of a CAM taxonomy, supporting developers and detection tools in tracking and understanding emerging CAM patterns. Specifically, we develop an LLM-agnostic prompt engineering method to guide LLMs in detecting CAM instances from C/C++, Java, Python, and Go code, and then classifying them into a hierarchical taxonomy. Using a data set of 3,492 real-world software programs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with mainstream LLMs, including GPT, Llama, Gemini, and Claude. It also allows us to quantitatively measure and compare the performance of these LLMs in analyzing CAM in realistic code. Our evaluation produced a taxonomy with 279 base CAM categories, 36 of which are not addressed by existing taxonomies. To validate its practical value, we encode 11 newly identified CAM types into detection rules and integrate them into existing tools. Experiments show that such integration expands the tools' detection capabilities.</p></details> | 23 pages, 9 figures |

However, existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity, sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Consistency and Reproducibility in the Outputs of Large Language Models: Evidence Across Diverse Finance and Accounting Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16974v4)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of consistency and reproducibility in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in finance and accounting research. We evaluate how consistently LLMs produce outputs given identical inputs through extensive experimentation with 50 independent runs across five common tasks: classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, text generation, and prediction. Using three OpenAI models (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o), we generate over 3.4 million outputs from diverse financial source texts and data, covering MD&As, FOMC statements, finance news articles, earnings call transcripts, and financial statements. Our findings reveal substantial but task-dependent consistency, with binary classification and sentiment analysis achieving near-perfect reproducibility, while complex tasks show greater variability. More advanced models do not consistently demonstrate better consistency and reproducibility, with task-specific patterns emerging. LLMs significantly outperform expert human annotators in consistency and maintain high agreement even where human experts significantly disagree. We further find that simple aggregation strategies across 3-5 runs dramatically improve consistency. We also find that aggregation may come with an additional benefit of improved accuracy for sentiment analysis when using newer models. Simulation analysis reveals that despite measurable inconsistency in LLM outputs, downstream statistical inferences remain remarkably robust. These findings address concerns about what we term "G-hacking," the selective reporting of favorable outcomes from multiple generative AI runs, by demonstrating that such risks are relatively low for finance and accounting tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>76 pa...</summary><p>76 pages, 20 tables, 12 figures</p></details> |

Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for generating scene descriptions, but their effectiveness for BLV users remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a user study with eight BLV participants to systematically evaluate preferences for six types of LVLM descriptions. While they helped to reduce fear and improve actionability, user ratings showed wide variation in sufficiency and conciseness. Furthermore, GPT-4o--despite its strong potential to refine descriptions--was not consistently preferred by participants. We use the insights obtained from the user study to build training data for building our new automatic evaluation metric that can capture BLV preferences effectively. Our findings underscore the urgent need for BLV-centered evaluation metrics and human-in-the-loop feedback to advance LVLM description quality for accessibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |

GraspMolmo predicts semantically appropriate, stable grasps conditioned on a natural language instruction and a single RGB-D frame. For instance, given "pour me some tea", GraspMolmo selects a grasp on a teapot handle rather than its body. Unlike prior TOG methods, which are limited by small datasets, simplistic language, and uncluttered scenes, GraspMolmo learns from PRISM, a novel large-scale synthetic dataset of 379k samples featuring cluttered environments and diverse, realistic task descriptions. We fine-tune the Molmo visual-language model on this data, enabling GraspMolmo to generalize to novel open-vocabulary instructions and objects. In challenging real-world evaluations, GraspMolmo achieves state-of-the-art results, with a 70% prediction success on complex tasks, compared to the 35% achieved by the next best alternative. GraspMolmo also successfully demonstrates the ability to predict semantically correct bimanual grasps zero-shot. We release our synthetic dataset, code, model, and benchmarks to accelerate research in task-semantic robotic manipulation, which, along with videos, are available at https://abhaybd.github.io/GraspMolmo/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-Scale Network Utility Maximization via GPU-Accelerated Proximal Message Passing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10722v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a GPU-accelerated proximal message passing algorithm for large-scale network utility maximization (NUM). NUM is a fundamental problem in resource allocation, where resources are allocated across various streams in a network to maximize total utility while respecting link capacity constraints. Our method, a variant of ADMM, requires only sparse matrix-vector multiplies with the link-route matrix and element-wise proximal operator evaluations, enabling fully parallel updates across streams and links. It also supports heterogeneous utility types, including logarithmic utilities common in NUM, and does not assume strict concavity. We implement our method in PyTorch and demonstrate its performance on problems with tens of millions of variables and constraints, achieving 4x to 20x speedups over existing CPU and GPU solvers and solving problem sizes that exhaust the memory of baseline methods. Additionally, we show that our algorithm is robust to congestion and link-capacity degradation. Finally, using a time-expanded transit seat allocation case study, we illustrate how our approach yields interpretable allocations in realistic networks.</p></details> |  |

However, these models face critical challenges when deployed in real-world applications, including hallucination generation, outdated knowledge, and limited domain expertise. Retrieval And Structuring (RAS) Augmented Generation addresses these limitations by integrating dynamic information retrieval with structured knowledge representations. This survey (1) examines retrieval mechanisms including sparse, dense, and hybrid approaches for accessing external knowledge; (2) explore text structuring techniques such as taxonomy construction, hierarchical classification, and information extraction that transform unstructured text into organized representations; and (3) investigate how these structured representations integrate with LLMs through prompt-based methods, reasoning frameworks, and knowledge embedding techniques. It also identifies technical challenges in retrieval efficiency, structure quality, and knowledge integration, while highlighting research opportunities in multimodal retrieval, cross-lingual structures, and interactive systems. This comprehensive overview provides researchers and practitioners with insights into RAS methods, applications, and future directions.</p></details> | KDD'25 survey track |

However, their utility in image-based applications remains unexplored. We investigate the effectiveness of LLMs for medical imaging tasks, specifically glioma classification and segmentation, and compare their performance to that of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using the BraTS 2020 dataset of multi-modal brain MRIs, we evaluated a general-purpose vision-language LLM (LLaMA 3.2 Instruct) both before and after fine-tuning, and benchmarked its performance against custom 3D CNNs. For glioma classification (Low-Grade vs. High-Grade), the CNN achieved 80% accuracy and balanced precision and recall. The general LLM reached 76% accuracy but suffered from a specificity of only 18%, often misclassifying Low-Grade tumors. Fine-tuning improved specificity to 55%, but overall performance declined (e.g., accuracy dropped to 72%). For segmentation, three methods - center point, bounding box, and polygon extraction, were implemented. CNNs accurately localized gliomas, though small tumors were sometimes missed. In contrast, LLMs consistently clustered predictions near the image center, with no distinction of glioma size, location, or placement. Fine-tuning improved output formatting but failed to meaningfully enhance spatial accuracy. The bounding polygon method yielded random, unstructured outputs. Overall, CNNs outperformed LLMs in both tasks. LLMs showed limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement from fine-tuning, indicating that, in their current form, they are not well-suited for image-based tasks. More rigorous fine-tuning or alternative training strategies may be needed for LLMs to achieve better performance, robustness, and utility in the medical space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety and Security Analysis of Large Language Models: Risk Profile and Harm Potential](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10655v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) holds great potential for society, their vulnerabilities to adversarial manipulation and exploitation can pose serious safety, security, and ethical risks. As new threats continue to emerge, it becomes critically necessary to assess the landscape of LLMs' safety and security against evolving adversarial prompt techniques. To understand the behavior of LLMs, this research provides an empirical analysis and risk profile of nine prominent LLMs, Claude Opus 4, DeepSeek V3 (both open-source and online), Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-4o, Grok 3, Llama 4 Scout, Mistral 7B, and Qwen 3 1.7B, against 24 different security and safety categories. These LLMs are evaluated on their ability to produce harmful responses for adversarially crafted prompts (dataset has been made public) for a broad range of safety and security topics, such as promotion of violent criminal behavior, promotion of non-violent criminal activity, societal harms related to safety, illegal sexual content, dangerous code generation, and cybersecurity threats beyond code. Our study introduces the Risk Severity Index (RSI), an agile and scalable evaluation score, to quantify and compare the security posture and creating a risk profile of LLMs. As the LLM development landscape progresses, the RSI is intended to be a valuable metric for comparing the risks of LLMs across evolving threats. This research finds widespread vulnerabilities in the safety filters of the LLMs tested and highlights the urgent need for stronger alignment, responsible deployment practices, and model governance, particularly for open-access and rapidly iterated models.</p></details> |  |

We introduce FairCoT, a novel framework that enhances fairness in text to image models through Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning within multimodal generative large language models. FairCoT employs iterative CoT refinement to systematically mitigate biases, and dynamically adjusts textual prompts in real time, ensuring diverse and equitable representation in generated images. By integrating iterative reasoning processes, FairCoT addresses the limitations of zero shot CoT in sensitive scenarios, balancing creativity with ethical responsibility. Experimental evaluations across popular text-to-image systems including DALLE and various Stable Diffusion variants, demonstrate that FairCoT significantly enhances fairness and diversity without sacrificing image quality or semantic fidelity. By combining robust reasoning, lightweight deployment, and extensibility to multiple models, FairCoT represents a promising step toward more socially responsible and transparent AI driven content generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, there has been no comprehensive empirical study of their performance for this increasingly important LLM-based Software Engineering application. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating BugFarm and LLMorpheus (the two state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches), alongside seven LLMs using our newly designed prompt, including both leading open- and closed-source models, on 851 real bugs from two Java real-world bug benchmarks. Our results reveal that, compared to existing rule-based approaches, LLMs generate more diverse mutants, that are behaviorally closer to real bugs and, most importantly, with 111.29% higher fault detection. That is, 87.98% (for LLMs) vs. 41.64% (for rule-based); an increase of 46.34 percentage points. Nevertheless, our results also reveal that these impressive results for improved effectiveness come at a cost: the LLM-generated mutants have worse non-compilability, duplication, and equivalent mutant rates by 26.60, 10.14, and 3.51 percentage points, respectively. These findings are immediately actionable for both research and practice. They allow practitioners to have greater confidence in deploying LLM-based mutation, while researchers now have a baseline for the state-of-the-art, with which they can research techniques to further improve effectiveness and reduce cost.</p></details> | 37 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Test-Time Warmup for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10641v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold great promise for advanced reasoning at the intersection of text and images, yet they have not fully realized this potential. MLLMs typically integrate an LLM, a vision encoder, and a connector that maps the vision encoder's embeddings into the LLM's text embedding space. Although each component is pretrained on massive datasets with billions of samples, the entire multimodal model is typically trained on only thousands (or a few million) samples, which can result in weak performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these shortcomings, instead of relying on extensive labeled datasets for fine-tuning, we propose a Test-Time Warmup method that adapts the MLLM per test instance by leveraging data from weakly supervised auxiliary tasks. With our approach, we observe a relative performance improvement of 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA on the Llama-Vision-Instruct model. Our method demonstrates that 'warming up' before inference can enhance MLLMs' robustness across diverse reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

While prior LALMs have shown strong performance on standard benchmarks, there has been alarming evidence that LALMs can hallucinate what is presented in the audio. To mitigate the hallucination of LALMs, we introduce Audio-Aware Decoding (AAD), a lightweight inference-time strategy that uses contrastive decoding to compare the token prediction logits with and without the audio context. By contrastive decoding, AAD promotes the tokens whose probability increases when the audio is present. We conduct our experiment on object hallucination datasets with three LALMs and show that AAD improves the F1 score by 0.046 to 0.428. We also show that AAD can improve the accuracy on general audio QA datasets like Clotho-AQA by 5.4% to 10.3%. We conduct thorough ablation studies to understand the effectiveness of each component in AAD.</p></details> |  |

Visual Language Action (VLA) models, pretrained on large-scale web datasets, have shown promise in decision-making tasks. However, previous work has primarily focused on action post-training, often neglecting enhancements to the foundational model itself. In response, we introduce a novel approach, Act from Visual Language Post-Training, which refines Visual Language Models (VLMs) through visual and linguistic guidance in a self-supervised manner. This enhancement improves the models' capabilities in world knowledge, visual recognition, and spatial grounding in open-world environments. Following the above post-training paradigms, we obtain the first VLA models in Minecraft that can follow human instructions on over 1k different atomic tasks, including crafting, smelting, cooking, mining, and killing. Our experiments demonstrate that post-training on non-trajectory tasks leads to a significant 40% improvement over the best agent baseline on a diverse set of atomic tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses traditional imitation learning-based policies in Minecraft, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We have open-sourced the code, models, and datasets to foster further research. The project page can be found in https://craftjarvis.github.io/JarvisVLA.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |

Here, we present MatSKRAFT, a computational framework that automatically extracts and integrates materials science knowledge from tabular data at unprecedented scale. Our approach transforms tables into graph-based representations processed by constraint-driven GNNs that encode scientific principles directly into model architecture. MatSKRAFT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art large language models, achieving F1 scores of 88.68 for property extraction and 71.35 for composition extraction, while processing data $19$-$496\times$ faster than them (compared to the slowest and the fastest models, respectively) with modest hardware requirements. Applied to nearly 69,000 tables from more than 47,000 research publications, we construct a comprehensive database containing over 535,000 entries, including 104,000 compositions that expand coverage beyond major existing databases, pending manual validation. This systematic approach reveals previously overlooked materials with distinct property combinations and enables data-driven discovery of composition-property relationships forming the cornerstone of materials and scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |

Specifically we show that the logarithmic perplexity of any large text generated by a language model must asymptotically converge to the average entropy of its token distributions. This defines a ``typical set'' that all long synthetic texts generated by a language model must belong to. We refine the concept of ''typical set'' to include only grammatically correct texts. We then show that this refined typical set is a vanishingly small subset of all possible grammatically correct texts for a very general definition of grammar. This means that language models are strongly constrained in the range of their possible behaviors and outputs. We make no simplifying assumptions (such as stationarity) about the statistics of language model outputs, and therefore our results are directly applicable to practical real-world models without any approximations. We discuss possible applications of the typical set concept to problems such as detecting synthetic texts and membership inference in training datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inpainting-Guided Policy Optimization for Diffusion Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10396v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as promising alternatives to autoregressive LLMs, offering competitive performance while supporting unique generation capabilities such as inpainting. We explore how inpainting can inform RL algorithm design for dLLMs. Aligning LLMs with reinforcement learning faces an exploration challenge: sparse reward signals and sample waste when models fail to discover correct solutions. While this inefficiency affects LLMs broadly, dLLMs offer a distinctive opportunity--their inpainting ability can guide exploration. We introduce IGPO (Inpainting Guided Policy Optimization), an RL framework that strategically inserts partial ground-truth reasoning traces during online sampling. Unlike providing full solutions, inpainting steers exploration toward promising trajectory spaces while preserving self-generated reasoning, bridging supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We apply IGPO to group-based optimization methods such as GRPO, where exploration failures cause zero advantages and gradients. IGPO restores meaningful gradients while improving sample efficiency. We also propose supervised fine-tuning on synthetically rewritten concise traces that better align with dLLM generation patterns. With additional techniques including entropy-based filtering, our training recipe yields substantial gains across three mathematical benchmarks--GSM8K, Math500, and AMC--achieving new state-of-the-art results for full-attention masked dLLMs.</p></details> | preprint; 21 pages |

After applying a Hopf-Cole transform to the distribution function, the system exhibits the behavior of rare events, which in the limit is governed by a non-standard, nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobi equation, as identified in [E. Bouin et al., J. Lond. Math. Soc., II. Ser., 2023]. The proposed scheme efficiently handles the stiffness introduced by scaling, with a computational cost that remains uniform with respect to the small parameter. It takes advantage of the conservation properties of the original kinetic model to overcome the numerical challenges posed by stiffness. The scheme satisfies a discrete maximum principle, preserves equilibrium states, and correctly captures the asymptotic limit, recovering the viscosity solution of the limit nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobi equation. As the limit problem is non-standard, convergence results from the literature are not directly applicable. We introduce new analytical tools based on a discrete representation formula that links the numerical scheme with the continuous setting. This allows us to prove the convergence and establish key structural properties of the method. Numerical tests support the analysis and illustrate the robustness of the scheme and the original behavior of the limit system.</p></details> |  |

Although robots are already excellent at avoiding sparse obstacles, they still struggle in traversing cluttered large obstacles. To make progress, we need to better understand how to use and control the physical interaction with obstacles to traverse them. Forest floor-dwelling cockroaches can use physical interaction to transition between different locomotor modes to traverse flexible, grass-like beams of a large range of stiffness. Inspired by this, here we studied whether and how environmental force sensing helps robots make active adjustments to traverse cluttered large obstacles. We developed a physics model and a simulation of a minimalistic robot capable of sensing environmental forces during traversal of beam obstacles. Then, we developed a force-feedback control strategy, which estimated beam stiffness from the sensed contact force using the physics model. Then in simulation we used the estimated stiffness to control the robot to either stay in or transition to the more favorable locomotor modes to traverse. When beams were stiff, force sensing induced the robot to transition from a more costly pitch mode to a less costly roll mode, which helped the robot traverse with a higher success rate and less energy consumed. By contrast, if the robot simply pushed forward or always avoided obstacles, it would consume more energy, become stuck in front of beams, or even flip over. When the beams were flimsy, force sensing guided the robot to simply push across the beams. In addition, we demonstrated the robustness of beam stiffness estimation against body oscillations, randomness in oscillation, and uncertainty in position sensing. We also found that a shorter sensorimotor delay reduced energy cost of traversal.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-scale Aerial Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-aided Robust Anti-jamming Transmission](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10280v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ARIS), deployed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), could enhance anti-jamming communication performance by dynamically configuring channel conditions and establishing reliable air-ground links. However, large-scale ARIS faces critical deployment challenges due to the prohibitive computational complexity of conventional discrete optimization methods and sophisticated jamming threats. In this paper, we introduce a mean field modeling approach to design the spatial configuration of ARIS by a continuous density function, thus bypassing high-dimensional combinatorial optimization. We consider an adaptive jammer which adjusts its position and beamforming to minimize the sum-rate. A key finding reveals that the jammer's optimal strategy is governed by a proximity-directivity trade-off between reducing path loss and enhancing spatial focusing. To combat the jamming, we propose a robust anti-jamming transmission framework that jointly optimizes the BS beamforming, the ARIS reflection, and the ARIS spatial distribution to maximize the worst-case sum-rate. By leveraging variational optimization and Riemannian manifold methods, we efficiently solve the functional optimization problems. Our analysis further unveils that the optimal ARIS deployment follows a spatial water-filling principle, concentrating resources in high-gain regions while avoiding interference-prone areas. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework remarkably improves the sum-rate. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is independent of the number of UAVs, validating its effectiveness for scalable ARIS-assisted anti-jamming communications.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

However, a persistent challenge is the prevalence of physical artifacts, such as anatomical and structural flaws, which severely degrade perceptual quality and limit application. Given the diversity and complexity of these artifacts, a systematic and fine-grained evaluation framework is required, which is lacking in current benchmarks. To fill this gap, we introduce MagicMirror, a comprehensive framework for artifacts assessment. We first establish a detailed taxonomy of generated image artifacts. Guided by this taxonomy, we manually annotate MagicData340K, the first human-annotated large-scale dataset of 340K generated images with fine-grained artifact labels. Building on this dataset, we train MagicAssessor, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that provides detailed assessments and corresponding labels. To overcome challenges like class imbalance and reward hacking, we design a novel data sampling strategy and a multi-level reward system for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Finally, we leverage MagicAssessor to construct MagicBench, an automated benchmark for evaluating the image artifacts of current T2I models. Our evaluation with MagicBench reveals that despite their widespread adoption, even top-tier models like GPT-image-1 are consistently plagued by significant artifacts, highlighting artifact reduction as a critical frontier for future T2I development.

| **[Embodied Navigation Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12129v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation is a fundamental capability in embodied AI, representing the intelligence required to perceive and interact within physical environments following language instructions. Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pku-epic.github.io/NavFoM-Web/</p></details> |

Leveraging Takens' embedding theorem, UDE as a dynamical representation of observed data constructs two-dimensional subspace patches from Hankel matrices, theoretically preserving dynamical and topological properties of underlying dynamical systems. Such patches are viewed as images, which can be efficiently processed by exploiting advanced deep learning technologies. Computationally, these patches further serve as tokens for learning a self-attention encoder, thus enabling accurate prediction of nonlinear time-series by a finite-dimensional Koopman operator in a linear manner in a latent space. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks and real-world climate datasets demonstrate over 20% average reduction in mean squared error versus state-of-the-art foundation models, alongside superior generalization in fine-tuning scenarios. In particular, the learned dynamical representations and Koopman operator prediction forms from the patches exhibit exceptional interpretability, with consistent identification of topologically informative subspaces and robust encoding of domain-invariant dynamics, establishing UDE as a scalable, interpretable framework for universal time-series modeling and forecasting with broad scientific and industrial applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundational theory for optimal decision tree problems. II. Optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12057v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision trees are a ubiquitous model for classification and regression tasks due to their interpretability and efficiency. However, solving the optimal decision tree (ODT) problem remains a challenging combinatorial optimization task. Even for the simplest splitting rules--axis-parallel hyperplanes--it is NP-hard to optimize. In Part I of this series, we rigorously defined the proper decision tree model through four axioms and, based on these, introduced four formal definitions of the ODT problem. From these definitions, we derived four generic algorithms capable of solving ODT problems for arbitrary decision trees satisfying the axioms. We also analyzed the combinatorial geometric properties of hypersurfaces, showing that decision trees defined by polynomial hypersurface splitting rules satisfy the proper axioms that we proposed. In this second paper (Part II) of this two-part series, building on the algorithmic and geometric foundations established in Part I, we introduce the first hypersurface decision tree (HODT) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, existing optimal decision tree methods are, to date, limited to hyperplane splitting rules--a special case of hypersurfaces--and rely on general-purpose solvers. In contrast, our HODT algorithm addresses the general hypersurface decision tree model without requiring external solvers. Using synthetic datasets generated from ground-truth hyperplane decision trees, we vary tree size, data size, dimensionality, and label and feature noise. Results showing that our algorithm recovers the ground truth more accurately than axis-parallel trees and exhibits greater robustness to noise. We also analyzed generalization performance across 30 real-world datasets, showing that HODT can achieve up to 30% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art optimal axis-parallel decision tree algorithm when tree complexity is properly controlled.</p></details> |  |

While DUSt3R and its successors have achieved breakthroughs in 3D reconstruction from unposed images, these methods exhibit significant limitations when scaling to multi-view scenarios, including high computational cost and cumulative error induced by global alignment. To address these challenges, we propose Regist3R, a novel stereo foundation model tailored for efficient and scalable incremental reconstruction. Regist3R leverages an incremental reconstruction paradigm, enabling large-scale 3D reconstructions from unordered and many-view image collections. We evaluate Regist3R on public datasets for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. Our experiments demonstrate that Regist3R achieves comparable performance with optimization-based methods while significantly improving computational efficiency, and outperforms existing multi-view reconstruction models. Furthermore, to assess its performance in real-world applications, we introduce a challenging oblique aerial dataset which has long spatial spans and hundreds of views. The results highlight the effectiveness of Regist3R. We also demonstrate the first attempt to reconstruct large-scale scenes encompassing over thousands of views through pointmap-based foundation models, showcasing its potential for practical applications in large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks, including urban modeling, aerial mapping, and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025. github link: https://github.com/Liu-SD/Regist3R</p></details> |

Recently, the optimizer Muon \cite{jordanmuon}, which explicitly exploits this structure, has gained significant attention for its strong performance in foundation model training. A key component contributing to Muon's success is matrix orthogonalization. In this paper, we propose {\it low-rank orthogonalization}, which explicitly leverages the low-rank nature of gradients during NN training. Building on this, we propose low-rank matrix-signed gradient descent and a low-rank variant of Muon. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of low-rank orthogonalization, with the low-rank Muon achieving promising results in GPT-2 and LLaMA pretraining -- surpassing the performance of the carefully tuned vanilla Muon. Theoretically, we establish the iteration complexity of the low-rank matrix-signed gradient descent for finding an approximate stationary solution, as well as that of low-rank Muon for finding an approximate stochastic stationary solution under heavy-tailed noise.</p></details> | 27 pages |

Specifically, YuE scales to trillions of tokens and generates up to five minutes of music while maintaining lyrical alignment, coherent musical structure, and engaging vocal melodies with appropriate accompaniment. It achieves this through (1) track-decoupled next-token prediction to overcome dense mixture signals, (2) structural progressive conditioning for long-context lyrical alignment, and (3) a multitask, multiphase pre-training recipe to converge and generalize. In addition, we redesign the in-context learning technique for music generation, enabling versatile style transfer (e.g., converting Japanese city pop into an English rap while preserving the original accompaniment) and bidirectional generation. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that YuE matches or even surpasses some of the proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility. In addition, fine-tuning YuE enables additional controls and enhanced support for tail languages. Furthermore, beyond generation, we show that YuE's learned representations can perform well on music understanding tasks, where the results of YuE match or exceed state-of-the-art methods on the MARBLE benchmark.

At the heart of the process lie two sophisticated families of codes: LDPC and polar codes. This paper opens the black box, not only by explaining how these codes are designed, but also by showing how they are encoded and decoded in practice. To map where research currently stands, we present a detailed survey of the literature supplemented with insights that are often buried deep within technical standards. These foundations are not just historical footnotes: they are strong candidates for powering error correction in 6G and beyond. In bringing clarity to these building blocks, we aim to help engineers and researchers navigate what is both a complex and increasingly vital part of wireless communication.</p></details> |  |
| **[RouteFinder: Towards Foundation Models for Vehicle Routing Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15007v4)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces RouteFinder, a comprehensive foundation model framework to tackle different Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) variants. Our core idea is that a foundation model for VRPs should be able to represent variants by treating each as a subset of a generalized problem equipped with different attributes. We propose a unified VRP environment capable of efficiently handling any combination of these attributes. The RouteFinder model leverages a modern transformer-based encoder and global attribute embeddings to improve task representation. Additionally, we introduce two reinforcement learning techniques to enhance multi-task performance: mixed batch training, which enables training on different variants at once, and multi-variant reward normalization to balance different reward scales. Finally, we propose efficient adapter layers that enable fine-tuning for new variants with unseen attributes. Extensive experiments on 48 VRP variants show RouteFinder outperforms recent state-of-the-art learning methods.

| **[A Fully Open and Generalizable Foundation Model for Ultrasound Clinical Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11752v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) that can effectively learn ultrasound representations by integrating multi-source data holds significant promise for advancing clinical care. However, the scarcity of large labeled datasets in real-world clinical environments and the limited generalizability of task-specific models have hindered the development of generalizable clinical AI models for ultrasound applications. In this study, we present EchoCare, a novel ultrasound foundation model for generalist clinical use, developed via self-supervised learning on our curated, publicly available, large-scale dataset EchoCareData. EchoCareData comprises 4.5 million ultrasound images, sourced from over 23 countries across 5 continents and acquired via a diverse range of distinct imaging devices, thus encompassing global cohorts that are multi-center, multi-device, and multi-ethnic. Unlike prior studies that adopt off-the-shelf vision foundation model architectures, we introduce a hierarchical classifier into EchoCare to enable joint learning of pixel-level and representation-level features, capturing both global anatomical contexts and local ultrasound characteristics. With minimal training, EchoCare outperforms state-of-the-art comparison models across 10 representative ultrasound benchmarks of varying diagnostic difficulties, spanning disease diagnosis, lesion segmentation, organ detection, landmark prediction, quantitative regression, imaging enhancement and report generation. The code and pretrained model are publicly released, rendering EchoCare accessible for fine-tuning and local adaptation, supporting extensibility to additional applications. EchoCare provides a fully open and generalizable foundation model to boost the development of AI technologies for diverse clinical ultrasound applications.</p></details> |  |

To fully exploit this information, it is essential to pretrain EO Foundation Models (FMs) on large unlabeled datasets, enabling efficient fine-tuning for several different downstream tasks with minimal labeled data. In this work, we present the scaling-up of our recently proposed EO Foundation Model, PhilEO Geo-Aware U-Net, on the unlabeled 23TB dataset MajorTOM, which covers the vast majority of the Earth's surface, as well as on the specialized subset FastTOM 2TB that does not include oceans and ice. We develop and study various PhilEO model variants with different numbers of parameters and architectures. We fine-tune the models on the PhilEO Bench for road density estimation, building density pixel-wise regression, and land cover semantic segmentation, and we evaluate the performance. Our results demonstrate that for all n-shots for road density regression, the PhilEO 44M MajorTOM 23TB model outperforms PhilEO Globe 0.5TB 44M. We also show that for most n-shots for road density estimation and building density regression, PhilEO 200M FastTOM outperforms all the other models we examine. The effectiveness of both dataset and model scaling is validated using the PhilEO Bench. We also study the impact of architecture scaling, transitioning from U-Net Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to Vision Transformers (ViT).</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 22 figures, 2 tables, 64 references</p></details> |
| **[Seeing Further on the Shoulders of Giants: Knowledge Inheritance for Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14707v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (VFMs) are predominantly developed using data-centric methods. These methods require training on vast amounts of data usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we present a new model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module. By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data. Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance segmentation.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[Two Sides of the Same Optimization Coin: Model Degradation and Representation Collapse in Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08401v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models, inspired by the success of LLMs, are designed to learn the optimal embedding from multi-domain TAGs for the downstream cross-task generalization capability. During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs; Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) - (1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale. Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAPTOR: A Foundation Policy for Quadrotor Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11481v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans are remarkably data-efficient when adapting to new unseen conditions, like driving a new car. In contrast, modern robotic control systems, like neural network policies trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL), are highly specialized for single environments. Because of this overfitting, they are known to break down even under small differences like the Simulation-to-Reality (Sim2Real) gap and require system identification and retraining for even minimal changes to the system. In this work, we present RAPTOR, a method for training a highly adaptive foundation policy for quadrotor control. Our method enables training a single, end-to-end neural-network policy to control a wide variety of quadrotors. We test 10 different real quadrotors from 32 g to 2.4 kg that also differ in motor type (brushed vs. brushless), frame type (soft vs. rigid), propeller type (2/3/4-blade), and flight controller (PX4/Betaflight/Crazyflie/M5StampFly). We find that a tiny, three-layer policy with only 2084 parameters is sufficient for zero-shot adaptation to a wide variety of platforms. The adaptation through In-Context Learning is made possible by using a recurrence in the hidden layer. The policy is trained through a novel Meta-Imitation Learning algorithm, where we sample 1000 quadrotors and train a teacher policy for each of them using Reinforcement Learning. Subsequently, the 1000 teachers are distilled into a single, adaptive student policy. We find that within milliseconds, the resulting foundation policy adapts zero-shot to unseen quadrotors. We extensively test the capabilities of the foundation policy under numerous conditions (trajectory tracking, indoor/outdoor, wind disturbance, poking, different propellers).</p></details> |  |

However, the high incidence of poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms or diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited generalizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task transferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel multimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to acquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is pre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second waveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track architecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality, leveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality signals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To efficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local quasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism within our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function, which combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect reconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation of frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models with varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy and practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks: false alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial fibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and ECG signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Accurate and reliable pain evaluation for the people suffering is crucial to developing effective and advanced pain management protocols. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support decision-making processes, ultimately aiming to alleviate distress and prevent functionality decline. This study introduces PainFormer, a vision foundation model based on multi-task learning principles trained simultaneously on 14 tasks/datasets with a total of 10.9 million samples. Functioning as an embedding extractor for various input modalities, the foundation model provides feature representations to the Embedding-Mixer, a transformer-based module that performs the final pain assessment. Extensive experiments employing behavioral modalities - including RGB, synthetic thermal, and estimated depth videos - and physiological modalities such as ECG, EMG, GSR, and fNIRS revealed that PainFormer effectively extracts high-quality embeddings from diverse input modalities. The proposed framework is evaluated on two pain datasets, BioVid and AI4Pain, and directly compared to 75 different methodologies documented in the literature. Experiments conducted in unimodal and multimodal settings demonstrate state-of-the-art performances across modalities and pave the way toward general-purpose models for automatic pain assessment.

We then categorize these advancements into two main approaches: prompt-based methods, which utilize large language models (LLMs) for instruction-based task execution, and training-based methods, which fine-tune multimodal models for mobile-specific applications. Additionally, we explore complementary technologies that augment agent performance. By discussing key challenges and outlining future research directions, this survey offers valuable insights for advancing mobile agent technologies.

The "no free lunch" theorem highlights that no single algorithm performs optimally across all problems. While online adaptation methods have been proposed, they often suffer from inefficiency, weak convergence, and limited generalization on constrained optimization problems (COPs). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework for automated component configuration in Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to address COPs, powered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Specifically, we propose SuperDE, a foundation model that dynamically configures DE's evolutionary components based on real-time evolution. Trained offline through meta-learning across a wide variety of COPs, SuperDE is capable of recommending optimal per-generation configurations for unseen problems in a zero-shot manner. Utilizing a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), SuperDE adapts its configuration strategies in response to the evolving population states during optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that SuperDE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark test suites, achieving superior generalization and optimization performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Medical Vision Foundation Models for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation via Active Learning and Selective Semi-supervised Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10784v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Vision Foundation Models (Med-VFMs) have superior capabilities of interpreting medical images due to the knowledge learned from self-supervised pre-training with extensive unannotated images. To improve their performance on adaptive downstream evaluations, especially segmentation, a few samples from target domains are selected randomly for fine-tuning them. However, there lacks works to explore the way of adapting Med-VFMs to achieve the optimal performance on target domains efficiently. Thus, it is highly demanded to design an efficient way of fine-tuning Med-VFMs by selecting informative samples to maximize their adaptation performance on target domains. To achieve this, we propose an Active Source-Free Domain Adaptation (ASFDA) method to efficiently adapt Med-VFMs to target domains for volumetric medical image segmentation. This ASFDA employs a novel Active Learning (AL) method to select the most informative samples from target domains for fine-tuning Med-VFMs without the access to source pre-training samples, thus maximizing their performance with the minimal selection budget. In this AL method, we design an Active Test Time Sample Query strategy to select samples from the target domains via two query metrics, including Diversified Knowledge Divergence (DKD) and Anatomical Segmentation Difficulty (ASD). DKD is designed to measure the source-target knowledge gap and intra-domain diversity. It utilizes the knowledge of pre-training to guide the querying of source-dissimilar and semantic-diverse samples from the target domains. ASD is designed to evaluate the difficulty in segmentation of anatomical structures by measuring predictive entropy from foreground regions adaptively. Additionally, our ASFDA method employs a Selective Semi-supervised Fine-tuning to improve the performance and efficiency of fine-tuning by identifying samples with high reliability from unqueried ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[CROSSAN: Towards Efficient and Effective Adaptation of Multiple Multimodal Foundation Models for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10307v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore a less-studied yet practically important problem: how to efficiently and effectively adapt multiple ($>$2) multimodal foundation models (MFMs) for the sequential recommendation task. To this end, we propose a plug-and-play Cross-modal Side Adapter Network (CROSSAN), which leverages a fully decoupled side adapter-based paradigm to achieve efficient and scalable adaptation. Compared to the state-of-the-art efficient approaches, CROSSAN reduces training time by over 30%, GPU memory consumption by 20%, and trainable parameters by over 57%, while enabling effective cross-modal learning across diverse modalities. To further enhance multimodal fusion, we introduce the Mixture of Modality Expert Fusion (MOMEF) mechanism. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that CROSSAN consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving 6.7%--8.1% performance improvements when adapting four foundation models with raw modalities. Moreover, the overall performance continues to improve as more MFMs are incorporated. We will release our code and datasets to faciliate future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building a General SimCLR Self-Supervised Foundation Model Across Neurological Diseases to Advance 3D Brain MRI Diagnoses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10620v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain scans are commonly acquired in clinical settings to monitor a wide range of neurological conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and stroke. While deep learning models have shown promising results analyzing 3D MRI across a number of brain imaging tasks, most are highly tailored for specific tasks with limited labeled data, and are not able to generalize across tasks and/or populations. The development of self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled the creation of large medical foundation models that leverage diverse, unlabeled datasets ranging from healthy to diseased data, showing significant success in 2D medical imaging applications. However, even the very few foundation models for 3D brain MRI that have been developed remain limited in resolution, scope, or accessibility. In this work, we present a general, high-resolution SimCLR-based SSL foundation model for 3D brain structural MRI, pre-trained on 18,759 patients (44,958 scans) from 11 publicly available datasets spanning diverse neurological diseases. We compare our model to Masked Autoencoders (MAE), as well as two supervised baselines, on four diverse downstream prediction tasks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Our fine-tuned SimCLR model outperforms all other models across all tasks. Notably, our model still achieves superior performance when fine-tuned using only 20% of labeled training samples for predicting Alzheimer's disease. We use publicly available code and data, and release our trained model at https://github.com/emilykaczmarek/3D-Neuro-SimCLR, contributing a broadly applicable and accessible foundation model for clinical brain MRI analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 Workshop CVAMD</p></details> |
| **[Attacking Attention of Foundation Models Disrupts Downstream Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05394v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models represent the most prominent and recent paradigm shift in artificial intelligence. Foundation models are large models, trained on broad data that deliver high accuracy in many downstream tasks, often without fine-tuning. For this reason, models such as CLIP , DINO or Vision Transfomers (ViT), are becoming the bedrock of many industrial AI-powered applications. However, the reliance on pre-trained foundation models also introduces significant security concerns, as these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Such attacks involve deliberately crafted inputs designed to deceive AI systems, jeopardizing their reliability. This paper studies the vulnerabilities of vision foundation models, focusing specifically on CLIP and ViTs, and explores the transferability of adversarial attacks to downstream tasks. We introduce a novel attack, targeting the structure of transformer-based architectures in a task-agnostic fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on several downstream tasks: classification, captioning, image/text retrieval, segmentation and depth estimation.

| **[Data distribution impacts the performance and generalisability of contrastive learning-based foundation models of electrocardiograms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10369v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning is a widely adopted self-supervised pretraining strategy, yet its dependence on cohort composition remains underexplored. We present Contrasting by Patient Augmented Electrocardiograms (CAPE) foundation model and pretrain on four cohorts (n = 5,203,352), from diverse populations across three continents (North America, South America, Asia). We systematically assess how cohort demographics, health status, and population diversity influence the downstream performance for prediction tasks also including two additional cohorts from another continent (Europe). We find that downstream performance depends on the distributional properties of the pretraining cohort, including demographics and health status. Moreover, while pretraining with a multi-centre, demographically diverse cohort improves in-distribution accuracy, it reduces out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation of our contrastive approach by encoding cohort-specific artifacts. To address this, we propose the In-Distribution Batch (IDB) strategy, which preserves intra-cohort consistency during pretraining and enhances OOD robustness. This work provides important insights for developing clinically fair and generalisable foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review at npj Digital Medicine</p></details> |

This paper presents the first and most comprehensive analysis of the intersection between Web3 and AI agents, examining five critical dimensions: landscape, economics, governance, security, and trust mechanisms. Through an analysis of 133 existing projects, we first develop a taxonomy and systematically map the current market landscape (RQ1), identifying distinct patterns in project distribution and capitalization. Building upon these findings, we further investigate four key integrations: (1) the role of AI agents in participating in and optimizing decentralized finance (RQ2); (2) their contribution to enhancing Web3 governance mechanisms (RQ3); (3) their capacity to strengthen Web3 security via intelligent vulnerability detection and automated smart contract auditing (RQ4); and (4) the establishment of robust reliability frameworks for AI agent operations leveraging Web3's inherent trust infrastructure (RQ5). By synthesizing these dimensions, we identify key integration patterns, highlight foundational challenges related to scalability, security, and ethics, and outline critical considerations for future research toward building robust, intelligent, and trustworthy decentralized systems with effective AI agent interactions.</p></details> |  |

However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors, introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.</p></details> | 6 Tables, 11 Figures |

Recently, interest has grown in developing foundation models for ECGs - models that generalise across diverse downstream tasks. However, consistent evaluation has been lacking: prior work often uses narrow task selections and inconsistent datasets, hindering fair comparison. Here, we introduce BenchECG, a standardised benchmark comprising a comprehensive suite of publicly available ECG datasets and versatile tasks. We also propose xECG, an xLSTM-based recurrent model trained with SimDINOv2 self-supervised learning, which achieves the best BenchECG score compared to publicly available state-of-the-art models. In particular, xECG is the only publicly available model to perform strongly on all datasets and tasks. By standardising evaluation, BenchECG enables rigorous comparison and aims to accelerate progress in ECG representation learning. xECG achieves superior performance over earlier approaches, defining a new baseline for future ECG foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 4 figures, 22 tables</p></details> |

While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt these models, studies often prioritize parameter efficiency, neglecting GPU memory and training speed. To address this, we introduced the IISAN framework, significantly enhancing efficiency. However, IISAN was limited to symmetrical MFMs and identical text and image encoders, preventing the use of state-of-the-art Large Language Models. To overcome this, we developed IISAN-Versa, a versatile plug-and-play architecture compatible with both symmetrical and asymmetrical MFMs. IISAN-Versa employs a Decoupled PEFT structure and utilizes both intra- and inter-modal adaptation. It effectively handles asymmetry through a simple yet effective combination of group layer-dropping and dimension transformation alignment. Our research demonstrates that IISAN-Versa effectively adapts large text encoders, and we further identify a scaling effect where larger encoders generally perform better. IISAN-Versa also demonstrates strong versatility in our defined multimodal scenarios, which include raw titles and captions generated from images and videos. Additionally, IISAN-Versa achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Microlens public benchmark. We release our code at https://github.com/GAIR-Lab/IISAN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)</p></details> |
| **[Can Generative Geospatial Diffusion Models Excel as Discriminative Geospatial Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07890v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized representation learning in Remote Sensing (RS), advancing Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) to leverage vast unlabeled satellite imagery for diverse downstream tasks. Currently, GFMs primarily employ objectives like contrastive learning or masked image modeling, owing to their proven success in learning transferable representations. However, generative diffusion models, which demonstrate the potential to capture multi-grained semantics essential for RS tasks during image generation, remain underexplored for discriminative applications. This prompts the question: can generative diffusion models also excel and serve as GFMs with sufficient discriminative power? In this work, we answer this question with SatDiFuser, a framework that transforms a diffusion-based generative geospatial foundation model into a powerful pretraining tool for discriminative RS. By systematically analyzing multi-stage, noise-dependent diffusion features, we develop three fusion strategies to effectively leverage these diverse representations. Extensive experiments on remote sensing benchmarks show that SatDiFuser outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs, achieving gains of up to +5.7% mIoU in semantic segmentation and +7.9% F1-score in classification, demonstrating the capacity of diffusion-based generative foundation models to rival or exceed discriminative GFMs. The source code is available at: https://github.com/yurujaja/SatDiFuser.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, camera ready</p></details> |

We prove a unique characterization of scoring functions via the maximum-entropy principle and establish necessity theorems for specific geometric choices.

The framework establishes principled foundations for temporal knowledge graph modeling with formal connections to differential geometric methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geological Everything Model 3D: A Promptable Foundation Model for Unified and Zero-Shot Subsurface Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00419v4)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding Earth's subsurface is critical for energy transition, natural hazard mitigation, and planetary science. Yet subsurface analysis remains fragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation, stratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each tightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We introduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative architecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference along latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This formulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference mechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs, masks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce geologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot generalization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining for new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage training process that combines self-supervised representation learning on large-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts and labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad applicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy analysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic stratigraphic interpretation, geobody segmentation, and property modeling. By bridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware manner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical AI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated, promptable reasoning system.

At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD (92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/dyzy41/PeftCD.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies have been limited by small datasets, under-representation of symptomatic non-TB patients, reliance on simple models, and recordings collected under idealised conditions. Methods We enrolled 512 participants at two hospitals in Zambia, grouped as bacteriologically confirmed TB (TB+), symptomatic patients with other respiratory diseases (OR), and healthy controls (HC). Usable cough recordings plus demographic and clinical data were obtained from 500 participants. Deep learning classifiers based on speech foundation models were trained on cough recordings. The best-performing model, trained on 3-second segments, was further evaluated with demographic and clinical features. Findings The best audio-only classifier achieved an AUROC of 85.2% for distinguishing TB+ from all others (TB+/Rest) and 80.1% for TB+ versus OR. Adding demographic and clinical features improved performance to 92.1% (TB+/Rest) and 84.2% (TB+/OR). At a threshold of 0.38, the multimodal model reached 90.3% sensitivity and 73.1% specificity for TB+/Rest, and 80.6% and 73.1% for TB+/OR. Interpretation Cough analysis using speech foundation models, especially when combined with demographic and clinical data, showed strong potential as a TB triage tool, meeting WHO target product profile benchmarks. The model was robust to confounding factors including background noise, recording time, and device variability, indicating detection of genuine disease-related acoustic patterns. Further validation across diverse regions and case definitions, including subclinical TB, is required before clinical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to The Lancet Digital Health</p></details> |

Although conventional deep learning methods have improved accuracy, they remain hindered by inherent limitations, including lack of interpretability, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated data, and weak generalization in long-tail scenarios. The rise of Large Foundation Models (LFMs) is transforming the research paradigm of trajectory prediction. This survey offers a systematic review of recent advances in LFMs, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for trajectory prediction. By integrating linguistic and scene semantics, LFMs facilitate interpretable contextual reasoning, significantly enhancing prediction safety and generalization in complex environments. The article highlights three core methodologies: trajectory-language mapping, multimodal fusion, and constraint-based reasoning. It covers prediction tasks for both vehicles and pedestrians, evaluation metrics, and dataset analyses. Key challenges such as computational latency, data scarcity, and real-world robustness are discussed, along with future research directions including low-latency inference, causality-aware modeling, and motion foundation models.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

While significant advances have been made in medical imaging, genetic biomarkers, and time series from electronic health records, the potential of foundation models for patient behavior monitoring through personal digital devices remains underexplored. The data generated by these devices are inherently heterogeneous, multisource, and often exhibit high rates of missing data, posing unique challenges.

We leveraged the discrete latent representation of this model to effectively perform two downstream tasks, suicide risk assessment and emotional state prediction, on different held-out clinical cohorts without the need of fine-tuning. We also highlight the existence of a trade-off between discrete and continuous latent structures, suggesting that hybrid models may be optimal for balancing accuracy across various supervised and unsupervised tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (32 with references and supplementary material).

| **[ALL-PET: A Low-resource and Low-shot PET Foundation Model in the Projection Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09130v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource, low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain. ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations. First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over 200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments, ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.</p></details> |  |

However, segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species, growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than supervised methods. Implementations are available at https://github.com/JunhaoXing/ZeroPlantSeg.</p></details> | WACV 2026 accepted |

Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is central to detecting cardiac abnormalities, yet challenges such as noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity limit current methods. To address these issues, we propose FoundationalECGNet, a foundational framework for automated ECG classification. The model integrates a dual-stage denoising by Morlet and Daubechies wavelets transformation, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Time Series Transformers (TST) to jointly capture spatial and temporal dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. FoundationalECGNet first distinguishes between Normal and Abnormal ECG signals, and then classifies the Abnormal signals into one of five cardiac conditions: Arrhythmias, Conduction Disorders, Myocardial Infarction, QT Abnormalities, or Hypertrophy. Across multiple datasets, the model achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal classification and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease detection, including a 99% F1-score for Conduction Disorders and Hypertrophy, as well as a 98.9% F1-score for Arrhythmias. Additionally, the model provides risk level estimations to facilitate clinical decision-making.

However, reliable interaction typically requires a 3D scene representation that is metric-scaled and aligned with the robot reference frame. This depends on accurate camera-to-robot calibration and dense 3D reconstruction, tasks usually treated separately, despite both relying on geometric correspondences from RGB data. Traditional calibration needs patterns, while RGB-based reconstruction yields geometry with an unknown scale in an arbitrary frame. Multi-camera setups add further complexity, as data must be expressed in a shared reference frame. We present Calib3R, a patternless method that jointly performs camera-to-robot calibration and metric-scaled 3D reconstruction via unified optimization. Calib3R handles single- and multi-camera setups on robot arms or mobile robots. It builds on the 3D foundation model MASt3R to extract pointmaps from RGB images, which are combined with robot poses to reconstruct a scaled 3D scene aligned with the robot. Experiments on diverse datasets show that Calib3R achieves accurate calibration with less than 10 images, outperforming target-less and marker-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRAM-R$^2$: Self-Training Generative Foundation Reward Models for Reward Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02492v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant progress in reward modeling over recent years has been driven by a paradigm shift from task-specific designs towards generalist reward models. Despite this trend, developing effective reward models remains a fundamental challenge: the heavy reliance on large-scale labeled preference data. Pre-training on abundant unlabeled data offers a promising direction, but existing approaches fall short of instilling explicit reasoning into reward models. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-training approach that leverages unlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning in reward models. Based on this approach, we develop GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model trained to produce not only preference labels but also accompanying reward rationales. GRAM-R$^2$ can serve as a foundation model for reward reasoning and can be applied to a wide range of tasks with minimal or no additional fine-tuning. It can support downstream applications such as response ranking and task-specific reward tuning. Experiments on response ranking, task adaptation, and reinforcement learning from human feedback demonstrate that GRAM-R$^2$ consistently delivers strong performance, outperforming several strong discriminative and generative baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Compositional Reasoning in Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06037v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance across a wide range of domains. However, a question remains: Do TSFMs succeed by memorizing patterns in training data, or do they possess the ability to reason about such patterns? While reasoning is a topic of great interest in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is undefined and largely unexplored in the context of TSFMs. In this work, inspired by language modeling literature, we formally define compositional reasoning in forecasting and distinguish it from in-distribution generalization. We evaluate the reasoning and generalization capabilities of 16 popular deep learning forecasting models on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, through controlled studies, we systematically examine which design choices in 7 popular open-source TSFMs contribute to improved reasoning capabilities. Our study yields key insights into the impact of TSFM architecture design on compositional reasoning and generalization. We find that patch-based Transformers have the best reasoning performance, closely followed by residualized MLP-based architectures, which are 97\% less computationally complex in terms of FLOPs and 86\% smaller in terms of the number of trainable parameters. Interestingly, in some zero-shot out-of-distribution scenarios, these models can outperform moving average and exponential smoothing statistical baselines trained on in-distribution data. Only a few design choices, such as the tokenization method, had a significant (negative) impact on Transformer model performance.</p></details> |  |

Recently, research has focused on Federated Source-Free Domain Adaptation (FFREEDA), a more realistic scenario wherein client-held target domain data remains unlabeled, and the server can access source domain data only during pre-training. We extend this framework to a more complex and realistic setting: Class Imbalanced FFREEDA (CI-FFREEDA), which takes into account class imbalances in both the source and target domains, as well as label shifts between source and target and among target clients. The replication of existing methods in our experimental setup lead us to rethink the focus from enhancing aggregation and domain adaptation methods to improving the feature extractors within the network itself. We propose replacing the FFREEDA backbone with a frozen vision foundation model (VFM), thereby improving overall accuracy without extensive parameter tuning and reducing computational and communication costs in federated learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that VFMs effectively mitigate the effects of domain gaps, class imbalances, and even non-IID-ness among target clients, suggesting that strong feature extractors, not complex adaptation or FL methods, are key to success in the real-world FL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the IEEE ICIP 2025 Satellite Workshop 1: Edge Intelligence: Smart, Efficient, and Scalable Solutions for IoT, Wearables, and Embedded Devices (SEEDS)</p></details> |

To better track and address this challenge, detailed and reliable mapping is needed to support sustainability efforts and emerging regulatory frameworks. We present an open-access geospatial dataset of oil palm plantations and related land cover types in Indonesia, produced through expert labeling of high-resolution satellite imagery from 2020 to 2024. The dataset provides polygon-based, wall-to-wall annotations across a range of agro-ecological zones and includes a hierarchical typology that distinguishes oil palm planting stages as well as similar perennial crops. Quality was ensured through multi-interpreter consensus and field validation. The dataset was created using wall-to-wall digitization over large grids, making it suitable for training and benchmarking both conventional convolutional neural networks and newer geospatial foundation models. Released under a CC-BY license, it fills a key gap in training data for remote sensing and aims to improve the accuracy of land cover types mapping. By supporting transparent monitoring of oil palm expansion, the resource contributes to global deforestation reduction goals and follows FAIR data principles.</p></details> |  |

This survey examines how these models address critical challenges in autonomous perception, including limitations in generalization, scalability, and robustness to distributional shifts. The survey introduces a novel taxonomy structured around four essential capabilities for robust performance in dynamic driving environments: generalized knowledge, spatial understanding, multi-sensor robustness, and temporal reasoning. For each capability, the survey elucidates its significance and comprehensively reviews cutting-edge approaches. Diverging from traditional method-centric surveys, our unique framework prioritizes conceptual design principles, providing a capability-driven guide for model development and clearer insights into foundational aspects. We conclude by discussing key challenges, particularly those associated with the integration of these capabilities into real-time, scalable systems, and broader deployment challenges related to computational demands and ensuring model reliability against issues like hallucinations and out-of-distribution failures. The survey also outlines crucial future research directions to enable the safe and effective deployment of foundation models in autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 14 figures, accepted at IEEE Open Journal of Vehicular Technology (OJVT)</p></details> |
| **[RoFt-Mol: Benchmarking Robust Fine-Tuning with Molecular Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00614v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of foundation models, fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific downstream tasks has become crucial. This drives the need for robust fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based, representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment in real-world educational settings is hindered by privacy regulations, data silos, and limited domain-specific data availability. We introduce M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) for education: a paradigm that integrates federated learning (FL) with M3T FMs to enable collaborative, privacy-preserving training across decentralized institutions while accommodating diverse modalities and tasks. Subsequently, this position paper aims to unveil M3T FedFMs as a promising yet underexplored approach to the education community, explore its potentials, and reveal its related future research directions. We outline how M3T FedFMs can advance three critical pillars of next-generation intelligent education systems: (i) privacy preservation, by keeping sensitive multi-modal student and institutional data local; (ii) personalization, through modular architectures enabling tailored models for students, instructors, and institutions; and (iii) equity and inclusivity, by facilitating participation from underrepresented and resource-constrained entities. We finally identify various open research challenges, including studying of (i) inter-institution heterogeneous privacy regulations, (ii) the non-uniformity of data modalities' characteristics, (iii) the unlearning approaches for M3T FedFMs, (iv) the continual learning frameworks for M3T FedFMs, and (v) M3T FedFM model interpretability, which must be collectively addressed for practical deployment.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

However, current beat tracking methods face challenges due to the scarcity of labeled data, which limits their ability to generalize across diverse musical styles and accurately capture complex rhythmic structures. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel beat tracking paradigm BeatFM, which introduces a pre-trained music foundation model and leverages its rich semantic knowledge to improve beat tracking performance. Pre-training on diverse music datasets endows music foundation models with a robust understanding of music, thereby effectively addressing these challenges. To further adapt it for beat tracking, we design a plug-and-play multi-dimensional semantic aggregation module, which is composed of three parallel sub-modules, each focusing on semantic aggregation in the temporal, frequency, and channel domains, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in beat and downbeat tracking across multiple benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early draft for discussion only.

| **[General Demographic Foundation Models for Enhancing Predictive Performance Across Diseases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07330v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often relegated to auxiliary roles in model design, with limited attention has been given to learning their representations. This study proposes a General Demographic Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational representation framework tailored to age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with diverse diseases and population compositions from different geographic regions. The GDP architecture explores combinations of ordering strategies and encoding methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into latent embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that sequential ordering substantially improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification. Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundational models for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and populations, offering a promising direction for improving predictive performance in healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |

This has led to considerable investment in bespoke modeling efforts translating sparse labels into maps. Here we introduce AlphaEarth Foundations, an embedding field model yielding a highly general, geospatial representation that assimilates spatial, temporal, and measurement contexts across multiple sources, enabling accurate and efficient production of maps and monitoring systems from local to global scales. The embeddings generated by AlphaEarth Foundations are the only to consistently outperform a suite of other well-known/widely accepted featurization approaches tested on a diverse set of mapping evaluations without re-training. We have released a dataset of global, annual, analysis-ready embedding field layers from 2017 through 2024.</p></details> |  |
| **[Of Graphs and Tables: Zero-Shot Node Classification with Tabular Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07143v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast, tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns, enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders, applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for scalable and generalizable graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Trained on a diverse set of datasets of initial and boundary conditions paired with corresponding solutions to ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs), ICON learns to map example condition-solution pairs of a given differential equation to an approximation of its solution operator. Here, we present a probabilistic framework that reveals ICON as implicitly performing Bayesian inference, where it computes the mean of the posterior predictive distribution over solution operators conditioned on the provided context, i.e., example condition-solution pairs. The formalism of random differential equations provides the probabilistic framework for describing the tasks ICON accomplishes while also providing a basis for understanding other multi-operator learning methods. This probabilistic perspective provides a basis for extending ICON to \emph{generative} settings, where one can sample from the posterior predictive distribution of solution operators. The generative formulation of ICON (GenICON) captures the underlying uncertainty in the solution operator, which enables principled uncertainty quantification in the solution predictions in operator learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5 million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites, spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat dataset are publicly available online: https://github.com/PheniX-Lab/FoMo4Wheat and https://huggingface.co/PheniX-Lab/FoMo4Wheat.

| **[Leveraging Generic Foundation Models for Multimodal Surgical Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06831v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal setup. In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition. As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings. Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures; accepted at ML-CDS @ MICCAI 2025, Daejeon, Republic of Korea</p></details> |

This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models (FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing 150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging. Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Foundations for Deep Research Systems: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06733v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator, and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback. Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent, off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration, recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence on such human priors and rater biases. This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations of deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii) agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA, VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, first version</p></details> |
| **[MM-DINOv2: Adapting Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06617v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models like DINOv2 demonstrate remarkable potential in medical imaging despite their origin in natural image domains. However, their design inherently works best for uni-modal image analysis, limiting their effectiveness for multi-modal imaging tasks that are common in many medical fields, such as neurology and oncology. While supervised models perform well in this setting, they fail to leverage unlabeled datasets and struggle with missing modalities, a frequent challenge in clinical settings. To bridge these gaps, we introduce MM-DINOv2, a novel and efficient framework that adapts the pre-trained vision foundation model DINOv2 for multi-modal medical imaging. Our approach incorporates multi-modal patch embeddings, enabling vision foundation models to effectively process multi-modal imaging data. To address missing modalities, we employ full-modality masking, which encourages the model to learn robust cross-modality relationships. Furthermore, we leverage semi-supervised learning to harness large unlabeled datasets, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of medical predictions. Applied to glioma subtype classification from multi-sequence brain MRI, our method achieves a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.6 on an external test set, surpassing state-of-the-art supervised approaches by +11.1%. Our work establishes a scalable and robust solution for multi-modal medical imaging tasks, leveraging powerful vision foundation models pre-trained on natural images while addressing real-world clinical challenges such as missing data and limited annotations.</p></details> |  |

However, most GAD methods assume identical training and testing distributions and are tailored to specific tasks, resulting in limited adaptability to real-world scenarios such as shifting data distributions and scarce training samples in new applications. To address the limitations, recent work has focused on improving the generalization capability of GAD models through transfer learning that leverages knowledge from related domains to enhance detection performance, or developing "one-for-all" GAD foundation models that generalize across multiple applications. Since a systematic understanding of generalization in GAD is still lacking, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of generalization in GAD. We first trace the evolution of generalization in GAD and formalize the problem settings, which further leads to our systematic taxonomy. Rooted in this fine-grained taxonomy, an up-to-date and comprehensive review is conducted for the existing generalized GAD methods. Finally, we identify current open challenges and suggest future directions to inspire future research in this emerging field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICKG 2025. 8 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[WindFM: An Open-Source Foundation Model for Zero-Shot Wind Power Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06311v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality wind power forecasting is crucial for the operation of modern power grids. However, prevailing data-driven paradigms either train a site-specific model which cannot generalize to other locations or rely on fine-tuning of general-purpose time series foundation models which are difficult to incorporate domain-specific data in the energy sector. This paper introduces WindFM, a lightweight and generative Foundation Model designed specifically for probabilistic wind power forecasting. WindFM employs a discretize-and-generate framework. A specialized time-series tokenizer first converts continuous multivariate observations into discrete, hierarchical tokens. Subsequently, a decoder-only Transformer learns a universal representation of wind generation dynamics by autoregressively pre-training on these token sequences. Using the comprehensive WIND Toolkit dataset comprising approximately 150 billion time steps from more than 126,000 sites, WindFM develops a foundational understanding of the complex interplay between atmospheric conditions and power output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our compact 8.1M parameter model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on both deterministic and probabilistic tasks, outperforming specialized models and larger foundation models without any fine-tuning. In particular, WindFM exhibits strong adaptiveness under out-of-distribution data from a different continent, demonstrating the robustness and transferability of its learned representations. Our pre-trained model is publicly available at https://github.com/shiyu-coder/WindFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Software Engineering: Foundational Pillars and a Research Roadmap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06216v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Software Engineering (SE 3.0) represents a new era where intelligent agents are tasked not with simple code generation, but with achieving complex, goal-oriented SE objectives. To harness these new capabilities while ensuring trustworthiness, we must recognize a fundamental duality within the SE field in the Agentic SE era, comprising two symbiotic modalities: SE for Humans and SE for Agents. This duality demands a radical reimagining of the foundational pillars of SE (actors, processes, tools, and artifacts) which manifest differently across each modality. We propose two purpose-built workbenches to support this vision. The Agent Command Environment (ACE) serves as a command center where humans orchestrate and mentor agent teams, handling outputs such as Merge-Readiness Packs (MRPs) and Consultation Request Packs (CRPs). The Agent Execution Environment (AEE) is a digital workspace where agents perform tasks while invoking human expertise when facing ambiguity or complex trade-offs. This bi-directional partnership, which supports agent-initiated human callbacks and handovers, gives rise to new, structured engineering activities (i.e., processes) that redefine human-AI collaboration, elevating the practice from agentic coding to true agentic software engineering. This paper presents the Structured Agentic Software Engineering (SASE) vision, outlining several of the foundational pillars for the future of SE. The paper culminates in a research roadmap that identifies a few key challenges and opportunities while briefly discussing the resulting impact of this future on SE education. Our goal is not to offer a definitive solution, but to provide a conceptual scaffold with structured vocabulary to catalyze a community-wide dialogue, pushing the SE community to think beyond its classic, human-centric tenets toward a disciplined, scalable, and trustworthy agentic future.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedSeqFT: Sequential Fine-tuning Foundation Models for 3D Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06096v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies, however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore, evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective, knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving clinical tasks.

However, current foundation models, designed for natural language, fail to grasp the holistic nature of structured interactions found in domains like telecommunications, e-commerce and finance. By serializing events into text, they disassemble them into semantically fragmented parts, losing critical context. In this work, we introduce the Unified Interaction Foundation Model (UIFM), a foundation model engineered for genuine behavioral understanding. At its core is the principle of composite tokenization, where each multi-attribute event is treated as a single, semantically coherent unit. This allows UIFM to learn the underlying "grammar" of user behavior, perceiving entire interactions rather than a disconnected stream of data points. We demonstrate that this architecture is not just more accurate, but represents a fundamental step towards creating more adaptable and intelligent predictive systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compression Beyond Pixels: Semantic Compression with Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05925v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks. These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets, achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at IEEE 35th Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)</p></details> |
| **[time2time: Causal Intervention in Hidden States to Simulate Rare Events in Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05801v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While transformer-based foundation models excel at forecasting routine patterns, two questions remain: do they internalize semantic concepts such as market regimes, or merely fit curves? And can their internal representations be leveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To investigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments of one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period) during the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts: injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm semantics suppresses crashes and restores stability. Beyond binary control, we find that models encode a graded notion of event severity, with the latent vector norm directly correlating with the magnitude of systemic shocks. Validated across two architecturally distinct TSFMs, Toto (decoder only) and Chronos (encoder-decoder), our results demonstrate that steerable, semantically grounded representations are a robust property of large time series transformers. Our findings provide evidence for a latent concept space that governs model predictions, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution to direct causal intervention, and enabling semantic "what-if" analysis for strategic stress-testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Workflow for High-Fidelity Dynamic Analysis of Structures with Pile Foundation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05675v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The demand for high-fidelity numerical simulations in soil-structure interaction analysis is on the rise, yet a standardized workflow to guide the creation of such simulations remains elusive. This paper aims to bridge this gap by presenting a step-by-step guideline proposing a workflow for dynamic analysis of structures with pile foundations. The proposed workflow encompasses instructions on how to use Domain Reduction Method for loading, Perfectly Matched Layer elements for wave absorption, soil-structure interaction modeling using Embedded interface elements, and domain decomposition for efficient use of processing units. Through a series of numerical simulations, we showcase the practical application of this workflow. Our results reveal the efficacy of the Domain Reduction Method in reducing simulation size without compromising model fidelity, show the precision of Perfectly Matched Layer elements in modeling infinite domains, highlight the efficiency of Embedded Interface elements in establishing connections between structures and the soil domain, and demonstrate the overall effectiveness of the proposed workflow in conducting high-fidelity simulations. While our study focuses on simplified geometries and loading scenarios, it serves as a foundational framework for future research endeavors aimed at exploring more intricate structural configurations and dynamic loading conditions</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 20 figures, conference paper, Proceedings of the XVII PCSMGE</p></details> |

Most approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach, effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge, enabling practical and general relighting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yoterel.github.io/PractiLight-project-page/</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Modal Multi-Task (M3T) Federated Foundation Models for Embodied AI: Potentials and Challenges for Edge Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11191v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As embodied AI systems become increasingly multi-modal, personalized, and interactive, they must learn effectively from diverse sensory inputs, adapt continually to user preferences, and operate safely under resource and privacy constraints. These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning models capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model generalization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable candidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: multi-modal multi-task foundation models (M3T-FMs) provide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas federated learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed, privacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization. However, when used in isolation, each of these approaches falls short of meeting the complex and diverse capability requirements of real-world embodied AI environments. In this vision paper, we introduce multi-modal multi-task federated foundation models (M3T-FFMs) for embodied AI, a new paradigm that unifies the strengths of M3T-FMs with the privacy-preserving distributed training nature of FL, enabling intelligent systems at the wireless edge. We collect critical deployment dimensions of M3T-FFMs in embodied AI ecosystems under a unified framework, which we name "EMBODY": Embodiment heterogeneity, Modality richness and imbalance, Bandwidth and compute constraints, On-device continual learning, Distributed control and autonomy, and Yielding safety, privacy, and personalization. For each, we identify concrete challenges and envision actionable research directions. We also present an evaluation framework for deploying M3T-FFMs in embodied AI systems, along with the associated trade-offs. Finally, we present a prototype implementation of M3T-FFMs and evaluate their energy and latency performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in IEEE Internet of Things Magazine, 2025</p></details> |

| **[Foundational Models and Federated Learning: Survey, Taxonomy, Challenges and Practical Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05142v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning has the potential to unlock siloed data and distributed resources by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private data. As more complex foundational models gain widespread use, the need to expand training resources and integrate privately owned data grows as well. In this article, we explore the intersection of federated learning and foundational models, aiming to identify, categorize, and characterize technical methods that integrate the two paradigms. As a unified survey is currently unavailable, we present a literature survey structured around a novel taxonomy that follows the development life-cycle stages, along with a technical comparison of available methods. Additionally, we provide practical insights and guidelines for implementing and evolving these methods, with a specific focus on the healthcare domain as a case study, where the potential impact of federated learning and foundational models is considered significant. Our survey covers multiple intersecting topics, including but not limited to federated learning, self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, distillation, and transfer learning. Initially, we retrieved and reviewed a set of over 4,200 articles. This collection was narrowed to more than 250 thoroughly reviewed articles through inclusion criteria, featuring 42 unique methods. The methods were used to construct the taxonomy and enabled their comparison based on complexity, efficiency, and scalability. We present these results as a self-contained overview that not only summarizes the state of the field but also provides insights into the practical aspects of adopting, evolving, and integrating foundational models with federated learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[CEHR-XGPT: A Scalable Multi-Task Foundation Model for Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03643v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a rich, longitudinal view of patient health and hold significant potential for advancing clinical decision support, risk prediction, and data-driven healthcare research. However, most artificial intelligence (AI) models for EHRs are designed for narrow, single-purpose tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world settings. Here, we present CEHR-XGPT, a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that unifies three essential capabilities - feature representation, zero-shot prediction, and synthetic data generation - within a single architecture. To support temporal reasoning over clinical sequences, CEHR-XGPT incorporates a novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients' dynamic timelines into the model structure. CEHR-XGPT demonstrates strong performance across all three tasks and generalizes effectively to external datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning. Its versatility enables rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting without the need for task-specific retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Video-to-Audio Generation via Multiple Foundation Models Mapper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04957v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming, requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[FloodVision: Urban Flood Depth Estimation Using Foundation Vision-Language Models and Domain Knowledge Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04772v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart city flood resilience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradient Methods with Online Scaling Part I. Theoretical Foundations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23081v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper establishes the theoretical foundations of the online scaled gradient methods (OSGM), a framework that utilizes online learning to adapt stepsizes and provably accelerate first-order methods. OSGM quantifies the effectiveness of a stepsize by a feedback function motivated from a convergence measure and uses the feedback to adjust the stepsize through an online learning algorithm. Consequently, instantiations of OSGM achieve convergence rates that are asymptotically no worse than the optimal stepsize. OSGM yields desirable convergence guarantees on smooth convex problems, including 1) trajectory-dependent global convergence on smooth convex objectives; 2) an improved complexity result on smooth strongly convex problems, and 3) local superlinear convergence. Notably, OSGM constitutes a new family of first-order methods with non-asymptotic superlinear convergence, joining the celebrated quasi-Newton methods. Finally, OSGM explains the empirical success of the popular hypergradient-descent heuristic in optimization for machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extension of arXiv:2411.01803 and arXiv:2502.11229</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Foundation Model-Driven User Interest Modeling and Behavior Analysis on Short Video Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04751v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid expansion of user bases on short video platforms, personalized recommendation systems are playing an increasingly critical role in enhancing user experience and optimizing content distribution. Traditional interest modeling methods often rely on unimodal data, such as click logs or text labels, which limits their ability to fully capture user preferences in a complex multimodal content environment. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a multimodal foundation model-based framework for user interest modeling and behavior analysis. By integrating video frames, textual descriptions, and background music into a unified semantic space using cross-modal alignment strategies, the framework constructs fine-grained user interest vectors. Additionally, we introduce a behavior-driven feature embedding mechanism that incorporates viewing, liking, and commenting sequences to model dynamic interest evolution, thereby improving both the timeliness and accuracy of recommendations. In the experimental phase, we conduct extensive evaluations using both public and proprietary short video datasets, comparing our approach against multiple mainstream recommendation algorithms and modeling techniques. Results demonstrate significant improvements in behavior prediction accuracy, interest modeling for cold-start users, and recommendation click-through rates. Moreover, we incorporate interpretability mechanisms using attention weights and feature visualization to reveal the model's decision basis under multimodal inputs and trace interest shifts, thereby enhancing the transparency and controllability of the recommendation system.</p></details> |  |
| **[ALF: Advertiser Large Foundation Model for Multi-Modal Advertiser Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18785v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ALF (Advertiser Large Foundation model), a multi-modal transformer architecture for understanding advertiser behavior and intent across text, image, video, and structured data modalities. Through contrastive learning and multi-task optimization, ALF creates unified advertiser representations that capture both content and behavioral patterns. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on critical tasks including fraud detection, policy violation identification, and advertiser similarity matching. In production deployment, ALF demonstrates significant real-world impact by delivering simultaneous gains in both precision and recall, for instance boosting recall by over 40 percentage points on one critical policy and increasing precision to 99.8% on another. The architecture's effectiveness stems from its novel combination of multi-modal transformations, inter-sample attention mechanism, spectrally normalized projections, and calibrated probabilistic outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reasoning for PDE Foundation Models: A Reward-Model-Driven Inference-Time-Scaling Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02846v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking" strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational workflows in physics and engineering.</p></details> |  |

However, transformer-based foundation models in other domains have reduced data requirements by leveraging pre-trained generalist models. Ultimately, developing zero-shot foundation models of system dynamics could drastically reduce manual deployment effort. While recent work shows that transformer-based end-to-end approaches can achieve zero-shot performance on unseen systems, they are limited to sensor models seen during training. We introduce the foundation model unscented Kalman filter (FM-UKF), which combines a transformer-based model of system dynamics with analytically known sensor models via an UKF, enabling generalization across varying dynamics without retraining for new sensor configurations. We evaluate FM-UKF on a new benchmark of container ship models with complex dynamics, demonstrating a competitive accuracy, effort, and robustness trade-off compared to classical methods with approximate system knowledge and to an end-to-end approach. The benchmark and dataset are open sourced to further support future research in zero-shot state estimation via foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at CDC2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches either focus on general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation, and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extreme and general weather forecasting, showcasing superior adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 80 figures, submitted to ACM KDD 2026 conference</p></details> |
| **[Beyond holography: the entropic quantum gravity foundations of image processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14048v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is increasing scientific attention in establishing the connections between theoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has formulated the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) approach to quantum gravity in which gravity is derived from the geometric quantum relative entropy (GQRE) between two metrics associated with the Lorentzian spacetime. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow of the GfE action in its simple warm-up scenario. Specifically, this algorithm is the outcome of the minimization of the GQRE between two Euclidean metrics: the one of the support of the image and the one induced by the image. As the Perona-Malik algorithm is known to preserve sharp contours, this implies that the GfE action, does not in general lead to uniform images upon iteration of the gradient flow dynamics as it would be intuitively expected from entropic actions maximising classical entropies. Rather, the outcome of the minimization of the GQRE is compatible with the preservation of complex structures. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and might contribute to establish deeper connections between GfE, machine learning and brain research.</p></details> | (7 pages, 1 figure) |

The analysis begins with foundational architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks. Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new paradigm by applying the Transformer architecture to sequences of image patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale image recognition. Building on these visual representation backbones, we investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher, yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective method for pre-training large-scale vision models.</p></details> |  |

In ophthalmology, RETFound, a retina-specific FM pre-trained sequentially on 1.4 million natural images and 1.6 million retinal images, has demonstrated high adaptability across clinical applications. Conversely, DINOv2, a general-purpose vision FM pre-trained on 142 million natural images, has shown promise in non-medical domains. However, its applicability to clinical tasks remains underexplored. To address this, we conducted head-to-head evaluations by fine-tuning RETFound and three DINOv2 models (large, base, small) for ocular disease detection and systemic disease prediction tasks, across eight standardized open-source ocular datasets, as well as the Moorfields AlzEye and the UK Biobank datasets. DINOv2-large model outperformed RETFound in detecting diabetic retinopathy (AUROC=0.850-0.952 vs 0.823-0.944, across three datasets, all P<=0.007) and multi-class eye diseases (AUROC=0.892 vs. 0.846, P<0.001). In glaucoma, DINOv2-base model outperformed RETFound (AUROC=0.958 vs 0.940, P<0.001). Conversely, RETFound achieved superior performance over all DINOv2 models in predicting heart failure, myocardial infarction, and ischaemic stroke (AUROC=0.732-0.796 vs 0.663-0.771, all P<0.001). These trends persisted even with 10% of the fine-tuning data. These findings showcase the distinct scenarios where general-purpose and domain-specific FMs excel, highlighting the importance of aligning FM selection with task-specific requirements to optimise clinical performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Ophthalmology Science and is currently in press</p></details> |
| **[A Foundation Model for Chest X-ray Interpretation with Grounded Reasoning via Online Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03906v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical foundation models (FMs) have shown tremendous promise amid the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, current medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities, then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent) tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR interpretation.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Substantial technical advances have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finetuning AI Foundation Models to Develop Subgrid-Scale Parameterizations: A Case Study on Atmospheric Gravity Waves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03816v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global climate models parameterize a range of atmospheric-oceanic processes like gravity waves, clouds, moist convection, and turbulence that cannot be sufficiently resolved. These subgrid-scale closures for unresolved processes are a leading source of model uncertainty. Here, we present a new approach to developing machine learning parameterizations of small-scale climate processes by fine-tuning a pre-trained AI foundation model (FM). FMs are largely unexplored in climate research. A pre-trained encoder-decoder from a 2.3 billion parameter FM (NASA and IBM Research's Prithvi WxC) -- which contains a latent probabilistic representation of atmospheric evolution -- is fine-tuned (or reused) to create a deep learning parameterization for atmospheric gravity waves (GWs). The parameterization captures GW effects for a coarse-resolution climate model by learning the fluxes from an atmospheric reanalysis with 10 times finer resolution. A comparison of monthly averages and instantaneous evolution with a machine learning model baseline (an Attention U-Net) reveals superior predictive performance of the FM parameterization throughout the atmosphere, even in regions excluded from pre-training. This performance boost is quantified using the Hellinger distance, which is 0.11 for the baseline and 0.06 for the fine-tuned model. Our findings emphasize the versatility and reusability of FMs, which could be used to accomplish a range of atmosphere- and climate-related applications, leading the way for the creation of observations-driven and physically accurate parameterizations for more earth-system processes.</p></details> |  |

Here, we leveraged Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs) pre-trained on large histopathology datasets and applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning via low-rank adaptation. In addition, we incorporated ConvNeXt V2, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture, to complement PFMs. During training, we employed a fisheye transform to emphasize mitoses and Fourier Domain Adaptation using ImageNet target images. Finally, we ensembled multiple PFMs to integrate complementary morphological insights, achieving competitive balanced accuracy on the Preliminary Evaluation Phase dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Embeddings to Accuracy: Comparing Foundation Models for Radiographic Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10823v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models provide robust embeddings for diverse tasks, including medical imaging. We evaluate embeddings from seven general and medical-specific foundation models (e.g., DenseNet121, BiomedCLIP, MedImageInsight, Rad-DINO, CXR-Foundation) for training lightweight adapters in multi-class radiography classification. Using a dataset of 8,842 radiographs across seven classes, we trained adapters with algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors, logistic regression, SVM, random forest, and MLP. The combination of MedImageInsight embeddings with an SVM or MLP adapter achieved the highest mean area under the curve (mAUC) of 93.1%. This performance was statistically superior to other models, including MedSigLIP with an MLP (91.0%), Rad-DINO with an SVM (90.7%), and CXR-Foundation with logistic regression (88.6%). In contrast, models like BiomedCLIP (82.8%) and Med-Flamingo (78.5%) showed lower performance. Crucially, these lightweight adapters are computationally efficient, training in minutes and performing inference in seconds on a CPU, making them practical for clinical use. A fairness analysis of the top-performing MedImageInsight adapter revealed minimal performance disparities across patient gender (within 1.8%) and age groups (std. dev < 1.4%), with no significant statistical differences. These findings confirm that embeddings from specialized foundation models, particularly MedImageInsight, can power accurate, efficient, and equitable diagnostic tools using simple, lightweight adapters.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Federated Foundation Models over Wireless Networks for Multi-Modal Multi-Task Intelligence: Integration of Edge Learning with D2D/P2P-Enabled Fog Learning Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03695v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of foundation models (FMs) has reshaped the landscape of machine learning. As these models continued to grow, leveraging geo-distributed data from wireless devices has become increasingly critical, giving rise to federated foundation models (FFMs). More recently, FMs have evolved into multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs (e.g., GPT-4) capable of processing diverse modalities across multiple tasks, which motivates a new underexplored paradigm: M3T FFMs. In this paper, we unveil an unexplored variation of M3T FFMs by proposing hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), which in turn expose two overlooked heterogeneity dimensions to fog/edge networks that have a direct impact on these emerging models: (i) heterogeneity in collected modalities and (ii) heterogeneity in executed tasks across fog/edge nodes. HF-FMs strategically align the modular structure of M3T FMs, comprising modality encoders, prompts, mixture-of-experts (MoEs), adapters, and task heads, with the hierarchical nature of fog/edge infrastructures. Moreover, HF-FMs enable the optional usage of device-to-device (D2D) communications, enabling horizontal module relaying and localized cooperative training among nodes when feasible. Through delving into the architectural design of HF-FMs, we highlight their unique capabilities along with a series of tailored future research directions. Finally, to demonstrate their potential, we prototype HF-FMs in a wireless network setting and release the open-source code for the development of HF-FMs with the goal of fostering exploration in this untapped field (GitHub: https://github.com/payamsiabd/M3T-FFM).</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[SafeProtein: Red-Teaming Framework and Benchmark for Protein Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03487v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/jigang-fan/SafeProtein.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Foundations of Tuning without Forgetting in Neural ODEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03474v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In our earlier work, we introduced the principle of Tuning without Forgetting (TwF) for sequential training of neural ODEs, where training samples are added iteratively and parameters are updated within the subspace of control functions that preserves the end-point mapping at previously learned samples on the manifold of output labels in the first-order approximation sense. In this letter, we prove that this parameter subspace forms a Banach submanifold of finite codimension under nonsingular controls, and we characterize its tangent space. This reveals that TwF corresponds to a continuation/deformation of the control function along the tangent space of this Banach submanifold, providing a theoretical foundation for its mapping-preserving (not forgetting) during the sequential training exactly, beyond first-order approximation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalist versus Specialist Vision Foundation Models for Ocular Disease and Oculomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03421v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical foundation models, pre-trained with large-scale clinical data, demonstrate strong performance in diverse clinically relevant applications. RETFound, trained on nearly one million retinal images, exemplifies this approach in applications with retinal images. However, the emergence of increasingly powerful and multifold larger generalist foundation models such as DINOv2 and DINOv3 raises the question of whether domain-specific pre-training remains essential, and if so, what gap persists. To investigate this, we systematically evaluated the adaptability of DINOv2 and DINOv3 in retinal image applications, compared to two specialist RETFound models, RETFound-MAE and RETFound-DINOv2. We assessed performance on ocular disease detection and systemic disease prediction using two adaptation strategies: fine-tuning and linear probing. Data efficiency and adaptation efficiency were further analysed to characterise trade-offs between predictive performance and computational cost. Our results show that although scaling generalist models yields strong adaptability across diverse tasks, RETFound-DINOv2 consistently outperforms these generalist foundation models in ocular-disease detection and oculomics tasks, demonstrating stronger generalisability and data efficiency. These findings suggest that specialist retinal foundation models remain the most effective choice for clinical applications, while the narrowing gap with generalist foundation models suggests that continued data and model scaling can deliver domain-relevant gains and position them as strong foundations for future medical foundation models.</p></details> | 39 pages, 8 Figures |
| **[FoMEMO: Towards Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03244v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expensive multi-objective optimization is a prevalent and crucial concern in many real-world scenarios, where sample-efficiency is vital due to the limited evaluations to recover the true Pareto front for decision making. Existing works either involve rebuilding Gaussian process surrogates from scratch for each objective in each new problem encountered, or rely on extensive past domain experiments for pre-training deep learning models, making them hard to generalize and impractical to cope with various emerging applications in the real world. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm named FoMEMO (Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization), which enables the establishment of a foundation model conditioned on any domain trajectory and user preference, and facilitates fast in-context optimization based on the predicted preference-wise aggregation posteriors. Rather than accessing extensive domain experiments in the real world, we demonstrate that pre-training the foundation model with a diverse set of hundreds of millions of synthetic data can lead to superior adaptability to unknown problems, without necessitating any subsequent model training or updates in the optimization process. We evaluate our method across a variety of synthetic benchmarks and real-word applications, and demonstrate its superior generality and competitive performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
