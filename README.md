| **[Self-Supervised Spatial Correspondence Across Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03148v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method for finding cross-modal space-time correspondences. Given two images from different visual modalities, such as an RGB image and a depth map, our model identifies which pairs of pixels correspond to the same physical points in the scene. To solve this problem, we extend the contrastive random walk framework to simultaneously learn cycle-consistent feature representations for both cross-modal and intra-modal matching. The resulting model is simple and has no explicit photo-consistency assumptions. It can be trained entirely using unlabeled data, without the need for any spatially aligned multimodal image pairs. We evaluate our method on both geometric and semantic correspondence tasks. For geometric matching, we consider challenging tasks such as RGB-to-depth and RGB-to-thermal matching (and vice versa); for semantic matching, we evaluate on photo-sketch and cross-style image alignment. Our method achieves strong performance across all benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025. Project link: https://www.ayshrv.com/cmrw .

| **[OmniSpatial: Towards Comprehensive Spatial Reasoning Benchmark for Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03135v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning is a key aspect of cognitive psychology and remains a major bottleneck for current vision-language models (VLMs). While extensive research has aimed to evaluate or improve VLMs' understanding of basic spatial relations, such as distinguishing left from right, near from far, and object counting, these tasks represent only the most fundamental level of spatial reasoning. In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology. OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained subcategories. Through Internet data crawling and careful manual annotation, we construct over 1.5K question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments show that both open- and closed-source VLMs, as well as existing reasoning and spatial understanding models, exhibit significant limitations in comprehensive spatial understanding. We further analyze failure cases and propose potential directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://qizekun.github.io/omnispatial/</p></details> |
| **[SASP: Strip-Aware Spatial Perception for Fine-Grained Bird Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24380v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained bird image classification (FBIC) is not only of great significance for ecological monitoring and species identification, but also holds broad research value in the fields of image recognition and fine-grained visual modeling. Compared with general image classification tasks, FBIC poses more formidable challenges: 1) the differences in species size and imaging distance result in the varying sizes of birds presented in the images; 2) complex natural habitats often introduce strong background interference; 3) and highly flexible poses such as flying, perching, or foraging result in substantial intra-class variability. These factors collectively make it difficult for traditional methods to stably extract discriminative features, thereby limiting the generalizability and interpretability of models in real-world applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a fine-grained bird classification framework based on strip-aware spatial perception, which aims to capture long-range spatial dependencies across entire rows or columns in bird images, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and interpretability. The proposed method incorporates two novel modules: extensional perception aggregator (EPA) and channel semantic weaving (CSW). Specifically, EPA integrates local texture details with global structural cues by aggregating information across horizontal and vertical spatial directions. CSW further refines the semantic representations by adaptively fusing long-range and short-range information along the channel dimension. Built upon a ResNet-50 backbone, the model enables jump-wise connection of extended structural features across the spatial domain. Experimental results on the CUB-200-2011 dataset demonstrate that our framework achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining architectural efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Correlated Nugget Effects in Multivariate Spatial Models: An Application to Argo Ocean Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03042v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate analysis of global oceanographic data, such as temperature and salinity profiles from the Argo program, requires geostatistical models capable of capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study introduces Gaussian and non-Gaussian hierarchical multivariate Mat\'ern-SPDE models with correlated nugget effects to account for small-scale variability and measurement error correlations. Using simulations and Argo data, we demonstrate that incorporating correlated nugget effects significantly improves the accuracy of parameter estimation and spatial prediction in both Gaussian and non-Gaussian multivariate spatial processes. When applied to global ocean temperature and salinity data, our model yields lower correlation estimates between fields compared to models that assume independent noise. This suggests that traditional models may overestimate the underlying field correlation. By separating these effects, our approach captures fine-scale oceanic patterns more effectively. These findings show the importance of relaxing the assumption of independent measurement errors in multivariate hierarchical models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linear Spatial World Models Emerge in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02996v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent abilities across diverse tasks, raising the question of whether they acquire internal world models. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs implicitly encode linear spatial world models, which we define as linear representations of physical space and object configurations. We introduce a formal framework for spatial world models and assess whether such structure emerges in contextual embeddings. Using a synthetic dataset of object positions, we train probes to decode object positions and evaluate geometric consistency of the underlying space. We further conduct causal interventions to test whether these spatial representations are functionally used by the model. Our results provide empirical evidence that LLMs encode linear spatial world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially Correlated multi-RIS Communication: The Effect of Inter-Operator Interference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02666v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A multi-operator wireless communication system is studied where each operator is equipped with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to enhance its communication quality. RISs controlled by different operators affect the system performance of one another due to the inherently rapid phase shift adjustments that occur on an independent basis. The system performance of such a communication scenario is analytically studied for the practical case where spatial correlation occurs at RIS of arbitrary size. The proposed framework is quite general since it is analyzed under Nakagami-$m$ channel fading conditions. Finally, the derived analytical results are verified via numerical and simulation trials as well as some new and useful engineering outcomes are revealed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Journal. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.00349</p></details> |
| **[Scaling and Beyond: Advancing Spatial Reasoning in MLLMs Requires New Recipes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15037v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in general vision-language tasks. However, recent studies have exposed critical limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities. This deficiency in spatial reasoning significantly constrains MLLMs' ability to interact effectively with the physical world, thereby limiting their broader applications. We argue that spatial reasoning capabilities will not naturally emerge from merely scaling existing architectures and training methodologies. Instead, this challenge demands dedicated attention to fundamental modifications in the current MLLM development approach. In this position paper, we first establish a comprehensive framework for spatial reasoning within the context of MLLMs. We then elaborate on its pivotal role in real-world applications. Through systematic analysis, we examine how individual components of the current methodology, from training data to reasoning mechanisms, influence spatial reasoning capabilities. This examination reveals critical limitations while simultaneously identifying promising avenues for advancement. Our work aims to direct the AI research community's attention toward these crucial yet underexplored aspects. By highlighting these challenges and opportunities, we seek to catalyze progress toward achieving human-like spatial reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniAudio: Generating Spatial Audio from 360-Degree Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14906v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional video-to-audio generation techniques primarily focus on perspective video and non-spatial audio, often missing the spatial cues necessary for accurately representing sound sources in 3D environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel task, 360V2SA, to generate spatial audio from 360-degree videos, specifically producing First-order Ambisonics (FOA) audio - a standard format for representing 3D spatial audio that captures sound directionality and enables realistic 3D audio reproduction. We first create Sphere360, a novel dataset tailored for this task that is curated from real-world data. We also design an efficient semi-automated pipeline for collecting and cleaning paired video-audio data. To generate spatial audio from 360-degree video, we propose a novel framework OmniAudio, which leverages self-supervised pre-training using both spatial audio data (in FOA format) and large-scale non-spatial data. Furthermore, OmniAudio features a dual-branch framework that utilizes both panoramic and perspective video inputs to capture comprehensive local and global information from 360-degree videos. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective metrics on Sphere360. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/liuhuadai/OmniAudio. The project website is available at https://OmniAudio-360V2SA.github.io.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Spatial Coordinates as a Cell Language: A Multi-Sentence Framework for Imaging Mass Cytometry Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01918v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image mass cytometry (IMC) enables high-dimensional spatial profiling by combining mass cytometry's analytical power with spatial distributions of cell phenotypes. Recent studies leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract cell states by translating gene or protein expression into biological context. However, existing single-cell LLMs face two major challenges: (1) Integration of spatial information: they struggle to generalize spatial coordinates and effectively encode spatial context as text, and (2) Treating each cell independently: they overlook cell-cell interactions, limiting their ability to capture biological relationships. To address these limitations, we propose Spatial2Sentence, a novel framework that integrates single-cell expression and spatial information into natural language using a multi-sentence approach. Spatial2Sentence constructs expression similarity and distance matrices, pairing spatially adjacent and expressionally similar cells as positive pairs while using distant and dissimilar cells as negatives. These multi-sentence representations enable LLMs to learn cellular interactions in both expression and spatial contexts. Equipped with multi-task learning, Spatial2Sentence outperforms existing single-cell LLMs on preprocessed IMC datasets, improving cell-type classification by 5.98% and clinical status prediction by 4.18% on the diabetes dataset while enhancing interpretability.

| **[SpatialLLM: A Compound 3D-Informed Design towards Spatially-Intelligent Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00788v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally understand 3D spatial relationships, enabling complex reasoning like predicting collisions of vehicles from different directions. Current large multimodal models (LMMs), however, lack of this capability of 3D spatial reasoning. This limitation stems from the scarcity of 3D training data and the bias in current model designs toward 2D data. In this paper, we systematically study the impact of 3D-informed data, architecture, and training setups, introducing SpatialLLM, a large multi-modal model with advanced 3D spatial reasoning abilities. To address data limitations, we develop two types of 3D-informed training datasets: (1) 3D-informed probing data focused on object's 3D location and orientation, and (2) 3D-informed conversation data for complex spatial relationships. Notably, we are the first to curate VQA data that incorporate 3D orientation relationships on real images. Furthermore, we systematically integrate these two types of training data with the architectural and training designs of LMMs, providing a roadmap for optimal design aimed at achieving superior 3D reasoning capabilities. Our SpatialLLM advances machines toward highly capable 3D-informed reasoning, surpassing GPT-4o performance by 8.7%. Our systematic empirical design and the resulting findings offer valuable insights for future research in this direction.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 highlight |

The growing scale and dimensional complexity of these datasets demand reproducible, comprehensive and user-friendly computational tools. To address this need, we developed SPAC (SPAtial single-Cell analysis), a Python-based package and a corresponding shiny application within an integrated, modular SPAC ecosystem (Liu et al., 2025) designed specifically for biologists without extensive coding expertise. Following image segmentation and extraction of spatially resolved single-cell data, SPAC streamlines downstream phenotyping and spatial analysis, facilitating characterization of cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization within tissues. Through scalable performance, specialized spatial statistics, highly customizable visualizations, and seamless workflows from dataset to insights, SPAC significantly lowers barriers to sophisticated spatial analyses.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure; pre-print submitted to the *Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)*</p></details> |
| **[LEGO-Puzzles: How Good Are MLLMs at Multi-Step Spatial Reasoning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19990v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-step spatial reasoning entails understanding and reasoning about spatial relationships across multiple sequential steps, which is crucial for tackling complex real-world applications, such as robotic manipulation, autonomous navigation, and automated assembly. To assess how well current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have acquired this fundamental capability, we introduce LEGO-Puzzles, a scalable benchmark designed to evaluate both spatial understanding and sequential reasoning in MLLMs through LEGO-based tasks. LEGO-Puzzles consists of 1,100 carefully curated visual question-answering (VQA) samples spanning 11 distinct tasks, ranging from basic spatial understanding to complex multi-step reasoning. Based on LEGO-Puzzles, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs and uncover significant limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities: even the most powerful MLLMs can answer only about half of the test cases, whereas human participants achieve over 90% accuracy. Furthermore, based on LEGO-Puzzles, we design generation tasks to investigate whether MLLMs can transfer their spatial understanding and reasoning abilities to image generation. Our experiments show that only GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash exhibit a limited ability to follow these instructions, while other MLLMs either replicate the input image or generate completely irrelevant outputs. Overall, LEGO-Puzzles exposes critical deficiencies in existing MLLMs' spatial understanding and sequential reasoning capabilities, and underscores the need for further advancements in multimodal spatial reasoning.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[SVQA-R1: Reinforcing Spatial Reasoning in MLLMs via View-Consistent Reward Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01371v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning remains a critical yet underdeveloped capability in existing vision-language models (VLMs), especially for Spatial Visual Question Answering (Spatial VQA) tasks that require understanding relative positions, distances, and object configurations. Inspired by the R1 paradigm introduced in DeepSeek-R1, which enhances reasoning in language models through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we propose SVQA-R1, the first framework to extend R1-style training to spatial VQA. In particular, we introduce Spatial-GRPO, a novel group-wise RL strategy that constructs view-consistent rewards by perturbing spatial relations between objects, e.g., mirror flipping, thereby encouraging the model to develop a consistent and grounded understanding of space. Our model, SVQA-R1, not only achieves dramatically improved accuracy on spatial VQA benchmarks but also exhibits interpretable reasoning paths even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data. Extensive experiments and visualization demonstrate the effectiveness of SVQA-R1 across multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[STSA: Federated Class-Incremental Learning via Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01327v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) enables Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) from distributed data. Existing FCIL methods typically integrate old knowledge preservation into local client training. However, these methods cannot avoid spatial-temporal client drift caused by data heterogeneity and often incur significant computational and communication overhead, limiting practical deployment. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a novel approach, Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation (STSA), which provides a unified framework to aggregate feature statistics both spatially (across clients) and temporally (across stages). The aggregated feature statistics are unaffected by data heterogeneity and can be used to update the classifier in closed form at each stage. Additionally, we introduce STSA-E, a communication-efficient variant with theoretical guarantees, achieving similar performance to STSA-E with much lower communication overhead. Extensive experiments on three widely used FCIL datasets, with varying degrees of data heterogeneity, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FCIL methods in terms of performance, flexibility, and both communication and computation efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProjMC$^2$: Scalable and Stable Posterior Inference for Bayesian Spatial Factor Models with Application to Spatial Transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01098v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Factor models exhibit a fundamental tradeoff among flexibility, identifiability, and computational efficiency. Bayesian spatial factor models, in particular, face pronounced identifiability concerns and scaling difficulties. To mitigate these issues and enhance posterior inference reliability, this work proposes Projected Markov Chain Monte Carlo (ProjMC$^2$), a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm employing projection techniques and conditional conjugacy. ProjMC$^2$ is showcased within the context of spatial factor analysis, significantly improving posterior stability and MCMC mixing efficiency by projecting posterior sampling of latent factors onto a subspace of a scaled Stiefel manifold. Theoretical results establish convergence to the stationary distribution irrespective of initial values. Integrating this approach with scalable univariate spatial modeling strategies yields a stable, efficient, and flexible modeling and sampling methodology for large-scale spatial factor models. Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and practical advantages of the proposed methods. The practical utility of the methodology is further illustrated through an analysis of spatial transcriptomic data obtained from human kidney tissues, showcasing its potential for enhancing the interpretability and robustness of spatial transcriptomics analyses.</p></details> | 32 pages, 5 figures |
| **[LLaVA-ST: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Fine-Grained Spatial-Temporal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08282v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising results, yet existing approaches struggle to effectively handle both temporal and spatial localization simultaneously. This challenge stems from two key issues: first, incorporating spatial-temporal localization introduces a vast number of coordinate combinations, complicating the alignment of linguistic and visual coordinate representations; second, encoding fine-grained temporal and spatial information during video feature compression is inherently difficult. To address these issues, we propose LLaVA-ST, a MLLM for fine-grained spatial-temporal multimodal understanding. In LLaVA-ST, we propose Language-Aligned Positional Embedding, which embeds the textual coordinate special token into the visual space, simplifying the alignment of fine-grained spatial-temporal correspondences. Additionally, we design the Spatial-Temporal Packer, which decouples the feature compression of temporal and spatial resolutions into two distinct point-to-region attention processing streams. Furthermore, we propose ST-Align dataset with 4.3M training samples for fine-grained spatial-temporal multimodal understanding. With ST-align, we present a progressive training pipeline that aligns the visual and textual feature through sequential coarse-to-fine stages.Additionally, we introduce an ST-Align benchmark to evaluate spatial-temporal interleaved fine-grained understanding tasks, which include Spatial-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) , Event Localization and Captioning (ELC) and Spatial Video Grounding (SVG). LLaVA-ST achieves outstanding performance on 11 benchmarks requiring fine-grained temporal, spatial, or spatial-temporal interleaving multimodal understanding. Our code, data and benchmark will be released at Our code, data and benchmark will be released at https://github.com/appletea233/LLaVA-ST .</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

In this work, we aim to develop a novel 4D convolution network to extract 4D joint temporal-spatial kernels that not only learn spatial information but in addition also capture temporal dynamics. Experimental results show promising performance in capturing spatial-temporal data in functional MRI compared to 3D models. The 4D CNN model improves Alzheimers disease diagnosis for rs-fMRI data, enabling earlier detection and better interventions. Future research could explore task-based fMRI applications and regression tasks, enhancing understanding of cognitive performance and disease progression.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) 2025 under submission number 3398</p></details> |
| **[In-the-wild Audio Spatialization with Flexible Text-guided Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00927v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enhance immersive experiences, binaural audio offers spatial awareness of sounding objects in AR, VR, and embodied AI applications. While existing audio spatialization methods can generally map any available monaural audio to binaural audio signals, they often lack the flexible and interactive control needed in complex multi-object user-interactive environments. To address this, we propose a Text-guided Audio Spatialization (TAS) framework that utilizes flexible text prompts and evaluates our model from unified generation and comprehension perspectives. Due to the limited availability of premium and large-scale stereo data, we construct the SpatialTAS dataset, which encompasses 376,000 simulated binaural audio samples to facilitate the training of our model. Our model learns binaural differences guided by 3D spatial location and relative position prompts, augmented by flipped-channel audio. It outperforms existing methods on both simulated and real-recorded datasets, demonstrating superior generalization and accuracy. Besides, we develop an assessment model based on Llama-3.1-8B, which evaluates the spatial semantic coherence between our generated binaural audio and text prompts through a spatial reasoning task. Results demonstrate that text prompts provide flexible and interactive control to generate binaural audio with excellent quality and semantic consistency in spatial locations.

| **[FreeInsert: Disentangled Text-Guided Object Insertion in 3D Gaussian Scene without Spatial Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01322v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven object insertion in 3D scenes is an emerging task that enables intuitive scene editing through natural language. However, existing 2D editing-based methods often rely on spatial priors such as 2D masks or 3D bounding boxes, and they struggle to ensure consistency of the inserted object. These limitations hinder flexibility and scalability in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose FreeInsert, a novel framework that leverages foundation models including MLLMs, LGMs, and diffusion models to disentangle object generation from spatial placement. This enables unsupervised and flexible object insertion in 3D scenes without spatial priors. FreeInsert starts with an MLLM-based parser that extracts structured semantics, including object types, spatial relationships, and attachment regions, from user instructions. These semantics guide both the reconstruction of the inserted object for 3D consistency and the learning of its degrees of freedom. We leverage the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to initialize object pose and scale. A hierarchical, spatially aware refinement stage further integrates spatial semantics and MLLM-inferred priors to enhance placement. Finally, the appearance of the object is improved using the inserted-object image to enhance visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that FreeInsert achieves semantically coherent, spatially precise, and visually realistic 3D insertions without relying on spatial priors, offering a user-friendly and flexible editing experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Modeling of Spatial Contiguity Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12608v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing has demonstrated potential for solving complex optimization problems; however, its application to spatial regionalization remains underexplored. Spatial contiguity, a fundamental constraint requiring spatial entities to form connected components, significantly increases the complexity of regionalization problems, which are typically challenging for quantum modeling. This paper proposes novel quantum formulations based on a flow model that enforces spatial contiguity constraints. Our scale-aware approach employs a Discrete Quadratic Model (DQM), solvable directly on quantum annealing hardware for small-scale datasets. In addition, it designs a hybrid quantum-classical approach to manage larger-scale problems within existing hardware limitations. This work establishes a foundational framework for integrating quantum methods into practical spatial optimization tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Inference for Spatial-Temporal Non-Gaussian Data Using Predictive Stacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04655v3)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analysing non-Gaussian spatial-temporal data requires introducing spatial dependence in generalised linear models through the link function of an exponential family distribution. Unlike in Gaussian likelihoods, inference is considerably encumbered by the inability to analytically integrate out the random effects and reduce the dimension of the parameter space. Iterative estimation algorithms struggle to converge due to the presence of weakly identified parameters. We devise Bayesian inference using predictive stacking that assimilates inference from analytically tractable conditional posterior distributions. We achieve this by expanding upon the Diaconis-Ylvisaker family of conjugate priors and exploiting generalised conjugate multivariate (GCM) distribution theory for exponential families, which enables exact sampling from analytically available posterior distributions conditional upon some process parameters. Subsequently, we assimilate inference over a range of values of these parameters using Bayesian predictive stacking. We evaluate inferential performance on simulated data, compare with full Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and apply our method to analyse spatially-temporally referenced avian count data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey database.</p></details> | 37 pages, 8 figures |
| **[CityGPT: Empowering Urban Spatial Cognition of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13948v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models(LLMs), with their powerful language generation and reasoning capabilities, have already achieved notable success in many domains, e.g., math and code generation. However, they often fall short when tackling real-life geospatial tasks within urban environments. This limitation stems from a lack of physical world knowledge and relevant data during training. To address this gap, we propose \textit{CityGPT}, a systematic framework designed to enhance LLMs' understanding of urban space and improve their ability to solve the related urban tasks by integrating a city-scale `world model' into the model. Firstly, we construct a diverse instruction tuning dataset, \textit{CityInstruction}, for injecting urban knowledge into LLMs and effectively boosting their spatial reasoning capabilities. Using a combination of \textit{CityInstruction} and open source general instruction data, we introduce a novel and easy-to-use self-weighted fine-tuning method (\textit{SWFT}) to train various LLMs (including ChatGLM3-6B, Llama3-8B, and Qwen2.5-7B) to enhance their urban spatial capabilities without compromising, or even improving, their general abilities. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we develop a comprehensive text-based spatial benchmark \textit{CityEval} for evaluating the performance of LLMs across a wide range of urban scenarios and geospatial tasks. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that smaller LLMs trained with \textit{CityInstruction} by \textit{SWFT} method can achieve performance that is competitive with, and in some cases superior to, proprietary LLMs when assessed using \textit{CityEval}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 Research Track, https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/CityGPT</p></details> |

But moreover, it can also complement big data analytics by mitigating the limitations of observational data, such as incompleteness and reliability issues, thereby enhancing model estimates through the integration of disparate or conflicting data sources. The paper also outlines various strategies for integrating prior information within the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation method and proposes a recursive approach that allows for the analysis of new data as it arrives. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to expert elicitation, with a particular emphasis on spatial and spatio-temporal contexts. Specifically, it introduces a typology of expert-based model implementations that addresses different change of support scenarios between observational and expert data.

| **[GenSpace: Benchmarking Spatially-Aware Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24870v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can intuitively compose and arrange scenes in the 3D space for photography. However, can advanced AI image generators plan scenes with similar 3D spatial awareness when creating images from text or image prompts? We present GenSpace, a novel benchmark and evaluation pipeline to comprehensively assess the spatial awareness of current image generation models. Furthermore, standard evaluations using general Vision-Language Models (VLMs) frequently fail to capture the detailed spatial errors. To handle this challenge, we propose a specialized evaluation pipeline and metric, which reconstructs 3D scene geometry using multiple visual foundation models and provides a more accurate and human-aligned metric of spatial faithfulness. Our findings show that while AI models create visually appealing images and can follow general instructions, they struggle with specific 3D details like object placement, relationships, and measurements. We summarize three core limitations in the spatial perception of current state-of-the-art image generation models: 1) Object Perspective Understanding, 2) Egocentric-Allocentric Transformation and 3) Metric Measurement Adherence, highlighting possible directions for improving spatial intelligence in image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ISDrama: Immersive Spatial Drama Generation through Multimodal Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20630v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal immersive spatial drama generation focuses on creating continuous multi-speaker binaural speech with dramatic prosody based on multimodal prompts, with potential applications in AR, VR, and others. This task requires simultaneous modeling of spatial information and dramatic prosody based on multimodal inputs, with high data collection costs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to address these challenges. We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting. ISDrama comprises these primary components: 1) Multimodal Pose Encoder, based on contrastive learning, considering the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers to extract unified pose information from multimodal prompts. 2) Immersive Drama Transformer, a flow-based mamba-transformer model that generates high-quality drama, incorporating Drama-MOE to select proper experts for enhanced prosody and pose control. We also design a context-consistent classifier-free guidance strategy to coherently generate complete drama. Experimental results show that ISDrama outperforms baseline models on objective and subjective metrics.

| **[Bayesian Inference for Spatially-Temporally Misaligned Data Using Predictive Stacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24397v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Air pollution remains a major environmental risk factor that is often associated with adverse health outcomes. However, quantifying and evaluating its effects on human health is challenging due to the complex nature of exposure data. Recent technological advances have led to the collection of various indicators of air pollution at increasingly high spatial-temporal resolutions (e.g., daily averages of pollutant levels at spatial locations referenced by latitude-longitude). However, health outcomes are typically aggregated over several spatial-temporal coordinates (e.g., annual prevalence for a county) to comply with survey regulations. This article develops a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze such spatially-temporally misaligned exposure and health outcome data. We introduce Bayesian predictive stacking, which optimally combines multiple predictive spatial-temporal models and avoids iterative estimation algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo that struggle due to convergence issues inflicted by the presence of weakly identified parameters. We apply our proposed method to study the effects of ozone on asthma in the state of California.</p></details> | 34 pages, 14 figures |

Egocentric Spatial Reasoning in VLMs Across Disjoint Frames](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24257v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An embodied AI assistant operating on egocentric video must integrate spatial cues across time - for instance, determining where an object A, glimpsed a few moments ago lies relative to an object B encountered later. We introduce Disjoint-3DQA , a generative QA benchmark that evaluates this ability of VLMs by posing questions about object pairs that are not co-visible in the same frame. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art VLMs and found that models lag behind human performance by 28%, with steeper declines in accuracy (60% to 30 %) as the temporal gap widens. Our analysis further reveals that providing trajectories or bird's-eye-view projections to VLMs results in only marginal improvements, whereas providing oracle 3D coordinates leads to a substantial 20% performance increase. This highlights a core bottleneck of multi-frame VLMs in constructing and maintaining 3D scene representations over time from visual signals. Disjoint-3DQA therefore sets a clear, measurable challenge for long-horizon spatial reasoning and aims to catalyze future research at the intersection of vision, language, and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast and flexible inference for spatial extremes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13958v5)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Statistical modelling of spatial extreme events has gained increasing attention over the last few decades with max-stable processes, and more recently $r$-Pareto processes, becoming the reference tools for the statistical analysis of asymptotically dependent data. Although inference for r-Pareto processes is easier than for max-stable processes, there remain major hurdles for their application to high dimensional datasets within a reasonable timeframe. In addition, both approaches have almost exclusively focused on the Brown-Resnick model, for its Gaussian foundations, and for the continuity of its exponent measure. In this paper, we derive a class of models for which this continuity property holds and present the skewed Brown-Resnick model, an extension of the Brown-Resnick that allows for non-stationarity in the dependence structure, and the truncated extremal-t model, a refinement of the well-known extremal-$t$ model. We use an inference methodology based on the intensity function of the process which is derived from the exponent measure, and demonstrate the statistical and computational efficiency of this approach. Applications to two real-world problems illustrate valuable gains in modelling flexibility as well as appealing computational gains over reference methodologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSF-Net: Spatial-Spectral Fusion Network with Spectral Angle Awareness for Hyperspectral Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05852v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral video (HSV) offers valuable spatial, spectral, and temporal information simultaneously, making it highly suitable for handling challenges such as background clutter and visual similarity in object tracking. However, existing methods primarily focus on band regrouping and rely on RGB trackers for feature extraction, resulting in limited exploration of spectral information and difficulties in achieving complementary representations of object features. In this paper, a spatial-spectral fusion network with spectral angle awareness (SST-Net) is proposed for hyperspectral (HS) object tracking. Firstly, to address the issue of insufficient spectral feature extraction in existing networks, a spatial-spectral feature backbone ($S^2$FB) is designed. With the spatial and spectral extraction branch, a joint representation of texture and spectrum is obtained. Secondly, a spectral attention fusion module (SAFM) is presented to capture the intra- and inter-modality correlation to obtain the fused features from the HS and RGB modalities. It can incorporate the visual information into the HS spectral context to form a robust representation. Thirdly, to ensure a more accurate response of the tracker to the object position, a spectral angle awareness module (SAAM) investigates the region-level spectral similarity between the template and search images during the prediction stage. Furthermore, we develop a novel spectral angle awareness loss (SAAL) to offer guidance for the SAAM based on similar regions. Finally, to obtain the robust tracking results, a weighted prediction method is considered to combine the HS and RGB predicted motions of objects to leverage the strengths of each modality. Extensive experiments on the HOTC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SSF-Net, compared with state-of-the-art trackers.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 2025</p></details> |

While quantization offers a pathway to efficiency, existing methods struggle to balance performance and overhead, either incurring high computational/memory costs or failing to address activation outliers, a critical bottleneck in quantized fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose the Outlier Spatial Stability Hypothesis (OSSH): During fine-tuning, certain activation outlier channels retain stable spatial positions across training iterations. Building on OSSH, we propose Quaff, a Quantized parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLMs, optimizing low-precision activation representations through targeted momentum scaling. Quaff dynamically suppresses outliers exclusively in invariant channels using lightweight operations, eliminating full-precision weight storage and global rescaling while reducing quantization errors. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks validate OSSH and demonstrate Quaff's efficacy. Specifically, on the GPQA reasoning benchmark, Quaff achieves a 1.73x latency reduction and 30% memory savings over full-precision fine-tuning while improving accuracy by 0.6% on the Phi-3 model, reconciling the triple trade-off between efficiency, performance, and deployability. By enabling consumer-grade GPU fine-tuning (e.g., RTX 2080 Super) without sacrificing model utility, Quaff democratizes personalized LLM deployment. The code is available at https://github.com/Little0o0/Quaff.git.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |

By embedding the dual-tail novel Archimedean copula viz. A2 directly into the network's weight initialization, A2-SBNN naturally models complex spatial relationships, including rare co-movements in the data. The model is trained through a calibration-driven process combining Wasserstein loss, moment matching, and correlation penalties to refine predictions and manage uncertainty. Simulation results show that A2-SBNN consistently delivers high accuracy across a wide range of dependency strengths, offering a new, effective solution for spatial data modeling beyond traditional Gaussian-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks, however, probe only single-image relations and thus fail to assess the multi-image spatial reasoning that real-world deployments demand. We introduce MMSI-Bench, a VQA benchmark dedicated to multi-image spatial intelligence. Six 3D-vision researchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging, unambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired with carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process. We conduct extensive experiments and thoroughly evaluate 34 open-source and proprietary MLLMs, observing a wide gap: the strongest open-source model attains roughly 30% accuracy and OpenAI's o3 reasoning model reaches 40%, while humans score 97%. These results underscore the challenging nature of MMSI-Bench and the substantial headroom for future research. Leveraging the annotated reasoning processes, we also provide an automated error analysis pipeline that diagnoses four dominant failure modes, including (1) grounding errors, (2) overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors, (3) situation-transformation reasoning errors, and (4) spatial-logic errors, offering valuable insights for advancing multi-image spatial intelligence.

| **[Spatial-MLLM: Boosting MLLM Capabilities in Visual-based Spatial Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23747v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced performance on 2D visual tasks. However, improving their spatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on additional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their utility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this paper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial reasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which rely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our key insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward visual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder architecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and a spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to extract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into unified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we propose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects the spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under limited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial reasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k dataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our spatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of visual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks.

This reasoning ability is also crucial for machines to interact with their environment in a human-like manner. However, recent research shows that even state-of-the-art language models struggle with spatial reasoning over text, especially when facing nesting spatial expressions. This is attributed to not achieving the right level of abstraction required for generalizability. To alleviate this issue, we propose training language models with neuro-symbolic techniques that exploit the spatial logical rules as constraints, providing additional supervision to improve spatial reasoning and question answering. Training language models to adhere to spatial reasoning rules guides them in making more effective and general abstractions for transferring spatial knowledge to various domains. We evaluate our approach on existing spatial question-answering benchmarks. Our results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed technique in improving language models in complex multi-hop spatial reasoning over text.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, NAACL 2025 findings</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Spatial Augmentation for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23438v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS), data augmentation plays a crucial role in the weak-to-strong consistency regularization framework, as it enhances diversity and improves model generalization. Recent strong augmentation methods have primarily focused on intensity-based perturbations, which have minimal impact on the semantic masks. In contrast, spatial augmentations like translation and rotation have long been acknowledged for their effectiveness in supervised semantic segmentation tasks, but they are often ignored in SSSS. In this work, we demonstrate that spatial augmentation can also contribute to model training in SSSS, despite generating inconsistent masks between the weak and strong augmentations. Furthermore, recognizing the variability among images, we propose an adaptive augmentation strategy that dynamically adjusts the augmentation for each instance based on entropy. Extensive experiments show that our proposed Adaptive Spatial Augmentation (\textbf{ASAug}) can be integrated as a pluggable module, consistently improving the performance of existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets such as PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and COCO.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Calibrated Bayesian inference for random fields on large irregular domains using the debiased spatial Whittle likelihood](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23330v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inference for stationary random fields is computationally demanding. Whittle-type likelihoods in the frequency domain based on the fast Fourier Transform (FFT) have several appealing features: i) low computational complexity of only $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of spatial locations, ii) robustness to assumptions of the data-generating process, iii) ability to handle missing data and irregularly spaced domains, and iv) flexibility in modelling the covariance function via the spectral density directly in the spectral domain. It is well known, however, that the Whittle likelihood suffers from bias and low efficiency for spatial data. The debiased Whittle likelihood is a recently proposed alternative with better frequentist properties. We propose a methodology for Bayesian inference for stationary random fields using the debiased spatial Whittle likelihood, with an adjustment from the composite likelihood literature. The adjustment is shown to give a well-calibrated Bayesian posterior as measured by coverage properties of credible sets, without sacrificing the quasi-linear computation time. We apply the method to simulated data and two real datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Meeseeks Mesh: Spatially Consistent 3D Adversarial Objects for BEV Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22499v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D object detection is a critical component in autonomous driving systems. It allows real-time recognition and detection of vehicles, pedestrians and obstacles under varying environmental conditions. Among existing methods, 3D object detection in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) has emerged as the mainstream framework. To guarantee a safe, robust and trustworthy 3D object detection, 3D adversarial attacks are investigated, where attacks are placed in 3D environments to evaluate the model performance, e.g. putting a film on a car, clothing a pedestrian. The vulnerability of 3D object detection models to 3D adversarial attacks serves as an important indicator to evaluate the robustness of the model against perturbations. To investigate this vulnerability, we generate non-invasive 3D adversarial objects tailored for real-world attack scenarios. Our method verifies the existence of universal adversarial objects that are spatially consistent across time and camera views. Specifically, we employ differentiable rendering techniques to accurately model the spatial relationship between adversarial objects and the target vehicle. Furthermore, we introduce an occlusion-aware module to enhance visual consistency and realism under different viewpoints. To maintain attack effectiveness across multiple frames, we design a BEV spatial feature-guided optimization strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can reliably suppress vehicle predictions from state-of-the-art 3D object detectors, serving as an important tool to test robustness of 3D object detection models before deployment. Moreover, the generated adversarial objects exhibit strong generalization capabilities, retaining its effectiveness at various positions and distances in the scene.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Memory-Aided World Models: Benchmarking via Spatial Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22976v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to simulate the world in a spatially consistent manner is a crucial requirements for effective world models. Such a model enables high-quality visual generation, and also ensures the reliability of world models for downstream tasks such as simulation and planning. Designing a memory module is a crucial component for addressing spatial consistency: such a model must not only retain long-horizon observational information, but also enables the construction of explicit or implicit internal spatial representations. However, there are no dataset designed to promote the development of memory modules by explicitly enforcing spatial consistency constraints. Furthermore, most existing benchmarks primarily emphasize visual coherence or generation quality, neglecting the requirement of long-range spatial consistency. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset and corresponding benchmark by sampling 150 distinct locations within the open-world environment of Minecraft, collecting about 250 hours (20 million frames) of loop-based navigation videos with actions. Our dataset follows a curriculum design of sequence lengths, allowing models to learn spatial consistency on increasingly complex navigation trajectories. Furthermore, our data collection pipeline is easily extensible to new Minecraft environments and modules. Four representative world model baselines are evaluated on our benchmark. Dataset, benchmark, and code are open-sourced to support future research.</p></details> |  |

Advances in nanophotonic fabrication and metasurface-based wavefront engineering have opened new pathways to realize high-capacity DONNs across various spectral regimes. Training such DONN systems to determine the metasurface structures remains challenging. Heuristic methods are fast but oversimplify metasurfaces modulation, often resulting in physically unrealizable designs and significant performance degradation. Simulation-in-the-loop optimizes implementable metasurfaces via adjoint methods, but is computationally prohibitive and unscalable. To address these limitations, we propose SP2RINT, a spatially decoupled, progressive training framework that formulates DONN training as a PDE-constrained learning problem. Metasurface responses are first relaxed into freely trainable transfer matrices with a banded structure. We then progressively enforce physical constraints by alternating between transfer matrix training and adjoint-based inverse design, avoiding per-iteration PDE solves while ensuring final physical realizability. To further reduce runtime, we introduce a physics-inspired, spatially decoupled inverse design strategy based on the natural locality of field interactions. This approach partitions the metasurface into independently solvable patches, enabling scalable and parallel inverse design with system-level calibration. Evaluated across diverse DONN training tasks, SP2RINT achieves digital-comparable accuracy while being 1825 times faster than simulation-in-the-loop approaches. By bridging the gap between abstract DONN models and implementable photonic hardware, SP2RINT enables scalable, high-performance training of physically realizable meta-optical neural systems.

In contrast, current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively plan and act in dynamic, multi-room 3D environments. We posit that part of this limitation is due to the lack of proper 3D spatial-temporal memory modeling in LLMs. To address this, we first introduce 3DMem-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over 26,000 trajectories and 2,892 embodied tasks, question-answering and captioning, designed to evaluate an agent's ability to reason over long-term memory in 3D environments. Second, we propose 3DLLM-Mem, a novel dynamic memory management and fusion model for embodied spatial-temporal reasoning and actions in LLMs. Our model uses working memory tokens, which represents current observations, as queries to selectively attend to and fuse the most useful spatial and temporal features from episodic memory, which stores past observations and interactions. Our approach allows the agent to focus on task-relevant information while maintaining memory efficiency in complex, long-horizon environments. Experimental results demonstrate that 3DLLM-Mem achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, outperforming the strongest baselines by 16.5% in success rate on 3DMem-Bench's most challenging in-the-wild embodied tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>demos...</summary><p>demos at: https://3dllm-mem.github.io</p></details> |

To address this challenge, multimodal data synthesis offers a promising solution. Yet, ensuring that synthesized data adhere to spatial common sense is a non-trivial task. In this work, we introduce SKG2Data, a novel multimodal synthesis approach guided by spatial knowledge graphs, grounded in the concept of knowledge-to-data generation. SKG2Data automatically constructs a Spatial Knowledge Graph (SKG) to emulate human-like perception of spatial directions and distances, which is subsequently utilized to guide multimodal data synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data synthesized from diverse types of spatial knowledge, including direction and distance, not only enhance the spatial perception and reasoning abilities of MLLMs but also exhibit strong generalization capabilities. We hope that the idea of knowledge-based data synthesis can advance the development of spatial intelligence.</p></details> | Ongoing work |

We propose a novel machine learning (ML) framework that integrates spatial extreme-value theory to model weather extremes and to quantify probabilities associated with the occurrence, intensity, and spatial extent of these events. Our approach employs new loss functions adapted to extreme values, enabling our model to prioritize the tail rather than the bulk of the data distribution. Applied to a case study of Western European summertime heat extremes, we use daily 500-hPa geopotential height fields and local soil moisture as predictors to capture the complex interplay between local and remote physical processes. Our generative model reveals that different facets of heat extremes are influenced by individual circulation features, such as the relative position of upper-level ridges and troughs that are part of a large-scale wave pattern. This enriches our process understanding from a data-driven perspective. Our approach can extrapolate beyond the range of the data to make risk-related probabilistic statements. It applies more generally to other weather extremes and offers an alternative to traditional physical and ML-based techniques that focus less on the extremal aspects of weather data.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches that rely on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods can capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of odor plumes, but are impractical for large-scale simulations due to their computational expense. On the other hand, puff-based simulations, although computationally tractable for large scales and capable of capturing the stochastic nature of plumes, fail to reproduce naturalistic odor statistics. Here, we present COSMOS (Configurable Odor Simulation Model over Scalable Spaces), a data-driven probabilistic framework that synthesizes realistic odor time series from spatial and temporal features of real datasets. COSMOS generates similar distributions of key statistical features such as whiff frequency, duration, and concentration as observed in real data, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. By reproducing critical statistical properties across a variety of flow regimes and scales, COSMOS enables the development and evaluation of agent-based navigation strategies with naturalistic odor experiences. To demonstrate its utility, we compare odor-tracking agents exposed to CFD-generated plumes versus COSMOS simulations, showing that both their odor experiences and resulting behaviors are quite similar.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 primary figures</p></details> |

For instance, public health officials might be interested in whether air pollution has a strictly positive association with a health outcome, and the magnitude of any effect. Standard machine learning methods often provide accurate predictions but offer limited insight into covariate-response relationships. And we show that existing methods for constructing confidence (or credible) intervals for associations fail to provide nominal coverage in the face of model misspecification and distribution shift - despite both being essentially always present in spatial problems. We introduce a method that constructs valid frequentist confidence intervals for associations in spatial settings. Our method requires minimal assumptions beyond a form of spatial smoothness. In particular, we do not require model correctness or covariate overlap between training and target locations. Our approach is the first to guarantee nominal coverage in this setting and outperforms existing techniques in both real and simulated experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally; 36 pages, 14 figures</p></details> |

To this end, we develop a spatial Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) for the post-processing of surface maximum wind gusts from the COSMO-REA6 reanalysis. Our approach uses a non-stationary extreme value distribution for the gust observations, with parameters that vary according to a linear model using COSMO-REA6 predictor variables. To capture spatial patterns in surface wind gust behavior, the regression coefficients are modeled as 2-dimensional Gaussian random fields with a constant mean and an isotropic covariance function that depends on the distance between locations. In addition, we include an elevation offset in the distance metric for the covariance function to account for the topography. This allows us to include data from mountaintop stations in the training process. The training of the BHM is carried out with an independent data set from which the data at the station to be predicted are excluded. We evaluate the spatial prediction performance at the withheld station using Brier score and quantile score, including their decomposition, and compare the performance of our BHM to climatological forecasts and a non-hierarchical, spatially constant baseline model. This is done for 109 weather stations in Germany. Compared to the spatially constant baseline model, the spatial BHM significantly improves the estimation of local gust parameters. It shows up to 5 % higher skill for prediction quantiles and provides a particularly improved skill for extreme wind gusts. In addition, the BHM improves the prediction of threshold levels at most of the stations. Although a spatially constant approach already provides high skill, our BHM further improves predictions and improves spatial consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 Pa...</summary><p>41 Pages, 17 figures.

While current SNN hardware accelerators often prioritize temporal spike sparsity, exploiting sparse synaptic weights offers significant untapped potential for even greater efficiency. To address this, we propose FireFly-S, a Sparse extension of the FireFly series. This co-optimized software-hardware design focusing on leveraging dual-side sparsity for acceleration. On the software side, we propose a novel algorithmic optimization framework that combines gradient rewiring for pruning and modified Learned Step Size Quantization (LSQ) tailored for SNNs, which achieves remarkable weight sparsity exceeding 85\% and enables efficient 4-bit quantization with negligible accuracy loss. On the hardware side, we present an efficient dual-side sparsity detector employing a Bitmap-based sparse decoding logic to pinpoint the positions of non-zero weights and input spikes. The logic allows for the direct bypassing of redundant computations, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Different from the overlay architecture adopted by previous FireFly series, we adopt a spatial architecture with inter-layer pipelining that can fully exploit the nature of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). A spatial-temporal dataflow is also proposed to support such inter-layer pipelining and avoid long-term temporal dependencies. In experiments conducted on the MNIST, DVS-Gesture and CIFAR-10 datasets, the FireFly-S model achieves 85-95\% sparsity with 4-bit quantization and the hardware accelerator effectively leverages the dual-side sparsity, delivering outstanding performance metrics of 10,047 FPS/W on MNIST, 3,683 FPS/W on DVS-Gesture, and 2,327 FPS/W on CIFAR-10.</p></details> |  |

We target a change in distribution that occurs in a small, unknown subset of dimensions, where these dimensions may be correlated. Our work is motivated by a remote sensing application, where changes occur in small, spatially clustered regions over time. An adaptive block-based change-point detection framework is proposed that accounts for spatial dependencies across dimensions and leverages these dependencies to boost detection power and improve estimation accuracy. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our approach has superior performance in detecting sparse changes in datasets with spatial or local group structures. An application of the proposed method to detect activity, such as new construction, in remote sensing imagery of the Natanz Nuclear facility in Iran is presented to demonstrate the method's efficacy.</p></details> |  |

We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zju-real.github.io/ViewSpatial-Page/</p></details> |

However, existing PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking, which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens. This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for the classification tasks on the OBJ-BG, OBJ-ONLY, and PB-T50-RS subsets of ScanObjectNN.

We introduce SURDS, a large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision language models (VLMs). Built on the nuScenes dataset, SURDS comprises 41,080 vision-question-answer training instances and 9,250 evaluation samples, spanning six spatial categories: orientation, depth estimation, pixel-level localization, pairwise distance, lateral ordering, and front-behind relations. We benchmark leading general-purpose VLMs, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen, revealing persistent limitations in fine-grained spatial understanding. To address these deficiencies, we go beyond static evaluation and explore whether alignment techniques can improve spatial reasoning performance. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning-based alignment scheme leveraging spatially grounded reward signals - capturing both perception-level accuracy (location) and reasoning consistency (logic). We further incorporate final-answer correctness and output-format rewards to guide fine-grained policy adaptation. Our GRPO-aligned variant achieves an overall score of 40.80 in the SURDS benchmark. Notably, it outperforms proprietary systems such as GPT-4o (13.30) and Gemini-2.0-flash (35.71). To our best knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that reinforcement learning-based alignment can significantly and consistently enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in real-world driving contexts. We release the SURDS benchmark, evaluation toolkit, and GRPO alignment code through: https://github.com/XiandaGuo/Drive-MLLM.</p></details> |  |

However, existing multimodal mathematics benchmarks mainly focus on plane geometry and largely ignore solid geometry, which requires spatial reasoning and is more challenging than plane geometry. To address this critical gap, we introduce SolidGeo, the first large-scale benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the performance of MLLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks in solid geometry. SolidGeo consists of 3,113 real-world K-12 and competition-level problems, each paired with visual context and annotated with difficulty levels and fine-grained solid geometry categories. Our benchmark covers a wide range of 3D reasoning subjects such as projection, unfolding, spatial measurement, and spatial vector, offering a rigorous testbed for assessing solid geometry. Through extensive experiments, we observe that MLLMs encounter substantial challenges in solid geometry math tasks, with a considerable performance gap relative to human capabilities on SolidGeo. Moreover, we analyze the performance, inference efficiency and error patterns of various models, offering insights into the solid geometric mathematical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. We hope SolidGeo serves as a catalyst for advancing MLLMs toward deeper geometric reasoning and spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

AI agents with the spatial planning ability can better adapt to various real-world applications, including robotic manipulation, automatic assembly, urban planning etc. Recent works have attempted to construct benchmarks for evaluating the spatial intelligence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Nevertheless, these benchmarks primarily focus on spatial reasoning based on typical Visual Question-Answering (VQA) forms, which suffers from the gap between abstract spatial understanding and concrete task execution. In this work, we take a step further to build a comprehensive benchmark called MineAnyBuild, aiming to evaluate the spatial planning ability of open-world AI agents in the Minecraft game. Specifically, MineAnyBuild requires an agent to generate executable architecture building plans based on the given multi-modal human instructions. It involves 4,000 curated spatial planning tasks and also provides a paradigm for infinitely expandable data collection by utilizing rich player-generated content. MineAnyBuild evaluates spatial planning through four core supporting dimensions: spatial understanding, spatial reasoning, creativity, and spatial commonsense. Based on MineAnyBuild, we perform a comprehensive evaluation for existing MLLM-based agents, revealing the severe limitations but enormous potential in their spatial planning abilities. We believe our MineAnyBuild will open new avenues for the evaluation of spatial intelligence and help promote further development for open-world AI agents capable of spatial planning.</p></details> |  |

In this dataset, LLMs are provided with conditions such as 2D boundary, applied forces and supports, and must reason about the resulting optimal material distribution. The dataset includes a variety of tasks, ranging from filling in masked regions within partial structures to predicting complete material distributions. Solving these tasks requires understanding the flow of forces and the required material distribution under given constraints, without access to simulation tools or explicit physical models, challenging models to reason about structural stability and spatial organization. Our dataset targets the evaluation of spatial and physical reasoning abilities in 2D settings, offering a complementary perspective to traditional language and logic benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

While mapping from feature space to input space aids in interpreting the former, existing approaches often rely on crude approximations. We propose using a conditional diffusion model - a pretrained high-fidelity diffusion model conditioned on spatially resolved feature maps - to learn such a mapping in a probabilistic manner. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach across various pretrained image classifiers from CNNs to ViTs, showing excellent reconstruction capabilities. Through qualitative comparisons and robustness analysis, we validate our method and showcase possible applications, such as the visualization of concept steering in input space or investigations of the composite nature of the feature space. This approach has broad potential for improving feature space understanding in computer vision models.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures, code is available at https://github.com/AI4HealthUOL/FeatInv</p></details> |

While prior imitation-learning approaches have made progress, their reliance on raw RGB inputs and handcrafted features often leads to overfitting and poor 3D reasoning under varied lighting, occlusion, and object conditions. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that couples robust multimodal perception with reliable grasp prediction. Our architecture fuses domain-randomized augmentation, monocular depth estimation, and a depth-aware 6-DoF Grasp Prompt into a single spatial representation for downstream action planning. Conditioned on this encoding and a high-level task prompt, our diffusion-based policy yields precise action sequences, achieving up to 40% improvement in grasp success and 45% higher task success rates under environmental variation. These results demonstrate that spatially grounded perception, paired with diffusion-based imitation learning, offers a scalable and robust solution for general-purpose robotic grasping.</p></details> |  |
| **[Byzantine-Resilient Distributed P2P Energy Trading via Spatial-Temporal Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20567v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading mandates an escalating coupling between the physical power network and communication network, necessitating high-frequency sharing of real-time data among prosumers. However, this data-sharing scheme renders the system vulnerable to various malicious behaviors, as Byzantine agents can initiate cyberattacks by injecting sophisticated false data. To better investigate the impacts of malicious Byzantine faults, this paper develops a fully distributed P2P energy trading model by accounting for the high-fidelity physical network constraints. To further detect Byzantine faults and mitigate their impacts on distributed P2P energy trading problem, we propose an online spatial-temporal anomaly detection approach by leveraging the tensor learning method, which is informed by the domain knowledge to enable awesome detection performance. Moreover, to enhance its computational efficiency, we further develop closed-form solutions for the proposed detection approach. Subsequently, we derive theoretical conditions for guaranteeing optimality and convergence of the distributed P2P energy trading problem with anomaly detection mechanisms. Results from numerical simulations validate the effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Spatial Interpolation of Sparse Data using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00033v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The large underlying assumption of climate models today relies on the basis of a "confident" initial condition, a reasonably plausible snapshot of the Earth for which all future predictions depend on. However, given the inherently chaotic nature of our system, this assumption is complicated by sensitive dependence, where small uncertainties in initial conditions can lead to exponentially diverging outcomes over time. This challenge is particularly salient at global spatial scales and over centennial timescales, where data gaps are not just common but expected. The source of uncertainty is two-fold: (1) sparse, noisy observations from satellites and ground stations, and (2) internal variability stemming from the simplifying approximations within the models themselves. In practice, data assimilation methods are used to reconcile this missing information by conditioning model states on partial observations. Our work builds on this idea but operates at the extreme end of sparsity. We propose a conditional data imputation framework that reconstructs full temperature fields from as little as 1% observational coverage. The method leverages a diffusion model guided by a prekriged mask, effectively inferring the full-state fields from minimal data points. We validate our framework over the Southern Great Plains, focusing on afternoon (12:00-6:00 PM) temperature fields during the summer months of 2018-2020. Across varying observational densities--from swath data to isolated in-situ sensors--our model achieves strong reconstruction accuracy, highlighting its potential to fill in critical data gaps in both historical reanalysis and real-time forecasting pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 14 figures, submitted to AMS Artificial Intelligence for the Earth Systems</p></details> |

We introduce Direct3D-S2, a scalable 3D generation framework based on sparse volumes that achieves superior output quality with dramatically reduced training costs. Our key innovation is the Spatial Sparse Attention (SSA) mechanism, which greatly enhances the efficiency of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) computations on sparse volumetric data. SSA allows the model to effectively process large token sets within sparse volumes, substantially reducing computational overhead and achieving a 3.9x speedup in the forward pass and a 9.6x speedup in the backward pass. Our framework also includes a variational autoencoder (VAE) that maintains a consistent sparse volumetric format across input, latent, and output stages. Compared to previous methods with heterogeneous representations in 3D VAE, this unified design significantly improves training efficiency and stability. Our model is trained on public available datasets, and experiments demonstrate that Direct3D-S2 not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generation quality and efficiency, but also enables training at 1024 resolution using only 8 GPUs, a task typically requiring at least 32 GPUs for volumetric representations at 256 resolution, thus making gigascale 3D generation both practical and accessible.

We investigate this gap through Transformation-Driven Visual Reasoning (TVR), a challenging task requiring identification of object transformations across images under varying viewpoints. While traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in cross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we propose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm with a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1 rewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive inaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios. Further analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its unique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning. Our work provides critical insights in advancing the research of MLLMs and reasoning models. The codes, model weights, and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/zongzhao23/STAR-R1.</p></details> |  |

We propose a surrogate function for the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimator, which facilitates the use of classical graph cut algorithms to learn the optimal design. Our proposal offers three key advances: (1) it accommodates moderate to large spatial interference effects; (2) it adapts to different spatial covariance functions; (3) it is computationally efficient. Theoretical results and numerical experiments based on synthetic environments and a dispatch simulator that models a city-scale ridesharing market, further validate the effectiveness of our design.

This limitation constrains their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints. Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.</p></details> |  |

Given the limitations of conventional signal processing and the scarcity of deep learning approaches to spatial aliasing mitigation, we propose a novel approach using a U-Net architecture to predict a signal-dependent de-aliasing filter, which reduces aliasing in conventional beamforming for spatial capture. Two types of multichannel filters are considered, one which treats the channels independently and a second one that models cross-channel dependencies. The proposed approach is evaluated in two common spatial capture scenarios: stereo and first-order Ambisonics. The results indicate a very significant improvement, both objective and perceptual, with respect to conventional beamforming. This work shows the potential of deep learning to reduce aliasing in beamforming, leading to improvements in multi-microphone setups.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures; accepted for presentation in Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

Achieving successful VSR requires producing realistic HR details and ensuring both spatial and temporal consistency. To restore realistic details, diffusion-based VSR approaches have recently been proposed. However, the inherent randomness of diffusion, combined with their tile-based approach, often leads to spatio-temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose DC-VSR, a novel VSR approach to produce spatially and temporally consistent VSR results with realistic textures. To achieve spatial and temporal consistency, DC-VSR adopts a novel Spatial Attention Propagation (SAP) scheme and a Temporal Attention Propagation (TAP) scheme that propagate information across spatio-temporal tiles based on the self-attention mechanism. To enhance high-frequency details, we also introduce Detail-Suppression Self-Attention Guidance (DSSAG), a novel diffusion guidance scheme. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DC-VSR achieves spatially and temporally consistent, high-quality VSR results, outperforming previous approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contributions from first two authors</p></details> |

However, most existing dimension reduction techniques do not account for the spatial correlation between observations and do not take the downstream modeling task into consideration when finding the lower-dimensional representation. We formalize the closeness of approximation to the original data and the utility of lower-dimensional scores for downstream modeling as two complementary, sometimes conflicting, metrics for dimension reduction. We illustrate how existing methodologies fall into this framework and propose a flexible dimension reduction algorithm that achieves the optimal trade-off. We derive a computationally simple form for our algorithm and illustrate its performance through simulation studies, as well as two applications in air pollution modeling and spatial transcriptomics.</p></details> |  |

This fragility stems from the lack of persistent memory to track evolving goals and task dependencies, undermining trust in autonomous agents. We introduce the Task Memory Engine (TME), a modular memory controller that transforms existing LLMs into robust, revision-aware agents without fine-tuning. TME implements a spatial memory framework that replaces flat context with graph-based structures to support consistent, multi-turn reasoning. Departing from linear concatenation and ReAct-style prompting, TME builds a dynamic task graph -- either a tree or directed acyclic graph (DAG) -- to map user inputs to subtasks, align them with prior context, and enable dependency-tracked revisions. Its Task Representation and Intent Management (TRIM) component models task semantics and user intent to ensure accurate interpretation. Across four multi-turn scenarios-trip planning, cooking, meeting scheduling, and shopping cart editing -- TME eliminates 100% of hallucinations and misinterpretations in three tasks, and reduces hallucinations by 66.7% and misinterpretations by 83.3% across 27 user turns, outperforming ReAct. TME's modular design supports plug-and-play deployment and domain-specific customization, adaptable to both personal assistants and enterprise automation. We release TME's codebase, benchmarks, and components as open-source resources, enabling researchers to develop reliable LLM agents. TME's scalable architecture addresses a critical gap in agent performance across complex, interactive settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. 9 pages main content, 15 pages appendix, 5 figures</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we develop a scalable Bayesian framework for spatially varying coefficient (SVC) models, implemented in the \pkg{svc} R package (available at https://github.com/jdta95/svc), which allows regression coefficients to vary smoothly over space. Our approach combines three key computational innovations: (1) a subset Gaussian process approximation that reduces the computational burden from $O(n^3)$ to $O(m^3)$ with $m<n$, while maintaining predictive accuracy; (2) a robust adaptive Metropolis (RAM) algorithm that automatically tunes proposal distributions for efficient MCMC sampling of spatial range parameters; and (3) optimized linear algebra operations leveraging precomputed distance matrices and Cholesky decompositions to accelerate covariance calculations. We present the model's theoretical foundation, prior specification, and Gibbs sampling algorithm, with a focus on practical implementation for large spatial datasets. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in computational efficiency while maintaining competitive estimation accuracy. We illustrate its application in an analysis of land surface temperature (LST) data, revealing spatially varying effects of vegetation and emissivity that would be obscured by traditional regression techniques. The \pkg{svc} package provides researchers with a flexible, efficient tool for uncovering and quantifying nonstationary spatial relationships across diverse scientific domains.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks have issues like relying on bounding boxes, ignoring perspective substitutions, or allowing questions to be answered using only the model's prior knowledge without image understanding. To address these issues, we introduce SpatialMQA, a human-annotated spatial relation reasoning benchmark based on COCO2017, which enables MLLMs to focus more on understanding images in the objective world. To ensure data quality, we design a well-tailored annotation procedure, resulting in SpatialMQA consisting of 5,392 samples. Based on this benchmark, a series of closed- and open-source MLLMs are implemented and the results indicate that the current state-of-the-art MLLM achieves only 48.14% accuracy, far below the human-level accuracy of 98.40%. Extensive experimental analyses are also conducted, suggesting the future research directions.

However, existing training methods treat heterogeneous nodes with a fully averaged perspective, resulting in inherently biased prediction targets. Balancing accuracy and consistency is particularly challenging due to the multi-objective nature of spatial-temporal forecasting. To address this issue, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-Informed Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) framework that delivers both uniform and precise spatial-temporal predictions. From a model architecture perspective, we design the Heterogeneity-Informed Graph Convolutional Network (HiGCN) to address trend heterogeneity, and we introduce the Node-wise Mixture-of-Experts (NMoE) module to handle cardinality heterogeneity across nodes. From an evaluation perspective, we propose STFairBench, a benchmark that handles fairness in spatial-temporal prediction from both training and evaluation stages. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that HiMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baseline by at least 9.22% across all evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, this remains significantly challenging, leading prior works to rely on large-scale web datasets to improve the grounding accuracy. In this work, we propose Reasoning Graphical User Interface Grounding for Data Efficiency (ReGUIDE), a novel and effective framework for web grounding that enables MLLMs to learn data efficiently through self-generated reasoning and spatial-aware criticism. More specifically, ReGUIDE learns to (i) self-generate a language reasoning process for the localization via online reinforcement learning, and (ii) criticize the prediction using spatial priors that enforce equivariance under input transformations. At inference time, ReGUIDE further boosts performance through a test-time scaling strategy, which combines spatial search with coordinate aggregation. Our experiments demonstrate that ReGUIDE significantly advances web grounding performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming baselines with substantially fewer training data points (e.g., only 0.2% samples compared to the best open-sourced baselines).</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajMoE: Spatially-Aware Mixture of Experts for Unified Human Mobility Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18670v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling human mobility across diverse cities is essential for applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, and personalized services. However, generalization remains challenging due to heterogeneous spatial representations and mobility patterns across cities. Existing methods typically rely on numerical coordinates or require training city-specific models, limiting their scalability and transferability. We propose TrajMoE, a unified and scalable model for cross-city human mobility modeling. TrajMoE addresses two key challenges: (1) inconsistent spatial semantics across cities, and (2) diverse urban mobility patterns. To tackle these, we begin by designing a spatial semantic encoder that learns transferable location representations from POI-based functional semantics and visit patterns. Furthermore, we design a Spatially-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (SAMoE) Transformer that injects structured priors into experts specialized in distinct mobility semantics, along with a shared expert to capture city-invariant patterns and enable adaptive cross-city generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajMoE achieves up to 27% relative improvement over competitive mobility foundation models after only one epoch of fine-tuning, and consistently outperforms full-data baselines using merely 5% of target city data. These results establish TrajMoE as a significant step toward realizing a truly generalizable, transferable, and pretrainable foundation model for human mobility.</p></details> |  |

Geo-spatial datasets pose distinct challenges due to their dense numerical values, strong spatial and temporal dependencies, and unique multimodal representations including tabular data, heatmaps, and geographic visualizations. To assess how foundation models can support scientific research in this domain, GeoGrid-Bench features large-scale, real-world data covering 16 climate variables across 150 locations and extended time frames. The benchmark includes approximately 3,200 question-answer pairs, systematically generated from 8 domain expert-curated templates to reflect practical tasks encountered by human scientists. These range from basic queries at a single location and time to complex spatiotemporal comparisons across regions and periods. Our evaluation reveals that vision-language models perform best overall, and we provide a fine-grained analysis of the strengths and limitations of different foundation models in different geo-spatial tasks. This benchmark offers clearer insights into how foundation models can be effectively applied to geo-spatial data analysis and used to support scientific research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Hyperspheric Models for Compositional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03648v3)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional observations are an increasingly prevalent data source in spatial statistics. Analysis of such data is typically done on log-ratio transformations or via Dirichlet regression. However, these approaches often make unnecessarily strong assumptions (e.g., strictly positive components, exclusively negative correlations). An alternative approach uses square-root transformed compositions and directional distributions. Such distributions naturally allow for zero-valued components and positive correlations, yet they may include support outside the non-negative orthant and are not generative for compositional data. To overcome this challenge, we truncate the elliptically symmetric angular Gaussian (ESAG) distribution to the non-negative orthant. Additionally, we propose a spatial hyperspheric regression model that contains fixed and random multivariate spatial effects. The proposed model also contains a term that can be used to propagate uncertainty that may arise from precursory stochastic models (i.e., machine learning classification). We used our model in a simulation study and for a spatial analysis of classified bioacoustic signals of the Dryobates pubescens (downy woodpecker).</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 10 figures, 6 appendices</p></details> |

In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. We identify sets of individuals whose overlap shows a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures plus supplementary information with 12 pages, methods, model and 4 figures of results</p></details> |

To create engaging forms of experiencing auditory Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH), we designed a spatial interaction-based segmented-audio (SISA) Virtual Reality system that transforms passive ICH experiences into active ones. We undertook: (1) a co-design workshop with seven stakeholders to establish design requirements, (2) prototyping with five participants to validate design elements, and (3) user testing with 16 participants exploring Peking Opera. We designed transformations of temporal music into spatial interactions by cutting sounds into short audio segments, applying t-SNE algorithm to cluster audio segments spatially. Users navigate through these sounds by their similarity in audio property. Analysis revealed two distinct interaction patterns (Progressive and Adaptive), and demonstrated SISA's efficacy in facilitating active auditory ICH engagement. Our work illuminates the design process for enriching traditional performance artform using spatially-tuned forms of listening.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Spatial Dependence in Transcriptomics Data using Vectorised Persistence Diagrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03575v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating spatial patterns in data is an integral task across various domains, including geostatistics, astronomy, and spatial tissue biology. The analysis of transcriptomics data in particular relies on methods for detecting spatially-dependent features that exhibit significant spatial patterns for both explanatory analysis and feature selection. However, given the complex and high-dimensional nature of these data, there is a need for robust, stable, and reliable descriptors of spatial dependence. We leverage the stability and multiscale properties of persistent homology to address this task. To this end, we introduce a novel framework using functional topological summaries, such as Betti curves and persistence landscapes, for identifying and describing non-random patterns in spatial data. In particular, we propose a non-parametric one-sample permutation test for spatial dependence and investigate its utility across both simulated and real spatial omics data. Our vectorised approach outperforms baseline methods at accurately detecting spatial dependence. Further, we find that our method is more robust to outliers than alternative tests using Moran's I.</p></details> |  |

While simplified paradigms have advanced the understanding of spatial hearing, their lack of ecological validity limits their applicability to real-life conditions. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the effects of listener movement, reverberation, and distance on localisation accuracy in a more ecologically valid context. Participants performed active localisation tasks with no specific instructions on listening strategy, in either anechoic or reverberant conditions. The results indicate that the head movements were more frequent in reverberant environments, suggesting an adaptive strategy to mitigate uncertainty in binaural cues due to reverberation. While distance did not affect the listening strategy, it influenced the localisation performance. Our outcomes suggest that listening behaviour is adapted depending on the current acoustic conditions to support an effective perception of the space.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

While existing SFDA methods have proven effective in reducing reliance on source data, they struggle to perform well on multivariate time series (MTS) due to their failure to consider the intrinsic spatial correlations inherent in MTS data. These spatial correlations are crucial for accurately representing MTS data and preserving invariant information across domains. To address this challenge, we propose Temporal Restoration and Spatial Rewiring (TERSE), a novel and concise SFDA method tailored for MTS data. Specifically, TERSE comprises a customized spatial-temporal feature encoder designed to capture the underlying spatial-temporal characteristics, coupled with both temporal restoration and spatial rewiring tasks to reinstate latent representations of the temporally masked time series and the spatially masked correlated structures. During the target adaptation phase, the target encoder is guided to produce spatially and temporally consistent features with the source domain by leveraging the source pre-trained temporal restoration and spatial rewiring networks. Therefore, TERSE can effectively model and transfer spatial-temporal dependencies across domains, facilitating implicit feature alignment. In addition, as the first approach to simultaneously consider spatial-temporal consistency in MTS-SFDA, TERSE can also be integrated as a versatile plug-and-play module into established SFDA methods. Extensive experiments on three real-world time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feasible Action Space Reduction for Quantifying Causal Responsibility in Continuous Spatial Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17739v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the causal influence of one agent on another agent is crucial for safely deploying artificially intelligent systems such as automated vehicles and mobile robots into human-inhabited environments. Existing models of causal responsibility deal with simplified abstractions of scenarios with discrete actions, thus, limiting real-world use when understanding responsibility in spatial interactions. Based on the assumption that spatially interacting agents are embedded in a scene and must follow an action at each instant, Feasible Action-Space Reduction (FeAR) was proposed as a metric for causal responsibility in a grid-world setting with discrete actions. Since real-world interactions involve continuous action spaces, this paper proposes a formulation of the FeAR metric for measuring causal responsibility in space-continuous interactions. We illustrate the utility of the metric in prototypical space-sharing conflicts, and showcase its applications for analysing backward-looking responsibility and in estimating forward-looking responsibility to guide agent decision making. Our results highlight the potential of the FeAR metric for designing and engineering artificial agents, as well as for assessing the responsibility of agents around humans.</p></details> | In review |

However, existing methods typically rely on transformer-based architectures, which often face challenges related to scalability and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel, efficient human-human interaction generation method based on the Mamba framework, designed to meet the demands of effectively capturing long-sequence dependencies while providing real-time feedback. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba framework that utilizes two parallel SSM branches with an adaptive mechanism to integrate the spatial and temporal features of motion sequences. To further enhance the model's ability to capture dependencies within individual motion sequences and the interactions between different individual sequences, we develop two key modules: the self-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module and the cross-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module, enabling efficient feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two interaction datasets with remarkable quality and efficiency. Compared to the baseline method InterGen, our approach not only improves accuracy but also requires a minimal parameter size of just 66M ,only 36% of InterGen's, while achieving an average inference speed of 0.57 seconds, which is 46% of InterGen's execution time.</p></details> |  |

Many end-to-end approaches rely on human annotations to learn intermediate perception and prediction tasks, while purely self-supervised approaches--which directly learn from sensor inputs to generate planning trajectories without human annotations often underperform the state of the art. We observe a key gap in the input representation space: end-to-end approaches built on MLLMs are often pretrained with reasoning tasks in 2D image space rather than the native 3D space in which autonomous vehicles plan. To this end, we propose S4-Driver, a scalable self-supervised motion planning algorithm with spatio-temporal visual representation, based on the popular PaLI multimodal large language model. S4-Driver uses a novel sparse volume strategy to seamlessly transform the strong visual representation of MLLMs from perspective view to 3D space without the need to finetune the vision encoder. This representation aggregates multi-view and multi-frame visual inputs and enables better prediction of planning trajectories in 3D space. To validate our method, we run experiments on both nuScenes and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (with in-house camera data). Results show that S4-Driver performs favorably against existing supervised multi-task approaches while requiring no human annotations. It also demonstrates great scalability when pretrained on large volumes of unannotated driving logs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025; Project website: s4-driver.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541v4)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

They provide policymakers with the granular information needed to identify, target, and implement effective interventions and allocate resources appropriately. Traditional disease mapping methods typically rely on Poisson regression, modeling observed counts while adjusting for local covariates that are treated as fixed and known. However, these methods may fail to capture the complexities and uncertainties in areas with sparse or absent data. To address this challenge, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal top-down approach designed to estimate county-level OUD rates when direct small-area (county) data is unavailable. This method allows us to infer small-area OUD rates and quantify associated uncertainties, even in data-sparse environments using observed state-level OUD rates and a combination of state and county level informative covariates. We applied our approach to estimate OUD rates for 3,143 counties in the United States between 2010 and 2025. Model performance was assessed through simulation studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unraveling Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models via the Pipeline Lens: A Comprehensive Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01364v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal deep learning models aims to utilize useful patterns in such data to support tasks like prediction. However, previous deep learning models designed for specific tasks typically require separate training for each use case, leading to increased computational and storage costs. To address this issue, spatio-temporal foundation models have emerged, offering a unified framework capable of solving multiple spatio-temporal tasks. These foundation models achieve remarkable success by learning general knowledge with spatio-temporal data or transferring the general capabilities of pre-trained language models. While previous surveys have explored spatio-temporal data and methodologies separately, they have ignored a comprehensive examination of how foundation models are designed, selected, pre-trained, and adapted. As a result, the overall pipeline for spatio-temporal foundation models remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we innovatively provide an up-to-date review of previous spatio-temporal foundation models from the pipeline perspective. The pipeline begins with an introduction to different types of spatio-temporal data, followed by details of data preprocessing and embedding techniques. The pipeline then presents a novel data property taxonomy to divide existing methods according to data sources and dependencies, providing efficient and effective model design and selection for researchers. On this basis, we further illustrate the training objectives of primitive models, as well as the adaptation techniques of transferred models. Overall, our survey provides a clear and structured pipeline to understand the connection between core elements of spatio-temporal foundation models while guiding researchers to get started quickly. Additionally, we introduce emerging opportunities such as multi-objective training in the field of spatio-temporal foundation models.</p></details> | 21 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Decoupled Learning for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01117v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention for their potential to enable energy-efficient artificial intelligence. However, effective and efficient training of SNNs remains an unresolved challenge. While backpropagation through time (BPTT) achieves high accuracy, it incurs substantial memory overhead. In contrast, biologically plausible local learning methods are more memory-efficient but struggle to match the accuracy of BPTT. To bridge this gap, we propose spatio-temporal decouple learning (STDL), a novel training framework that decouples the spatial and temporal dependencies to achieve both high accuracy and training efficiency for SNNs. Specifically, to achieve spatial decoupling, STDL partitions the network into smaller subnetworks, each of which is trained independently using an auxiliary network. To address the decreased synergy among subnetworks resulting from spatial decoupling, STDL constructs each subnetwork's auxiliary network by selecting the largest subset of layers from its subsequent network layers under a memory constraint. Furthermore, STDL decouples dependencies across time steps to enable efficient online learning. Extensive evaluations on seven static and event-based vision datasets demonstrate that STDL consistently outperforms local learning methods and achieves comparable accuracy to the BPTT method with considerably reduced GPU memory cost. Notably, STDL achieves 4x reduced GPU memory than BPTT on the ImageNet dataset. Therefore, this work opens up a promising avenue for memory-efficient SNN training.

In this paper, we propose a noise-robust real-world VSR framework by incorporating self-supervised learning and Mamba into pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure content consistency across adjacent frames, we enhance the diffusion model with a global spatio-temporal attention mechanism using the Video State-Space block with a 3D Selective Scan module, which reinforces coherence at an affordable computational cost. To further reduce artifacts in generated details, we introduce a self-supervised ControlNet that leverages HR features as guidance and employs contrastive learning to extract degradation-insensitive features from LR videos. Finally, a three-stage training strategy based on a mixture of HR-LR videos is proposed to stabilize VSR training. The proposed Self-supervised ControlNet with Spatio-Temporal Continuous Mamba based VSR algorithm achieves superior perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Fixed Variables: Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatio-temporal Focal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15296v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research focus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the interpretable spatio-temporal features extraction by soft sensors remains a challenge. In this light, this work introduces a novel method termed spatio-temporal consistent and interpretable model (STCIM). First, temporal and spatial features are captured and aligned by a far topological spatio-temporal consistency extraction block. Then, the features are mapped into an interpretable latent space for further prediction by explicitly giving physical meanings to latent variables. The efficacy of the proposed STCIM is demonstrated through the modeling of two generated datasets and a real-life dataset of coal-fired power plants. The corresponding experiments show: 1) The generalization of STCIM outperforms other methods, especially in different operation situations. 2) The far topological spatio-temporal consistency is vital for feature alignment. 3) The hyper-parameters of physics-informed interpretable latent space loss decide the performance of STCIM.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately forecasting STTS is challenging due to complex dynamic correlations in both time and space dimensions. Existing graph neural networks struggle to balance effectiveness and efficiency in modeling dynamic spatio-temporal relations. To address this problem, we propose the Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Stiefel Graph Neural Network (DST-SGNN) to efficiently process STTS. For DST-SGNN, we first introduce the novel Stiefel Graph Spectral Convolution (SGSC) and Stiefel Graph Fourier Transform (SGFT). The SGFT matrix in SGSC is constrained to lie on the Stiefel manifold, and SGSC can be regarded as a filtered graph spectral convolution. We also propose the Linear Dynamic Graph Optimization on Stiefel Manifold (LDGOSM), which can efficiently learn the SGFT matrix from the dynamic graph and significantly reduce the computational complexity. Finally, we propose a multi-layer SGSC (MSGSC) that efficiently captures complex spatio-temporal correlations. Extensive experiments on seven spatio-temporal datasets show that DST-SGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relatively low computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

While Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are popular for modeling spatial dependencies, they rely on predefined adjacency structures and dynamic attention scores, introducing inductive biases and computational overhead that can obscure interpretability. We propose InterGAT, a simplified alternative to GAT that replaces masked attention with a fully learnable, symmetric node interaction matrix, capturing latent spatial relationships without relying on fixed graph topologies. Our framework, InterGAT-GRU, which incorporates a GRU-based temporal decoder, outperforms the baseline GAT-GRU in forecasting accuracy, achieving at least a 21% improvement on the SZ-Taxi dataset and a 6% improvement on the Los-Loop dataset across all forecasting horizons (15 to 60 minutes). Additionally, we observed reduction in training time by 60-70% compared to GAT-GRU baseline. Crucially, the learned interaction matrix reveals interpretable structure: it recovers sparse, topology-aware attention patterns that align with community structure. Spectral and clustering analyses show that the model captures both localized and global dynamics, offering insights into the functional topology driving predictions. This highlights how structure learning can simultaneously support prediction, computational efficiency, and topological interpretabil-ity in dynamic graph-based domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, workshop</p></details> |

However, real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as signal anomalies, noise, and distributional shifts. Existing solutions primarily enhance robustness by modifying network architectures or training procedures. Nevertheless, these approaches are computationally intensive and resource-demanding, especially for large-scale applications. In this paper, we explore a novel test-time computing paradigm, namely learning with calibration, ST-TTC, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through learning with calibration, we aim to capture periodic structural biases arising from non-stationarity during the testing phase and perform real-time bias correction on predictions to improve accuracy. Specifically, we first introduce a spectral-domain calibrator with phase-amplitude modulation to mitigate periodic shift and then propose a flash updating mechanism with a streaming memory queue for efficient test-time computation. ST-TTC effectively bypasses complex training-stage techniques, offering an efficient and generalizable paradigm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, universality, flexibility and efficiency of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

It provides a systematic approach to quantifying resource consumption, emissions, and waste, enabling industries, researchers, and policymakers to identify hotspots for sustainability improvements. By providing a comprehensive assessment of systems, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal, LCA facilitates the development of environmentally sound strategies, thereby contributing significantly to sustainable engineering and informed decision-making. Despite its strengths and ubiquitous use, life cycle analysis has not been reconciled with the broader literature in model-based systems engineering and analysis, thus hindering its integration into the design of complex systems more generally. This lack of reconciliation poses a significant problem, as it hinders the seamless integration of environmental sustainability into the design and optimization of complex systems. Without alignment between life cycle analysis (LCA) and model-based systems engineering (MBSE), sustainability remains an isolated consideration rather than an inherent part of the system's architecture and design. The original contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper reconciles process-based life cycle analysis with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory. It ultimately proves that model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory are a formal generalization of process-based life cycle analysis. Secondly, the paper demonstrates how model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory may be used to enhance the spatio-temporal resolution of process-based life cycle analysis in a manner that aligns with system design objectives.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

This work provides a review of Bayesian nonparametric clustering methods, with a particular focus on their application to spatio-temporal data, which are ubiquitous in environmental sciences. We first introduce key modeling approaches for point-referenced spatio-temporal data, highlighting their flexibility in capturing complex spatial and temporal dependencies. We then review recent advancements in Bayesian clustering, focusing on spatial product partition models, which incorporate spatial structure into the clustering process. We illustrate the proposed methods on PM10 monitoring data from Northern Italy, demonstrating their ability to identify meaningful pollution patterns. This review highlights the potential of Bayesian nonparametric methods for environmental risk assessment and offers insights into future research directions in spatio-temporal clustering for public health and environmental science.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Guided Network with Cluster-Based Operators for Spatio-Spectral Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24605v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing a high-resolution hyperspectral image from a low-resolution multispectral observation. While spatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution have been extensively studied, joint spatio-spectral super-resolution remains relatively explored. We propose an end-to-end model-driven framework that explicitly decomposes the joint spatio-spectral super-resolution problem into spatial super-resolution, spectral super-resolution and fusion tasks. Each sub-task is addressed by unfolding a variational-based approach, where the operators involved in the proximal gradient iterative scheme are replaced with tailored learnable modules. In particular, we design an upsampling operator for spatial super-resolution based on classical back-projection algorithms, adapted to handle arbitrary scaling factors. Spectral reconstruction is performed using learnable cluster-based upsampling and downsampling operators. For image fusion, we integrate low-frequency estimation and high-frequency injection modules to combine the spatial and spectral information from spatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution outputs. Additionally, we introduce an efficient nonlocal post-processing step that leverages image self-similarity by combining a multi-head attention mechanism with residual connections. Extensive evaluations on several datasets and sampling factors demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

| **[Two-stage MCMC for Fast Bayesian Inference of Large Spatio-temporal Ordinal Data, with Application to US Drought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24594v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High dimensional space-time data pose known computational challenges when fitting spatio-temporal models. Such data show dependence across several dimensions of space as well as in time, and can easily involve hundreds of thousands of observations. Many spatio-temporal models result in a dependence structure across all observations and can be fit only at a substantial computational cost, arising from dense matrix inversion, high dimensional parameter spaces, poor mixing in Markov Chain Monte Carlo, or the impossibility of utilizing parallel computing due to a lack of independence anywhere in the model fitting process. These computational challenges are exacerbated when the response variable is ordinal, and especially as the number of ordered categories grows. Some spatio-temporal models achieve computational feasibility for large datasets but only through overly restrictive model simplifications, which we seek to avoid here. In this paper we demonstrate a two-stage algorithm to fit a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to large datasets when the response variable is ordinal. The first stage models locations independently in space, capturing temporal dependence, and can be run in parallel. The second stage resamples from the first stage posterior distributions with an acceptance probability computed to impose spatial dependence from the full spatio-temporal model. The result is fast Bayesian inference which samples from the full spatio-temporal posterior and is computationally feasible even for large datasets. We quantify the substantial computational gains our approach achieves, and demonstrate the preservation of the posterior distribution as compared to the more costly single-stage model fit. We apply our approach to a large spatio-temporal drought dataset in the United States, a dataset too large for many existing spatio-temporal methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing the Accuracy of Spatio-Temporal Models for Wind Speed Prediction by Incorporating Bias-Corrected Crowdsourced Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24506v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate high-resolution spatial and temporal wind speed data is critical for estimating the wind energy potential of a location. For real-time wind speed prediction, statistical models typically depend on high-quality (near) real-time data from official meteorological stations to improve forecasting accuracy. Personal weather stations (PWS) offer an additional source of real-time data and broader spatial coverage than offical stations. However, they are not subject to rigorous quality control and may exhibit bias or measurement errors. This paper presents a framework for incorporating PWS data into statistical models for validated official meteorological station data via a two-stage approach. First, bias correction is performed on PWS wind speed data using reanalysis data. Second, we implement a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model that accounts for varying measurement error in the PWS data. This enables wind speed prediction across a target area, and is particularly beneficial for improving predictions in regions sparse in official monitoring stations. Our results show that including bias-corrected PWS data improves prediction accuracy compared to using meteorological station data alone, with a 7% reduction in prediction error on average across all sites. The results are comparable with popular reanalysis products, but unlike these numerical weather models our approach is available in real-time and offers improved uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |

However, most current systems assume a static environment, which limits the system's applicability in real-world scenarios where environments frequently change due to human intervention or the robot's own actions. In this work, we present DynaMem, a new approach to open-world mobile manipulation that uses a dynamic spatio-semantic memory to represent a robot's environment. DynaMem constructs a 3D data structure to maintain a dynamic memory of point clouds, and answers open-vocabulary object localization queries using multimodal LLMs or open-vocabulary features generated by state-of-the-art vision-language models. Powered by DynaMem, our robots can explore novel environments, search for objects not found in memory, and continuously update the memory as objects move, appear, or disappear in the scene. We run extensive experiments on the Stretch SE3 robots in three real and nine offline scenes, and achieve an average pick-and-drop success rate of 70% on non-stationary objects, which is more than a 2x improvement over state-of-the-art static systems. Our code as well as our experiment and deployment videos are open sourced and can be found on our project website: https://dynamem.github.io/</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://dynamem.github.io</p></details> |
| **[STDR: Spatio-Temporal Decoupling for Real-Time Dynamic Scene Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22400v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although dynamic scene reconstruction has long been a fundamental challenge in 3D vision, the recent emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a promising direction by enabling high-quality, real-time rendering through explicit Gaussian primitives. However, existing 3DGS-based methods for dynamic reconstruction often suffer from \textit{spatio-temporal incoherence} during initialization, where canonical Gaussians are constructed by aggregating observations from multiple frames without temporal distinction. This results in spatio-temporally entangled representations, making it difficult to model dynamic motion accurately. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{STDR} (Spatio-Temporal Decoupling for Real-time rendering), a plug-and-play module that learns spatio-temporal probability distributions for each Gaussian. STDR introduces a spatio-temporal mask, a separated deformation field, and a consistency regularization to jointly disentangle spatial and temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating our module into existing 3DGS-based dynamic scene reconstruction frameworks leads to notable improvements in both reconstruction quality and spatio-temporal consistency across synthetic and real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust and Conjugate Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02450v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-space formulations allow for Gaussian process (GP) regression with linear-in-time computational cost in spatio-temporal settings, but performance typically suffers in the presence of outliers. In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</p></details> |  |
| **[NRFormer: Nationwide Nuclear Radiation Forecasting with Spatio-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11924v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nuclear radiation, which refers to the energy emitted from atomic nuclei during decay, poses significant risks to human health and environmental safety. Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against 11 baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 ADS Track</p></details> |
| **[Online distributed optimization for spatio-temporally constrained real-time peer-to-peer energy trading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21884v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of distributed renewable energy triggers the peer-to-peer (P2P) energy market formations. To make profits, prosumers equipped with photovoltaic (PV) panels and even the energy storage system (ESS) can actively participate in the real-time P2P energy market and trade energy. However, in real situations, system states such as energy demands and renewable energy power generation are highly uncertain, making it difficult for prosumers to make optimal real-time decisions. Moreover, severe problems with the physical network can arise from the real-time P2P energy trading, such as bus voltage violations and line overload. To handle these problems, this work first formulates the real-time P2P energy trading problem as a spatio-temporally constrained stochastic optimization problem by considering ESS and the spatial physical network constraints. To deal with the uncertainties online, a modified Lyapunov optimization method is innovatively proposed to approximately reformulate the stochastic optimization problem into an online one by relaxing the time-coupling constraints. Compared with the state-of-the-art online methods, the proposed one renders more flexibility and better performance for the real-time P2P energy market operation. Additionally, to protect the prosumers' privacy, an online distributed algorithm based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to solve the reformulated online problem by decoupling the spatial constraints. The theoretical near-optimal performance guarantee of the proposed online distributed algorithm is derived, and its performance can be further improved by minimizing the performance gap. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed online distributed algorithm can guarantee the fast, stable, and safe long-term operation of the real-time P2P energy market.</p></details> |  |
| **[STACI: Spatio-Temporal Aleatoric Conformal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21658v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fitting Gaussian Processes (GPs) provides interpretable aleatoric uncertainty quantification for estimation of spatio-temporal fields. Spatio-temporal deep learning models, while scalable, typically assume a simplistic independent covariance matrix for the response, failing to capture the underlying correlation structure. However, spatio-temporal GPs suffer from issues of scalability and various forms of approximation bias resulting from restrictive assumptions of the covariance kernel function. We propose STACI, a novel framework consisting of a variational Bayesian neural network approximation of non-stationary spatio-temporal GP along with a novel spatio-temporal conformal inference algorithm. STACI is highly scalable, taking advantage of GPU training capabilities for neural network models, and provides statistically valid prediction intervals for uncertainty quantification. STACI outperforms competing GPs and deep methods in accurately approximating spatio-temporal processes and we show it easily scales to datasets with millions of observations.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRAP: Spatio-Temporal Pattern Retrieval for Out-of-Distribution Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19547v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling dynamic graph-structured data across diverse domains. However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution (STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural, and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoupling Spatio-Temporal Prediction: When Lightweight Large Models Meet Adaptive Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19620v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction is a pivotal task with broad applications in traffic management, climate monitoring, energy scheduling, etc. However, existing methodologies often struggle to balance model expressiveness and computational efficiency, especially when scaling to large real-world datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose STH-SepNet (Spatio-Temporal Hypergraph Separation Networks), a novel framework that decouples temporal and spatial modeling to enhance both efficiency and precision. Therein, the temporal dimension is modeled using lightweight large language models, which effectively capture low-rank temporal dynamics. Concurrently, the spatial dimension is addressed through an adaptive hypergraph neural network, which dynamically constructs hyperedges to model intricate, higher-order interactions. A carefully designed gating mechanism is integrated to seamlessly fuse temporal and spatial representations. By leveraging the fundamental principles of low-rank temporal dynamics and spatial interactions, STH-SepNet offers a pragmatic and scalable solution for spatio-temporal prediction in real-world applications. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of STH-SepNet in boosting predictive performance while maintaining computational efficiency. This work may provide a promising lightweight framework for spatio-temporal prediction, aiming to reduce computational demands and while enhancing predictive performance.

| **[FutureSightDrive: Thinking Visually with Spatio-Temporal CoT for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17685v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual language models (VLMs) have attracted increasing interest in autonomous driving due to their powerful reasoning capabilities. However, existing VLMs typically utilize discrete text Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tailored to the current scenario, which essentially represents highly abstract and symbolic compression of visual information, potentially leading to spatio-temporal relationship ambiguity and fine-grained information loss. Is autonomous driving better modeled on real-world simulation and imagination than on pure symbolic logic? In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal CoT reasoning method that enables models to think visually. First, VLM serves as a world model to generate unified image frame for predicting future world states: where perception results (e.g., lane divider and 3D detection) represent the future spatial relationships, and ordinary future frame represent the temporal evolution relationships. This spatio-temporal CoT then serves as intermediate reasoning steps, enabling the VLM to function as an inverse dynamics model for trajectory planning based on current observations and future predictions. To implement visual generation in VLMs, we propose a unified pretraining paradigm integrating visual generation and understanding, along with a progressive visual CoT enhancing autoregressive image generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, advancing autonomous driving towards visual reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Spatio-Temporal Prediction: An Effective and Efficient Multi-Modal Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17637v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation, weather forecasting, and urban planning. While integrating multi-modal data has shown potential for enhancing prediction accuracy, key challenges persist: (i) inadequate fusion of multi-modal information, (ii) confounding factors that obscure causal relations, and (iii) high computational complexity of prediction models. To address these challenges, we propose E^2-CSTP, an Effective and Efficient Causal multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Prediction framework. E^2-CSTP leverages cross-modal attention and gating mechanisms to effectively integrate multi-modal data. Building on this, we design a dual-branch causal inference approach: the primary branch focuses on spatio-temporal prediction, while the auxiliary branch mitigates bias by modeling additional modalities and applying causal interventions to uncover true causal dependencies. To improve model efficiency, we integrate GCN with the Mamba architecture for accelerated spatio-temporal encoding. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world datasets show that E^2-CSTP significantly outperforms 9 state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 9.66% improvements in accuracy as well as 17.37%-56.11% reductions in computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLEX: A Backbone for Diffusion-Based Modeling of Spatio-temporal Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17351v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce FLEX (FLow EXpert), a backbone architecture for generative modeling of spatio-temporal physical systems using diffusion models. FLEX operates in the residual space rather than on raw data, a modeling choice that we motivate theoretically, showing that it reduces the variance of the velocity field in the diffusion model, which helps stabilize training. FLEX integrates a latent Transformer into a U-Net with standard convolutional ResNet layers and incorporates a redesigned skip connection scheme. This hybrid design enables the model to capture both local spatial detail and long-range dependencies in latent space. To improve spatio-temporal conditioning, FLEX uses a task-specific encoder that processes auxiliary inputs such as coarse or past snapshots. Weak conditioning is applied to the shared encoder via skip connections to promote generalization, while strong conditioning is applied to the decoder through both skip and bottleneck features to ensure reconstruction fidelity. FLEX achieves accurate predictions for super-resolution and forecasting tasks using as few as two reverse diffusion steps. It also produces calibrated uncertainty estimates through sampling. Evaluations on high-resolution 2D turbulence data show that FLEX outperforms strong baselines and generalizes to out-of-distribution settings, including unseen Reynolds numbers, physical observables (e.g., fluid flow velocity fields), and boundary conditions.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have opened a new frontier by fusing visual and linguistic modalities, enabling spatio-temporal vision-language understanding: models that not only capture spatial and temporal dependencies to recognize changes but also provide a richer interactive semantic analysis of temporal images (e.g., generate descriptive captions and answer natural-language queries). In this survey, we present the first comprehensive review of RS-STVLMs. The survey covers the evolution of models from early task-specific models to recent general foundation models that leverage powerful large language models. We discuss progress in representative tasks, such as change captioning, change question answering, and change grounding. Moreover, we systematically dissect the fundamental components and key technologies underlying these models, and review the datasets and evaluation metrics that have driven the field. By synthesizing task-level insights with a deep dive into shared architectural patterns, we aim to illuminate current achievements and chart promising directions for future research in spatio-temporal vision-language understanding for remote sensing.

Accordingly, this work introduces a spatio-temporal analytical framework based on discrete-time Markov chains to analyze vessel movement patterns in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, emphasizing changes induced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We discretize the ocean space into hexagonal cells and construct mobility signatures for individual vessel types using the frequency of cell transitions and the dwell time within each cell. These features are used to build origin-destination matrices and spatial transition probability models that characterize vessel dynamics at different temporal resolutions. Under multiple vessel types, we contribute with a temporal evolution analysis of mobility patterns during pandemic times, highlighting significant but transient changes to recurring transportation behaviors. Our findings indicate vessel-specific mobility signatures consistent across spatially disjoint regions, suggesting that those are latent behavioral invariants. Besides, we observe significant temporal deviations among passenger and fishing vessels during the pandemic, indicating a strong influence of social isolation policies and operational limitations imposed on non-essential maritime activity in this region.</p></details> |  |

Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, conference</p></details> |

While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Joint Conference on Neural Networks(IJCNN), 2015</p></details> |

This sparse characteristic presents challenges for their direct use in GPS-based systems. This paper addresses the task of map-constrained trajectory recovery, aiming to enhance trajectory sampling rates of GPS trajectories. Previous studies commonly adopt a sequence-to-sequence framework, where an encoder captures the trajectory patterns and a decoder reconstructs the target trajectory. Within this framework, effectively representing the road network and extracting relevant trajectory features are crucial for overall performance. Despite advancements in these models, they fail to fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal dynamics present in both the trajectory and the road network. To overcome these limitations, we categorize the spatio-temporal dynamics of trajectory data into two distinct aspects: spatial-temporal traffic dynamics and trajectory dynamics. Furthermore, We propose TedTrajRec, a novel method for trajectory recovery. To capture spatio-temporal traffic dynamics, we introduce PD-GNN, which models periodic patterns and learns topologically aware dynamics concurrently for each road segment. For spatio-temporal trajectory dynamics, we present TedFormer, a time-aware Transformer that incorporates temporal dynamics for each GPS location by integrating closed-form neural ordinary differential equations into the attention mechanism. This allows TedFormer to effectively handle irregularly sampled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TedTrajRec.

Exploring a Differentiable Sparse Soft-Vector Quantization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03406v4)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in various fields and requires a careful balance between identifying subtle patterns and filtering out noise. Vector quantization (VQ) appears well-suited for this purpose, as it quantizes input vectors into a set of codebook vectors or patterns. Although VQ has shown promise in various computer vision tasks, it surprisingly falls short in enhancing the accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting. We attribute this to two main issues: inaccurate optimization due to non-differentiability and limited representation power in hard-VQ. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Differentiable Sparse Soft-Vector Quantization (SVQ), the first VQ method to enhance spatio-temporal forecasting. SVQ balances detail preservation with noise reduction, offering full differentiability and a solid foundation in sparse regression. Our approach employs a two-layer MLP and an extensive codebook to streamline the sparse regression process, significantly cutting computational costs while simplifying training and improving performance. Empirical studies on five spatio-temporal benchmark datasets show SVQ achieves state-of-the-art results, including a 7.9% improvement on the WeatherBench-S temperature dataset and an average mean absolute error reduction of 9.4% in video prediction benchmarks (Human3.6M, KTH, and KittiCaltech), along with a 17.3% enhancement in image quality (LPIPS).

However, existing FCL methods face challenges of both spatial data heterogeneity among distributed clients and temporal data heterogeneity across online tasks. Such data heterogeneity significantly degrades the model performance with severe spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting of local and past knowledge. In this paper, we identify that the root cause of this issue lies in the inherent vulnerability and sensitivity of gradients to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a gradient-free method, named Analytic Federated Continual Learning (AFCL), by deriving analytical (i.e., closed-form) solutions from frozen extracted features. In local training, our AFCL enables single-epoch learning with only a lightweight forward-propagation process for each client. In global aggregation, the server can recursively and efficiently update the global model with single-round aggregation. Theoretical analyses validate that our AFCL achieves spatio-temporal invariance of non-IID data. This ideal property implies that, regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across local clients and online tasks, the aggregated model of our AFCL remains invariant and identical to that of centralized joint learning. Extensive experiments show the consistent superiority of our AFCL over state-of-the-art baselines across various benchmark datasets and settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Recent research on traffic forecasting has mainly focused on combining graph neural networks (GNNs) with other models. However, GNNs only consider short-range spatial information. In this study, we present a novel model termed LSTAN-GERPE (Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with Graph Embedding and Rotational Position Encoding). This model leverages both Temporal and Spatial Attention mechanisms to effectively capture long-range traffic dynamics. Additionally, the optimal frequency for rotational position encoding is determined through a grid search approach in both the spatial and temporal attention mechanisms. This systematic optimization enables the model to effectively capture complex traffic patterns. The model also enhances feature representation by incorporating geographical location maps into the spatio-temporal embeddings. Without extensive feature engineering, the proposed method in this paper achieves advanced accuracy on the real-world traffic forecasting datasets PeMS04 and PeMS08.</p></details> |  |
| **[ListenNet: A Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network for Auditory Attention Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10348v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to identify the direction of the attended speaker in multi-speaker environments from brain signals, such as Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, existing EEG-based AAD methods overlook the spatio-temporal dependencies of EEG signals, limiting their decoding and generalization abilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network (ListenNet) for AAD. The ListenNet has three key components: Spatio-temporal Dependency Encoder (STDE), Multi-scale Temporal Enhancement (MSTE), and Cross-Nested Attention (CNA). The STDE reconstructs dependencies between consecutive time windows across channels, improving the robustness of dynamic pattern extraction. The MSTE captures temporal features at multiple scales to represent both fine-grained and long-range temporal patterns. In addition, the CNA integrates hierarchical features more effectively through novel dynamic attention mechanisms to capture deep spatio-temporal correlations. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of ListenNet over state-of-the-art methods in both subject-dependent and challenging subject-independent settings, while reducing the trainable parameter count by approximately 7 times.

In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 19 figures.

| **[Beyond Pixels: Leveraging the Language of Soccer to Improve Spatio-Temporal Action Detection in Broadcast Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09455v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art spatio-temporal action detection (STAD) methods show promising results for extracting soccer events from broadcast videos. However, when operated in the high-recall, low-precision regime required for exhaustive event coverage in soccer analytics, their lack of contextual understanding becomes apparent: many false positives could be resolved by considering a broader sequence of actions and game-state information. In this work, we address this limitation by reasoning at the game level and improving STAD through the addition of a denoising sequence transduction task. Sequences of noisy, context-free player-centric predictions are processed alongside clean game state information using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model. By modeling extended temporal context and reasoning jointly over team-level dynamics, our method leverages the "language of soccer" - its tactical regularities and inter-player dependencies - to generate "denoised" sequences of actions. This approach improves both precision and recall in low-confidence regimes, enabling more reliable event extraction from broadcast video and complementing existing pixel-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, submitted to Advanced Concepts for Intelligent Vision Systems 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Monotonic Modeling with Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Awareness in Diverse Marketing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14132v2)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the mobile internet era, the Online Food Ordering Service (OFOS) emerges as an integral component of inclusive finance owing to the convenience it brings to people. OFOS platforms offer dynamic allocation incentives to users and merchants through diverse marketing campaigns to encourage payments while maintaining the platforms' budget efficiency. Despite significant progress, the marketing domain continues to face two primary challenges: (i) how to allocate a limited budget with greater efficiency, demanding precision in predicting users' monotonic response (i.e. sensitivity) to incentives, and (ii) ensuring spatio-temporal adaptability and robustness in diverse marketing campaigns across different times and locations. To address these issues, we propose a Constrained Monotonic Adaptive Network (CoMAN) method for spatio-temporal perception within marketing pricing. Specifically, we capture spatio-temporal preferences within attribute features through two foundational spatio-temporal perception modules. To further enhance catching the user sensitivity differentials to incentives across varied times and locations, we design modules for learning spatio-temporal convexity and concavity as well as for expressing sensitivity functions. CoMAN can achieve a more efficient allocation of incentive investments during pricing, thus increasing the conversion rate and orders while maintaining budget efficiency. Extensive offline and online experimental results within our diverse marketing campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while outperforming the monotonic state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[USTEP: Spatio-Temporal Predictive Learning under A Unified View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05829v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal predictive learning plays a crucial role in self-supervised learning, with wide-ranging applications across a diverse range of fields. Previous approaches for temporal modeling fall into two categories: recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods. The former, while meticulously processing frames one by one, neglect short-term spatio-temporal information redundancies, leading to inefficiencies. The latter naively stack frames sequentially, overlooking the inherent temporal dependencies. In this paper, we re-examine the two dominant temporal modeling approaches within the realm of spatio-temporal predictive learning, offering a unified perspective. Building upon this analysis, we introduce USTEP (Unified Spatio-TEmporal Predictive learning), an innovative framework that reconciles the recurrent-based and recurrent-free methods by integrating both micro-temporal and macro-temporal scales. Extensive experiments on a wide range of spatio-temporal predictive learning demonstrate that USTEP achieves significant improvements over existing temporal modeling approaches, thereby establishing it as a robust solution for a wide range of spatio-temporal applications.</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |

However, most existing learning-based methods for event-based optical flow adopt frame-based techniques, ignoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of events. Additionally, these methods assume linear motion between consecutive events within the loss time window, which increases optical flow errors in long-time sequences. In this work, we observe that rich spatio-temporal information and accurate nonlinear motion between events are crucial for event-based optical flow estimation. Therefore, we propose E-NMSTFlow, a novel unsupervised event-based optical flow network focusing on long-time sequences. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Motion Feature Aware (STMFA) module and an Adaptive Motion Feature Enhancement (AMFE) module, both of which utilize rich spatio-temporal information to learn spatio-temporal data associations. Meanwhile, we propose a nonlinear motion compensation loss that utilizes the accurate nonlinear motion between events to improve the unsupervised learning of our network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Remarkably, our method ranks first among unsupervised learning methods on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets.

The objective of the presented systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and over 150 journal papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive collection of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in future studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of the results of current spatio-temporal GNN models in different domains. In addition, in its final part this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions often rely on a pre-alignment strategy to normalize data, which can distort intrinsic patterns and escalate computational and memory demands. Addressing these limitations, we introduce STRGCN, a Spatio-Temporal Relational Graph Convolutional Network that avoids pre-alignment and directly captures the complex interdependencies in IMTS by representing them as a fully connected graph. Each observation is represented as a node, allowing the model to effectively handle misaligned timestamps by mapping all inter-node relationships, thus faithfully preserving the asynchronous nature of the data. Moreover, we enhance this model with a hierarchical ``Sandwich'' structure that strategically aggregates nodes to optimize graph embeddings, reducing computational overhead while maintaining detailed local and global context. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that STRGCN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, competitive memory usage and training speed.</p></details> |  |

Our approach combines a LiDAR-RGB fusion module for 3D fruit localization with a 4D fruit association method leveraging positional, visual, and topology information for improved data association precision. Evaluated on real orchard data, our method achieves a 96.9% fruit counting accuracy for 1,790 apples across 60 trees, a mean fruit size estimation error of 1.1 cm, and a 23.7% improvement in 4D data association precision over baselines.

Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/jegp/nrf</p></details> |

Accurate predictive models rely on high-resolution spatio-temporal data to capture the complex interplay of environmental and anthropogenic factors. To address the lack of localised and fine-grained datasets in Spain, this work introduces IberFire, a spatio-temporal datacube at 1 km x 1 km x 1-day resolution covering mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands from December 2007 to December 2024. IberFire integrates 260 features across eight main categories: auxiliary features, fire history, geography, topography, meteorology, vegetation indices, human activity, and land cover. All features are derived from open-access sources, ensuring transparency and real-time applicability. The data processing pipeline was implemented entirely using open-source tools, and the codebase has been made publicly available. This work not only enhances spatio-temporal granularity and feature diversity compared to existing European datacubes but also provides a reproducible methodology for constructing similar datasets. IberFire supports advanced wildfire risk modelling through Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, enables climate pattern analysis and informs strategic planning in fire prevention and land management. The dataset is publicly available on Zenodo to promote open research and collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal data fusion of censored threshold exceedances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20268v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data fusion models are widely used in air quality monitoring to integrate in situ and remote-sensing data, offering spatially complete and temporally detailed estimates. However, traditional Gaussian-based models often underestimate extreme pollution values, leading to biased risk assessments. To address this, we present a Bayesian hierarchical data fusion framework rooted in extreme value theory, using the Dirac-delta generalised Pareto distribution to jointly account for threshold and non-threshold exceedances while preserving the temporal structure of extreme events. Our model is used to describe and predict censored threshold exceedances of PM2.5 pollution in the Greater London region by using remote sensing observations from the EAC4 dataset, a reanalysis product from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS), and in situ observation stations from the automatic urban and rural network (AURN) ran by the UK government. Some of our approach's key innovations include combining data with varying spatio-temporal resolutions and fully accounting for parameter uncertainties. Results show that our model outperforms Gaussian-based alternatives and standalone remote-sensing data in predicting threshold exceedances at the majority of observation sites and can even result in improved spatial patterns of PM2.5 pollution than those discernible from the remote-sensing data. Moreover, our approach captures greater variability and spatial patterns, such as higher PM2.5 concentrations near coastal areas, which are not evident in remote-sensing data alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[3DPyranet Features Fusion for Spatio-temporal Feature Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18977v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural network (CNN) slides a kernel over the whole image to produce an output map. This kernel scheme reduces the number of parameters with respect to a fully connected neural network (NN). While CNN has proven to be an effective model in recognition of handwritten characters and traffic signal sign boards, etc. recently, its deep variants have proven to be effective in similar as well as more challenging applications like object, scene and action recognition. Deep CNN add more layers and kernels to the classical CNN, increasing the number of parameters, and partly reducing the main advantage of CNN which is less parameters. In this paper, a 3D pyramidal neural network called 3DPyraNet and a discriminative approach for spatio-temporal feature learning based on it, called 3DPyraNet-F, are proposed. 3DPyraNet introduces a new weighting scheme which learns features from both spatial and temporal dimensions analyzing multiple adjacent frames and keeping a biological plausible structure. It keeps the spatial topology of the input image and presents fewer parameters and lower computational and memory costs compared to both fully connected NNs and recent deep CNNs. 3DPyraNet-F extract the features maps of the highest layer of the learned network, fuse them in a single vector, and provide it as input in such a way to a linear-SVM classifier that enhances the recognition of human actions and dynamic scenes from the videos. Encouraging results are reported with 3DPyraNet in real-world environments, especially in the presence of camera induced motion. Further, 3DPyraNet-F clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art on three benchmark datasets and shows comparable result for the fourth.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often fail to incorporate adequate spatio-temporal modeling and prompt alignment within a unified framework, resulting in temporal inconsistencies, geometric distortions, or low-quality 4D content that deviates from the provided texts. Therefore, we propose STP4D, a novel approach that aims to integrate comprehensive spatio-temporal-prompt consistency modeling for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Specifically, STP4D employs three carefully designed modules: Time-varying Prompt Embedding, Geometric Information Enhancement, and Temporal Extension Deformation, which collaborate to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, STP4D is among the first methods to exploit the Diffusion model to generate 4D Gaussians, combining the fine-grained modeling capabilities and the real-time rendering process of 4DGS with the rapid inference speed of the Diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STP4D excels in generating high-fidelity 4D content with exceptional efficiency (approximately 4.6s per asset), surpassing existing methods in both quality and speed.</p></details> |  |

Multi-sensor synchronous measurement has proven to be more effective for WHAR than using a single sensor. However, existing WHAR methods use shared convolutional kernels for indiscriminate temporal feature extraction across each sensor variable, which fails to effectively capture spatio-temporal relationships of intra-sensor and inter-sensor variables. We propose the DecomposeWHAR model consisting of a decomposition phase and a fusion phase to better model the relationships between modality variables. The decomposition creates high-dimensional representations of each intra-sensor variable through the improved Depth Separable Convolution to capture local temporal features while preserving their unique characteristics. The fusion phase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and fusing their features at both the channel and variable levels. Long-range temporal dependencies are modeled using the State Space Model (SSM), and later cross-sensor interactions are dynamically captured through a self-attention mechanism, highlighting inter-sensor spatial correlations. Our model demonstrates superior performance on three widely used WHAR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 3D segmentation models solely focus on spatial information. To address this gap, we propose OmniMamba4D, a novel segmentation model designed for 4D medical images (3D images over time). OmniMamba4D utilizes a spatio-temporal tetra-orientated Mamba block to effectively capture both spatial and temporal features. Unlike traditional 3D models, which analyze single-time points, OmniMamba4D processes 4D CT data, providing comprehensive spatio-temporal information on lesion progression. Evaluated on an internal dataset comprising of 3,252 CT scans, OmniMamba4D achieves a competitive Dice score of 0.682, comparable to state-of-the-arts (SOTA) models, while maintaining computational efficiency and better detecting disappeared lesions.

However, the inherent nonlinearity of the marine dynamic system presents significant challenges. Current forecasting methods mainly include physics-based numerical simulations and data-driven machine learning approaches. The former, while describing SST evolution through differential equations, suffers from high computational complexity and limited applicability, whereas the latter, despite its computational benefits, requires large datasets and faces interpretability challenges. This study presents a prediction framework based solely on data-driven techniques. Using phase space reconstruction, we construct initial-delay attractor pairs with a mathematical homeomorphism and design a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Mapping (STFM) to uncover their intrinsic connections. Unlike conventional models, our method captures SST dynamics efficiently through phase space reconstruction and achieves high prediction accuracy with minimal training data in comparative tests</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures |

However, the low resolution of TIR images, along with tracking interference, significantly limits the perfor-mance of TIR trackers. To address these challenges, we introduce STARS, a novel sparse learning-based CF tracker that incorporates spatio-temporal regulari-zation and super-resolution reconstruction. First, we apply adaptive sparse filter-ing and temporal domain filtering to extract key features of the target while reduc-ing interference from background clutter and noise. Next, we introduce an edge-preserving sparse regularization method to stabilize target features and prevent excessive blurring. This regularization integrates multiple terms and employs the alternating direction method of multipliers to optimize the solution. Finally, we propose a gradient-enhanced super-resolution method to extract fine-grained TIR target features and improve the resolution of TIR images, addressing performance degradation in tracking caused by low-resolution sequences. To the best of our knowledge, STARS is the first to integrate super-resolution methods within a sparse learning-based CF framework. Extensive experiments on the LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR2017 benchmarks demonstrate that STARS outperforms state-of-the-art trackers in terms of robustness.</p></details> |  |

Among EEG techniques, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is favored due to its robust signal-to-noise ratio, minimal training demands, and elevated information transmission rate. Frequency detection in SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces commonly employs canonical correlation analysis (CCA). SSCCA (spatio-spectral canonical correlation analysis) augments CCA by refining spatial filtering. This paper presents a multistage feature fusion methodology for short-duration SSVEP frequency identification, employing SSCCA with template signals derived via leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). A filterbank generates bandpass filters for stimulus frequencies and their harmonics, whereas SSCCA calculates correlation coefficients between subbands and templates. Two phases of non-linear weighting amalgamate these coefficients to discern the target stimulus. This multistage methodology surpasses traditional techniques, attaining a accuracy of 94.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is presented in the Undergraduate Conference on Intelligent Computing and Systems (UCICS 2025) organised by Varendra University, Rajshahi, Bangladesh, 2025</p></details> |

However, similar to most RGBT fusion tasks, it still mainly relies on manually aligned multimodal image pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Multimodal Spatio-temporal Graph learning Network (MSGNet) for alignment-free RGBT VOD problem by leveraging the robust graph representation learning model. Specifically, we first design an Adaptive Partitioning Layer (APL) to estimate the corresponding regions of the Thermal image within the RGB image (high-resolution), achieving a preliminary inexact alignment. Then, we introduce the Spatial Sparse Graph Learning Module (S-SGLM) which employs a sparse information passing mechanism on the estimated inexact alignment to achieve reliable information interaction between different modalities. Moreover, to fully exploit the temporal cues for RGBT VOD problem, we introduce Hybrid Structured Temporal Modeling (HSTM), which involves a Temporal Sparse Graph Learning Module (T-SGLM) and Temporal Star Block (TSB). T-SGLM aims to filter out some redundant information between adjacent frames by employing the sparse aggregation mechanism on the temporal graph. Meanwhile, TSB is dedicated to achieving the complementary learning of local spatial relationships. Extensive comparative experiments conducted on both the aligned dataset VT-VOD50 and the unaligned dataset UVT-VOD2024 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

An effective load consolidation plan relies on carefully chosen consolidation points to ensure alignment with existing transportation management processes, such as driver scheduling, personnel planning, and terminal operations. This complexity represents a significant challenge when searching for optimal consolidation strategies. Traditional optimization-based methods provide exact solutions, but their computational complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances and they fail to leverage historical data. Machine learning-based approaches address these issues but often ignore operational constraints, leading to infeasible consolidation plans. This work proposes SPOT, an end-to-end approach that integrates the benefits of machine learning (ML) and optimization for load consolidation. The ML component plays a key role in the planning phase by identifying the consolidation points through spatio-temporal clustering and constrained frequent itemset mining, while the optimization selects the most cost-effective feasible consolidation routes for a given operational day. Extensive experiments conducted on industrial load data demonstrate that SPOT significantly reduces travel distance and transportation costs (by about 50% on large terminals) compared to the existing industry-standard load planning strategy and a neighborhood-based heuristic. Moreover, the ML component provides valuable tactical-level insights by identifying frequently recurring consolidation opportunities that guide proactive planning. In addition, SPOT is computationally efficient and can be easily scaled to accommodate large transportation networks.</p></details> |  |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

The key challenge of accurate prediction is how to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and adapt to the inherent dynamics in data. Traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) often struggle with static adjacency matrices that introduce domain bias or learnable matrices that may be overfitting to specific patterns. This challenge becomes more complex when considering Multi-Task Learning (MTL). While MTL has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy through task synergies, it can also face significant hurdles due to task interference. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a novel MTL framework, Dynamic Group-wise Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task Learning (DG-STMTL). DG-STMTL proposes a hybrid adjacency matrix generation module that combines static matrices with dynamic ones through a task-specific gating mechanism. We also introduce a group-wise GCN module to enhance the modelling capability of spatio-temporal dependencies. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate our method. Results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-arts, indicating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and model will be released at https://github.com/Jayce1kk/SpaceVLLM.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> |  |

Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |

Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.</p></details> | 6 pages |

We would like to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. Thus, we propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address these challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance (in terms of an f-divergence) between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.09482</p></details> |
| **[Towards Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control through Spatio-temporal Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11014v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are integral to intelligent traffic management, fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatio-temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent urban traffic management solutions.

Decoding covert speech from electroencephalogram (EEG) is challenging due to a limited understanding of neural pronunciation mapping and the low signal-to-noise ratio of the signal. In this study, we developed a large-scale multi-utterance speech EEG dataset from 57 right-handed native English-speaking subjects, each performing covert and overt speech tasks by repeating the same word in five utterances within a ten-second duration. Given the spatio-temporal nature of the neural activation process during speech pronunciation, we developed a Functional Areas Spatio-temporal Transformer (FAST), an effective framework for converting EEG signals into tokens and utilizing transformer architecture for sequence encoding. Our results reveal distinct and interpretable speech neural features by the visualization of FAST-generated activation maps across frontal and temporal brain regions with each word being covertly spoken, providing new insights into the discriminative features of the neural representation of covert speech. This is the first report of such a study, which provides interpretable evidence for speech decoding from EEG.

| **[DRAN: A Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network for Spatio-temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01531v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems' states are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. To address non-stationarity frameworks, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, we develop a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module that enables the normalization and de-normalization process in spatio-temporal systems. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state of the art methods in weather prediction and traffic flows forecasting tasks. Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes. Moreover, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of ``data-governance-analytics-decision.'' We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on the ``AGREE'' principles: Automation, Generalization, Robustness, Explainability, and Efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions.

However, the inherently sparse and non-deterministic nature of radar data limits the effectiveness of traditional single-frame BEV paradigms. In this paper, we addresses this limitation by introducing AttentiveGRU, a novel attention-based recurrent approach tailored for radar constraints, which extracts individualized spatio-temporal context for objects by dynamically identifying and fusing temporally correlated structures across present and memory states. By leveraging the consistency of object's latent representation over time, our approach exploits temporal relations to enrich feature representations for both stationary and moving objects, thereby enhancing detection performance and eliminating the need for externally providing or estimating any information about ego vehicle motion. Our experimental results on the public nuScenes dataset show a significant increase in mAP for the car category by 21% over the best radar-only submission. Further evaluations on an additional dataset demonstrate notable improvements in object detection capabilities, underscoring the applicability and effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, SNN possess a crucial characteristic, namely the ability to process spatio-temporal information. However, this ability is constrained by both internal and external factors in practical applications, thereby affecting the performance of SNN. Firstly, the internal issue of SNN lies in the inherent limitations of their network structure and neuronal model, which result in the network adopting a unified processing approach for information of different temporal dimensions when processing input data containing complex temporal information. Secondly, the external issue of SNN stems from the direct encoding method commonly adopted by directly trained SNN, which uses the same feature map for input at each time step, failing to fully exploit the spatio-temporal characteristics of SNN. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Unconstrained Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ULIF) neuronal model that allows for learning different membrane potential parameters at different time steps, thereby enhancing SNN' ability to process information of different temporal dimensions. Additionally, this paper presents a hybrid encoding scheme aimed at solving the problem of direct encoding lacking temporal dimension information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively improve the overall performance of SNN in object detection and object recognition tasks. related code is available at https://github.com/hhx0320/ASNN.</p></details> |  |

Despite its success, existing Mamba-based vision models have overlooked the nuances of event-driven tasks, especially in video reconstruction. Event-based video reconstruction (EBVR) demands spatial translation invariance and close attention to local event relationships in the spatio-temporal domain. Unfortunately, conventional Mamba algorithms apply static window partitions and standard reshape scanning methods, leading to significant losses in local connectivity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EventMamba--a specialized model designed for EBVR tasks. EventMamba innovates by incorporating random window offset (RWO) in the spatial domain, moving away from the restrictive fixed partitioning. Additionally, it features a new consistent traversal serialization approach in the spatio-temporal domain, which maintains the proximity of adjacent events both spatially and temporally. These enhancements enable EventMamba to retain Mamba's robust modeling capabilities while significantly preserving the spatio-temporal locality of event data. Comprehensive testing on multiple datasets shows that EventMamba markedly enhances video reconstruction, drastically improving computation speed while delivering superior visual quality compared to Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability.

The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.</p></details> |  |

Built upon the powerful Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, JavisDiT is able to generate high-quality audio and video content simultaneously from open-ended user prompts. To ensure optimal synchronization, we introduce a fine-grained spatio-temporal alignment mechanism through a Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Synchronized Prior (HiST-Sypo) Estimator. This module extracts both global and fine-grained spatio-temporal priors, guiding the synchronization between the visual and auditory components.

However, existing multi-sensor fusion research predominantly integrates complementary context from multiple images rather than videos. This primarily stems from two factors: 1) the scarcity of large-scale multi-sensor video datasets, limiting research in video fusion, and 2) the inherent difficulty of jointly modeling spatial and temporal dependencies in a unified framework. This paper proactively compensates for the dilemmas. First, we construct M3SVD, a benchmark dataset with $220$ temporally synchronized and spatially registered infrared-visible video pairs comprising 153,797 frames, filling the data gap for the video fusion community. Secondly, we propose VideoFusion, a multi-modal video fusion model that fully exploits cross-modal complementarity and temporal dynamics to generate spatio-temporally coherent videos from (potentially degraded) multi-modal inputs. Specifically, 1) a differential reinforcement module is developed for cross-modal information interaction and enhancement, 2) a complete modality-guided fusion strategy is employed to adaptively integrate multi-modal features, and 3) a bi-temporal co-attention mechanism is devised to dynamically aggregate forward-backward temporal contexts to reinforce cross-frame feature representations. Extensive experiments reveal that VideoFusion outperforms existing image-oriented fusion paradigms in sequential scenarios, effectively mitigating temporal inconsistency and interference.</p></details> |  |

VT migration is an effective way that migrates the VT when the locations of physical entities keep changing to maintain seamless immersive VT services. However, an efficient VT migration is challenging due to the rapid movement of vehicles, dynamic workloads of Roadside Units (RSUs), and heterogeneous resources of the RSUs. To achieve efficient migration decisions and a minimum latency for the VT migration, we propose a multi-agent split Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework combined with spatio-temporal trajectory generation. In this framework, multiple split DRL agents utilize split architecture to efficiently determine VT migration decisions. Furthermore, we propose a spatio-temporal trajectory generation algorithm based on trajectory datasets and road network data to simulate vehicle trajectories, enhancing the generalization of the proposed scheme for managing VT migration in dynamic network environments. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only enhances the Quality of Experience (QoE) by 29% but also reduces the computational parameter count by approximately 25% while maintaining similar performances, enhancing users' immersive experiences in vehicular metaverses.</p></details> |  |

Our approach combines Bayesian Structural Time Series for modeling marginal crop yields, ensuring a more robust quantification of uncertainty given the typically short historical records. To capture dynamic dependencies between regions, we develop a time-varying conditional copula model, where the copula parameter evolves over time as a function of its previous lag and extreme weather covariates. Unlike traditional approaches that treat climatic factors as fixed inputs, we incorporate dynamic Generalized Extreme Value models to characterize extreme weather events, enabling a more accurate reflection of their impact on crop yields. Furthermore, to ensure scalability for large-scale applications, we build on the existing Partitioning Around Medoids clustering algorithm and introduce a novel dissimilarity measure that integrates both spatial and copula-based dependence, enabling an effective reduction of the dimensionality in the dependence structure.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches face a trilemma: diffusion-based methods achieve high visual fidelity but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while GAN-based solutions sacrifice lip-sync accuracy or dental details for real-time performance. We present MuseTalk, a novel two-stage training framework that resolves this trade-off through latent space optimization and spatio-temporal data sampling strategy. Our key innovations include: (1) During the Facial Abstract Pretraining stage, we propose Informative Frame Sampling to temporally align reference-source pose pairs, eliminating redundant feature interference while preserving identity cues. (2) In the Lip-Sync Adversarial Finetuning stage, we employ Dynamic Margin Sampling to spatially select the most suitable lip-movement-promoting regions, balancing audio-visual synchronization and dental clarity. (3) MuseTalk establishes an effective audio-visual feature fusion framework in the latent space, delivering 30 FPS output at 256*256 resolution on an NVIDIA V100 GPU. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MuseTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity while achieving comparable lip-sync accuracy. %The codes and models will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Recent advances have improved the spatial reasoning ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing large-scale data, but these models still struggle to analyze kinematic elements like traveled distance and speed of moving objects. To bridge this gap, we construct a spatio-temporal reasoning dataset and benchmark involving kinematic instruction tuning, referred to as STKit and STKit-Bench. They consist of real-world videos with 3D annotations, detailing object motion dynamics: traveled distance, speed, movement direction, inter-object distance comparisons, and relative movement direction. To further scale such data construction to videos without 3D labels, we propose an automatic pipeline to generate pseudo-labels using 4D reconstruction in real-world scale. With our kinematic instruction tuning data for spatio-temporal reasoning, we present ST-VLM, a VLM enhanced for spatio-temporal reasoning, which exhibits outstanding performance on STKit-Bench. Furthermore, we show that ST-VLM generalizes robustly across diverse domains and tasks, outperforming baselines on other spatio-temporal benchmarks (eg, ActivityNet, TVQA+).

To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages loss masking and curriculum learning to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Unlike prior methods that add extra architectural components to learn unbiased estimators, we propose an impartial training objective that reduces the dominance of head classes during learning and focuses on underrepresented tail relationships. Our curriculum-driven mask generation strategy further empowers the model to adaptively adjust its bias mitigation strategy over time, enabling more balanced and robust estimations. To thoroughly assess performance under various distribution shifts, we also introduce two new tasks Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation offering a challenging benchmark for evaluating the resilience of STSG models. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate the superior unbiased performance and robustness of our method compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Compared to its predecessor SV4D, SV4D 2.0 is more robust to occlusions and large motion, generalizes better to real-world videos, and produces higher-quality outputs in terms of detail sharpness and spatio-temporal consistency. We achieve this by introducing key improvements in multiple aspects: 1) network architecture: eliminating the dependency of reference multi-views and designing blending mechanism for 3D and frame attention, 2) data: enhancing quality and quantity of training data, 3) training strategy: adopting progressive 3D-4D training for better generalization, and 4) 4D optimization: handling 3D inconsistency and large motion via 2-stage refinement and progressive frame sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance gain by SV4D 2.0 both visually and quantitatively, achieving better detail (-14\% LPIPS) and 4D consistency (-44\% FV4D) in novel-view video synthesis and 4D optimization (-12\% LPIPS and -24\% FV4D) compared to SV4D.

However, relation modeling between different image patches exhibits significant variations. For instance, background regions dominated by target-irrelevant information require reduced attention allocation, while foreground, particularly boundary areas, need to be be emphasized. A single model may not effectively handle all kinds of relation modeling simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel tracker called SPMTrack based on mixture-of-experts tailored for visual tracking task (TMoE), combining the capability of multiple experts to handle diverse relation modeling more flexibly. Benefiting from TMoE, we extend relation modeling from image pairs to spatio-temporal context, further improving tracking accuracy with minimal increase in model parameters. Moreover, we employ TMoE as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, substantially reducing trainable parameters, which enables us to train SPMTrack of varying scales efficiently and preserve the generalization ability of pretrained models to achieve superior performance. We conduct experiments on seven datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers.

Despite its importance, conventional LVEF estimation remains time-consuming and operator-dependent. Recent deep learning advancements have enhanced automation, yet many existing models are computationally demanding, hindering their feasibility for real-time clinical applications. Additionally, the interplay between spatial and temporal features is crucial for accurate estimation but is often overlooked. In this work, we propose Echo-E$^3$Net, an efficient Endo-Epi spatio-temporal network tailored for LVEF estimation. Our method introduces the Endo-Epi Cardial Border Detector (E$^2$CBD) module, which enhances feature extraction by leveraging spatial and temporal landmark cues. Complementing this, the Endo-Epi Feature Aggregator (E$^2$FA) distills statistical descriptors from backbone feature maps, refining the final EF prediction. These modules, along with a multi-component loss function tailored to align with the clinical definition of EF, collectively enhance spatial-temporal representation learning, ensuring robust and efficient EF estimation. We evaluate Echo-E$^3$Net on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, achieving a RMSE of 5.15 and an R$^2$ score of 0.82, setting a new benchmark in efficiency with 6.8 million parameters and only 8.49G Flops. Our model operates without pre-training, data augmentation, or ensemble methods, making it well-suited for real-time point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) applications.

| **[Whenever, Wherever: Towards Orchestrating Crowd Simulations with Spatio-Temporal Spawn Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16639v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic crowd simulations are essential for immersive virtual environments, relying on both individual behaviors (microscopic dynamics) and overall crowd patterns (macroscopic characteristics). While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Predictors in the Presence of Missing and Heterogeneous Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01701v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning approaches achieve outstanding predictive performance in modeling modern data, despite the increasing complexity and scale. However, evaluating the quality of predictive models becomes more challenging, as traditional statistical assumptions often no longer hold. In particular, spatio-temporal data exhibit dependencies across both time and space, often involving nonlinear dynamics, non-stationarities, and missing observations. As a result, advanced predictors such as spatio-temporal graph neural networks require novel evaluation methodologies. This paper introduces a residual correlation analysis framework designed to assess the optimality of spatio-temporal predictive neural models, particularly in scenarios with incomplete and heterogeneous data. By leveraging the principle that residual correlation indicates information not captured by the model, this framework serves as a powerful tool to identify and localize regions in space and time where model performance can be improved. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to operate under minimal assumptions, enabling robust evaluation of deep learning models applied to multivariate time series, even in the presence of missing and heterogeneous data. The methodology employs tailored spatio-temporal graphs to encode sparse spatial and temporal dependencies within the data and utilizes asymptotically distribution-free summary statistics to pinpoint time intervals and spatial regions where the model underperforms. The effectiveness of the proposed residual analysis is demonstrated through validation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios involving state-of-the-art predictive models.</p></details> |  |

However, existing pretrained models either do not support covariates or fail to incorporate them effectively. We introduce COSMIC, a zero-shot forecasting model that utilizes covariates via in-context learning. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose Informative Covariate Augmentation, which enables the training of COSMIC without requiring any datasets that include covariates. COSMIC achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot forecasting, both with and without covariates. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis demonstrates that COSMIC effectively leverages covariates in zero-shot forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was written at the end of 2024</p></details> |

TalkingMachines enables natural conversational experiences by integrating an audio large language model (LLM) with our video generation foundation model. Our primary contributions include: (1) We adapt a pretrained SOTA image-to-video DiT into an audio-driven avatar generation model of 18 billion parameters; (2) We enable infinite video streaming without error accumulation through asymmetric knowledge distillation from a bidirectional teacher model into a sparse causal, autoregressive student model; (3) We design a high-throughput, low-latency inference pipeline incorporating several key engineering optimizations such as: (a) disaggregation of the DiT and VAE decoder across separate devices, (b) efficient overlap of inter-device communication and computation using CUDA streams, (c) elimination of redundant recomputations to maximize frame-generation throughput.

However, the plethora of model formulations, the inconsistent use of terminology, and the various inferential approaches and software packages can be overwhelming to practitioners, especially when they are new to this area. With this review-like paper, we thus aim to provide guidance for both statisticians and practitioners working with latent Markov models by offering a unifying view on what otherwise are often considered separate model classes, from hidden Markov models over state-space models to Markov-modulated Poisson processes. In particular, we provide a roadmap for identifying a suitable latent Markov model formulation given the data to be analysed. Furthermore, we emphasise that it is key to applied work with any of these model classes to understand how recursive techniques exploiting the models' dependence structure can be used for inference. The R package LaMa adapts this unified view and provides an easy-to-use framework for very fast (C++ based) numerical maximum likelihood estimation of any of the models discussed in this paper, allowing users to tailor a latent Markov model to their data using a Lego-type approach.</p></details> | 52 pages, 7 figures |
| **[LEG-SLAM: Real-Time Language-Enhanced Gaussian Splatting for SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03073v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Gaussian Splatting methods have proven highly effective for real-time photorealistic rendering of 3D scenes. However, integrating semantic information into this representation remains a significant challenge, especially in maintaining real-time performance for SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) applications. In this work, we introduce LEG-SLAM -- a novel approach that fuses an optimized Gaussian Splatting implementation with visual-language feature extraction using DINOv2 followed by a learnable feature compressor based on Principal Component Analysis, while enabling an online dense SLAM. Our method simultaneously generates high-quality photorealistic images and semantically labeled scene maps, achieving real-time scene reconstruction with more than 10 fps on the Replica dataset and 18 fps on ScanNet. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction speed while achieving competitive rendering quality. The proposed system eliminates the need for prior data preparation such as camera's ego motion or pre-computed static semantic maps. With its potential applications in autonomous robotics, augmented reality, and other interactive domains, LEG-SLAM represents a significant step forward in real-time semantic 3D Gaussian-based SLAM.

Solving a quantum computational problem with such variational methods relies on minimising some cost function, e.g., the energy of a physical system. As such, this is similar to the training process in machine learning and variational quantum simulations can therefore suffer from similar problems encountered in machine learning training. This includes non-convergence to the global minimum due to local minima as well as critical slowing down. In this article, we analyse the imaginary time evolution as a means of compiling parametric quantum circuits and finding optimal parameters, and show that it guarantees convergence to the global minimum without critical slowing down. We also show that the compilation process, including the task of finding optimal parameters, can be performed efficiently up to an arbitrary error threshold if the underlying physical system is of bounded order. This includes many relevant computational problems, e.g., local physical theories and combinatorial optimisation problems such as the flight-to-gate assignment problem. In particular, we show a priori estimates on the success probability for these combinatorial optimisation problems. There seem to be no known classical methods with similar efficiency and convergence guarantees. Meanwhile the imaginary time evolution method can be implemented on current quantum computers.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, their robustness to adversarial manipulation remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the adversarial vulnerabilities of tabular FM, focusing on both their fragility to targeted test-time attacks and their potential misuse as adversarial tools. We show on three benchmarks in finance, cybersecurity and healthcare, that small, structured perturbations to test inputs can significantly degrade prediction accuracy, even when training context remain fixed. Additionally, we demonstrate that tabular FM can be repurposed to generate transferable evasion to conventional models such as random forests and XGBoost, and on a lesser extent to deep tabular models. To improve tabular FM, we formulate the robustification problem as an optimization of the weights (adversarial fine-tuning), or the context (adversarial in-context learning). We introduce an in-context adversarial training strategy that incrementally replaces the context with adversarial perturbed instances, without updating model weights. Our approach improves robustness across multiple tabular benchmarks. Together, these findings position tabular FM as both a target and a source of adversarial threats, highlighting the urgent need for robust training and evaluation practices in this emerging paradigm.</p></details> |  |

Firstly, the basic information and transaction data of popular NFTs on the Solana chain are collected using the Selenium tool. Secondly, the transaction records of the Magic Eden trading market are thoroughly analyzed by combining them with the Scrapy framework to examine the price fluctuations and market trends of NFTs. In terms of data analysis, this paper employs time series analysis to examine the dynamics of the NFT market and seeks to identify potential price patterns. In addition, the risk and return of different NFTs are evaluated using the mean-variance optimization model, taking into account their characteristics, such as illiquidity and market volatility, to provide investors with data-driven portfolio recommendations. The experimental results show that the combination of crawler technology and financial analytics can effectively analyze NFT data on the Solana blockchain and provide timely market insights and investment strategies. This study provides a reference for further exploration in the field of digital currencies.</p></details> |  |

Existing CTTA methods mostly focus on adaptation to the current test domain only, overlooking generalization to arbitrary test domains a model may face in the future. To tackle this limitation, we present a novel online test-time domain generalization framework for CTTA, dubbed TestDG. TestDG aims to learn features invariant to both current and previous test domains on the fly during testing, improving the potential for effective generalization to future domains. To this end, we propose a new model architecture and a test-time adaptation strategy dedicated to learning domain-invariant features, along with a new data structure and optimization algorithm for effectively managing information from previous test domains. TestDG achieved state of the art on four public CTTA benchmarks. Moreover, it showed superior generalization to unseen test domains.</p></details> |  |

However, its performance suffers under arbitrarily heterogeneous computation times across workers, leading to suboptimal time complexity and inefficiency as the number of workers scales. While several Asynchronous SGD variants have been proposed, recent findings by Tyurin & Richt\'arik (NeurIPS 2023) reveal that none achieve optimal time complexity, leaving a significant gap in the literature. In this paper, we propose Ringmaster ASGD, a novel Asynchronous SGD method designed to address these limitations and tame the inherent challenges of Asynchronous SGD. We establish, through rigorous theoretical analysis, that Ringmaster ASGD achieves optimal time complexity under arbitrarily heterogeneous and dynamically fluctuating worker computation times. This makes it the first Asynchronous SGD method to meet the theoretical lower bounds for time complexity in such scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, rendering city-scale 3DGS scenes on mobile devices, e.g., your smartphones, remains a significant challenge due to the limited resources on mobile devices. A natural solution is to offload computation to the cloud; however, naively streaming rendered frames from the cloud to the client introduces high latency and requires bandwidth far beyond the capacity of current wireless networks. In this paper, we propose an effective solution to enable city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Our key insight is that, under normal user motion, the number of newly visible Gaussians per second remains roughly constant. Leveraging this, we stream only the necessary Gaussians to the client. Specifically, on the cloud side, we propose asynchronous level-of-detail search to identify the necessary Gaussians for the client. On the client side, we accelerate rendering via a lookup table-based rasterization. Combined with holistic runtime optimizations, our system can deliver low-latency, city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Compared to existing solutions, Voyager achieves over 100$\times$ reduction on data transfer and up to 8.9$\times$ speedup while retaining comparable rendering quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Binary Cumulative Encoding meets Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24595v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in time series forecasting have explored formulating regression via classification task. By discretizing the continuous target space into bins and predicting over a fixed set of classes, these approaches benefit from stable training, robust uncertainty modeling, and compatibility with modern deep learning architectures. However, most existing methods rely on one-hot encoding that ignores the inherent ordinal structure of the underlying values. As a result, they fail to provide information about the relative distance between predicted and true values during training. In this paper, we propose to address this limitation by introducing binary cumulative encoding (BCE), that represents scalar targets into monotonic binary vectors. This encoding implicitly preserves order and magnitude information, allowing the model to learn distance-aware representations while still operating within a classification framework. We propose a convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for BCE, incorporating residual and dilated convolutions to enable fast and expressive temporal modeling. Through extensive experiments on benchmark forecasting datasets, we show that our approach outperforms widely used methods in both point and probabilistic forecasting, while requiring fewer parameters and enabling faster training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-time sparse attention with asymmetric indexing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08246v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-attention in transformer models is an incremental associative memory that maps key vectors to value vectors. One way to speed up self-attention is to employ GPU-compatible vector search algorithms based on standard partitioning methods such as k-means. However, such partitioning methods yield poor results in this context because (1) the keys and queries follow different distributions, and (2) the RoPE positional encoding hinders the bucket assignment. This paper introduces Saap (Self-Attention with Asymmetric Partitions), which overcomes these problems. It is an asymmetrical indexing technique that employs distinct partitions for keys and queries, thereby approximating self-attention with a data-adaptive sparsity pattern. It works on pretrained language models and only requires to train (offline) a small query classifier. On a long context Llama 3.1-8b model, with sequences ranging from 100k to 500k tokens, Saap typically reduces by a factor of 20 the fraction of memory that needs to be looked-up, which translates to a time saving of 60\% when compared to FlashAttention-v2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Soft Sparse Shapes for Efficient Time-Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06892v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shapelets are discriminative subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time series classification. Due to the time-intensive nature of shapelet discovery, existing shapelet-based methods mainly focus on selecting discriminative shapes while discarding others to achieve candidate subsequence sparsification. However, this approach may exclude beneficial shapes and overlook the varying contributions of shapelets to classification performance. To this end, we propose a Soft sparse Shapes (SoftShape) model for efficient time series classification. Our approach mainly introduces soft shape sparsification and soft shape learning blocks. The former transforms shapes into soft representations based on classification contribution scores, merging lower-scored ones into a single shape to retain and differentiate all subsequence information. The latter facilitates intra- and inter-shape temporal pattern learning, improving model efficiency by using sparsified soft shapes as inputs. Specifically, we employ a learnable router to activate a subset of class-specific expert networks for intra-shape pattern learning. Meanwhile, a shared expert network learns inter-shape patterns by converting sparsified shapes into sequences. Extensive experiments show that SoftShape outperforms state-of-the-art methods and produces interpretable results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[XicorAttention: Time Series Transformer Using Attention with Nonlinear Correlation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02694v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various Transformer-based models have been proposed for time series forecasting. These models leverage the self-attention mechanism to capture long-term temporal or variate dependencies in sequences. Existing methods can be divided into two approaches: (1) reducing computational cost of attention by making the calculations sparse, and (2) reshaping the input data to aggregate temporal features. However, existing attention mechanisms may not adequately capture inherent nonlinear dependencies present in time series data, leaving room for improvement. In this study, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on Chatterjee's rank correlation coefficient, which measures nonlinear dependencies between variables. Specifically, we replace the matrix multiplication in standard attention mechanisms with this rank coefficient to measure the query-key relationship. Since computing Chatterjee's correlation coefficient involves sorting and ranking operations, we introduce a differentiable approximation employing SoftSort and SoftRank. Our proposed mechanism, ``XicorAttention,'' integrates it into several state-of-the-art Transformer models. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that incorporating nonlinear correlation into the attention improves forecasting accuracy by up to approximately 9.1\% compared to existing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small Aid, Big Leap: Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models with AdaptNet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02671v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing the generalization capability of vision-language models (VLMs) during inference. However, existing approaches often incur substantial computational costs and exhibit poor scalability, primarily due to sample-wise adaptation granularity and reliance on costly auxiliary designs such as data augmentation. To address these limitations, we introduce SAIL (Small Aid, Big Leap), a novel adapter-based TTA framework that leverages a lightweight, learnable AdaptNet to enable efficient and scalable model adaptation. As SAIL's core, a frozen pre-trained VLM collaborates with AdaptNet through a confidence-based interpolation weight, generating robust predictions during inference. These predictions serve as self-supervised targets to align AdaptNet's outputs through efficient batch-wise processing, dramatically reducing computational costs without modifying the VLM or requiring memory caches. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting during continual adaptation, we propose a gradient-aware reset strategy driven by a gradient drift indicator (GDI), which dynamically detects domain transitions and strategically resets AdaptNet for stable adaptation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks on two scenarios demonstrate that SAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low computational costs. These results highlight SAIL's effectiveness, efficiency and scalability for real-world deployment. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Our method features (i) a reformulation of INSE so that the velocity divergence decays exponentially on the coarsest level, (ii) a derivation of coarse-fine interface conditions that preserves the decay of velocity divergence on any refinement level of the AMR hierarchy, (iii) an approximation of the coarse-fine interface conditions via spatiotemporal interpolations to facilitate subcycling in time, (iv) enforcing to machine precision solvability conditions of elliptic equations over each connected component of the subdomain covered by any refinement level, (v) a composite projection for synchronizing multiple levels, and (vi) geometric multigrid for solving linear systems with optimal complexity. Different from current block-structured AMR algorithms, our method never adopts refluxing at the coarse-fine interface, nor is fine-to-coarse averaging applied to projected velocities. Results of numerical tests demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present OmniTalker, a unified framework that jointly generates synchronized talking audio-video content from input text while emulating the speaking and facial movement styles of the target identity, including speech characteristics, head motion, and facial dynamics. Our framework adopts a dual-branch diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture, with one branch dedicated to audio generation and the other to video synthesis. At the shallow layers, cross-modal fusion modules are introduced to integrate information between the two modalities. In deeper layers, each modality is processed independently, with the generated audio decoded by a vocoder and the video rendered using a GAN-based high-quality visual renderer. Leveraging the in-context learning capability of DiT through a masked-infilling strategy, our model can simultaneously capture both audio and visual styles without requiring explicit style extraction modules. Thanks to the efficiency of the DiT backbone and the optimized visual renderer, OmniTalker achieves real-time inference at 25 FPS. To the best of our knowledge, OmniTalker is the first one-shot framework capable of jointly modeling speech and facial styles in real time. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing methods in terms of generation quality, particularly in preserving style consistency and ensuring precise audio-video synchronization, all while maintaining efficient inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page https://humanaigc.github.io/omnitalker</p></details> |

However, due to the temporal variations and dynamic spatial correlations of traffic data, traffic prediction remains highly challenging.Traditional spatiotemporal networks, which rely on end-to-end training, often struggle to handle the diverse data dependencies of multiple traffic flow patterns. Additionally, traffic flow variations are highly sensitive to temporal information changes. Regrettably, other researchers have not sufficiently recognized the importance of temporal information.To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called A Time-Enhanced Data Disentanglement Network for Traffic Flow Forecasting (TEDDN). This network disentangles the originally complex and intertwined traffic data into stable patterns and trends. By flexibly learning temporal and node information through a dynamic graph enhanced by a temporal feature extraction module, TEDDN demonstrates significant efficacy in disentangling and extracting complex traffic information. Experimental evaluations and ablation studies on four real-world datasets validate the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |

Being available to users from diverse cultural backgrounds, large language models (LLMs) should also be able to provide accurate information irrespective of the measurement system at hand. Using newly compiled datasets we test if this is the case for seven open-source LLMs, addressing three key research questions: (RQ1) What is the default system used by LLMs for each type of measurement? (RQ2) Do LLMs' answers and their accuracy vary across different measurement systems? (RQ3) Can LLMs mitigate potential challenges w.r.t. underrepresented systems via reasoning? Our findings show that LLMs default to the measurement system predominantly used in the data. Additionally, we observe considerable instability and variance in performance across different measurement systems. While this instability can in part be mitigated by employing reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought (CoT), this implies longer responses and thereby significantly increases test-time compute (and inference costs), marginalizing users from cultural backgrounds that use underrepresented measurement systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main (Camera-Ready Version)</p></details> |
| **[SDE: A Simplified and Disentangled Dependency Encoding Framework for State Space Models in Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12068v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, advancements in deep learning have spurred the development of numerous models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). However, most existing approaches struggle to fully capture the complex and structured dependencies inherent in time series data. In this work, we identify and formally define three critical dependencies that are fundamental to forecasting accuracy: order dependency and semantic dependency along the temporal dimension, as well as cross-variate dependency across the feature dimension. These dependencies are often treated in isolation, and improper handling can introduce noise and degrade forecasting performance. To bridge this gap, we investigate the potential of State Space Models (SSMs) for LTSF and emphasize their inherent advantages in capturing these essential dependencies. Additionally, we empirically observe that excessive nonlinearity in conventional SSMs introduce redundancy when applied to semantically sparse time series data. Motivated by this insight, we propose SDE (Simplified and Disentangled Dependency Encoding), a novel framework designed to enhance the capability of SSMs for LTSF. Specifically, we first eliminate unnecessary nonlinearities in vanilla SSMs, thereby improving the suitability for time series forecasting. Building on this foundation, we introduce a disentangled encoding strategy, which empowers SSMs to efficiently model cross-variate dependencies while mitigating interference between the temporal and feature dimensions. Furthermore, we provide rigorous theoretical justifications to substantiate our design choices. Extensive experiments on nine real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that SDE-enhanced SSMs consistently outperform state-of-the-art time series forecasting models.Our code is available at https://github.com/YukinoAsuna/SAMBA.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

Most existing CTTA-OD methods prioritize effectiveness while overlooking computational efficiency, which is crucial for resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an efficient CTTA-OD method via pruning. Our motivation stems from the observation that not all learned source features are beneficial; certain domain-sensitive feature channels can adversely affect target domain performance. Inspired by this, we introduce a sensitivity-guided channel pruning strategy that quantifies each channel based on its sensitivity to domain discrepancies at both image and instance levels. We apply weighted sparsity regularization to selectively suppress and prune these sensitive channels, focusing adaptation efforts on invariant ones. Additionally, we introduce a stochastic channel reactivation mechanism to restore pruned channels, enabling recovery of potentially useful features and mitigating the risks of early pruning. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method achieves superior adaptation performance while reducing computational overhead by 12% in FLOPs compared to the recent SOTA method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as CVPR 2025 oral paper</p></details> |
| **[PAID: Pairwise Angular-Invariant Decomposition for Continual Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02453v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to online adapt a pre-trained model to changing environments during inference. Most existing methods focus on exploiting target data, while overlooking another crucial source of information, the pre-trained weights, which encode underutilized domain-invariant priors. This paper takes the geometric attributes of pre-trained weights as a starting point, systematically analyzing three key components: magnitude, absolute angle, and pairwise angular structure. We find that the pairwise angular structure remains stable across diverse corrupted domains and encodes domain-invariant semantic information, suggesting it should be preserved during adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose PAID (Pairwise Angular-Invariant Decomposition), a prior-driven CTTA method that decomposes weight into magnitude and direction, and introduces a learnable orthogonal matrix via Householder reflections to globally rotate direction while preserving the pairwise angular structure. During adaptation, only the magnitudes and the orthogonal matrices are updated. PAID achieves consistent improvements over recent SOTA methods on four widely used CTTA benchmarks, demonstrating that preserving pairwise angular structure offers a simple yet effective principle for CTTA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Univariate to Multivariate: LLMs as Zero-Shot Predictors for Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02389v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series prediction or forecasting is critical across many real-world dynamic systems, and recent studies have proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task due to their strong generalization capabilities and ability to perform well without extensive pre-training. However, their effectiveness in handling complex, noisy, and multivariate time-series data remains underexplored. To address this, we propose LLMPred which enhances LLM-based time-series prediction by converting time-series sequences into text and feeding them to LLMs for zero shot prediction along with two main data pre-processing techniques. First, we apply time-series sequence decomposition to facilitate accurate prediction on complex and noisy univariate sequences. Second, we extend this univariate prediction capability to multivariate data using a lightweight prompt-processing strategy. Extensive experiments with smaller LLMs such as Llama 2 7B, Llama 3.2 3B, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek 7B demonstrate that LLMPred achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a thorough ablation study highlights the importance of the key components proposed in LLMPred.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic real-time multi-UAV cooperative mission planning method under multiple constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02365v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As UAV popularity soars, so does the mission planning associated with it. The classical approaches suffer from the triple problems of decoupled of task assignment and path planning, poor real-time performance and limited adaptability. Aiming at these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamic real-time multi-UAV collaborative mission planning algorithm based on Dubins paths under a distributed formation structure. Dubins path with multiple advantages bridges the gap between task assignment and path planning, leading to a coupled solution for mission planning. Then, a series of acceleration techniques, task clustering preprocessing, highly efficient distance cost functions, low-complexity and less iterative task allocation strategies, are employed to guarantee the real-time performance of the algorithms. To cope with different emergencies and their simultaneous extremes, real-time planning of emerging tasks and mission replanning due to the reduction of available UAVs are appropriately handled. Finally, the developed algorithm is comprehensively exemplified and studied through simulations, highlighting that the proposed method only sacrifices 9.57% of the path length, while achieving a speed improvement of 4-5 orders of magnitude over the simulated annealing method, with a single mission planning of about 0.0003s.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Practical Linear Time Algorithm for Optimal Tree Decomposition of Halin Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02346v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes \textsc{H-Td}, a practical linear-time algorithm for computing an optimal-width tree decomposition of Halin graphs. Unlike state-of-the-art methods based on reduction rules or separators, \textsc{H-Td} exploits the structural properties of Halin graphs. Although two theoretical linear-time algorithms exist that can be applied to graphs of treewidth three, no practical implementation has been made publicly available. Furthermore, extending reduction-based approaches to partial $k$-trees with $k > 3$ results in increasingly complex rules that are challenging to implement. This motivates the exploration of alternative strategies that leverage structural insights specific to certain graph classes. Experimental validation against the winners of the Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge (PACE) 2017 and the treewidth library \texttt{libtw} demonstrates the advantage of \textsc{H-Td} when the input is known to be a Halin graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[De-Biasing Structure Function Estimates From Sparse Time Series of the Solar Wind: A Data-Driven Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10053v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structure functions, which represent the moments of the increments of a stochastic process, are essential complementary statistics to power spectra for analysing the self-similar behaviour of a time series. However, many real-world environmental datasets, such as those collected by spacecraft monitoring the solar wind, contain gaps, which inevitably corrupt the statistics. The nature of this corruption for structure functions remains poorly understood - indeed, often overlooked. Here we simulate gaps in a large set of magnetic field intervals from Parker Solar Probe in order to characterize the behaviour of the structure function of a sparse time series of solar wind turbulence. We quantify the resultant error with regards to the overall shape of the structure function, and its slope in the inertial range. Noting the consistent underestimation of the true curve when using linear interpolation, we demonstrate the ability of an empirical correction factor to de-bias these estimates. This correction, "learnt" from the data from a single spacecraft, is shown to generalize well to data from a solar wind regime elsewhere in the heliosphere, producing smaller errors, on average, for missing fractions >25%. Given this success, we apply the correction to gap-affected Voyager intervals from the inner heliosheath and local interstellar medium, obtaining spectral indices similar to those from previous studies. This work provides a tool for future studies of fragmented solar wind time series, such as those from Voyager, MAVEN, and OMNI, as well as sparsely-sampled astrophysical and geophysical processes more generally.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Performative Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06077v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting is a critical challenge in various domains and has witnessed substantial progress in recent years. Many real-life scenarios, such as public health, economics, and social applications, involve feedback loops where predictions can influence the predicted outcome, subsequently altering the target variable's distribution. This phenomenon, known as performativity, introduces the potential for 'self-negating' or 'self-fulfilling' predictions. Despite extensive studies in classification problems across domains, performativity remains largely unexplored in the context of time-series forecasting from a machine-learning perspective. In this paper, we formalize performative time-series forecasting (PeTS), addressing the challenge of accurate predictions when performativity-induced distribution shifts are possible. We propose a novel approach, Feature Performative-Shifting (FPS), which leverages the concept of delayed response to anticipate distribution shifts and subsequently predicts targets accordingly. We provide theoretical insights suggesting that FPS can potentially lead to reduced generalization error. We conduct comprehensive experiments using multiple time-series models on COVID-19 and traffic forecasting tasks. The results demonstrate that FPS consistently outperforms conventional time-series forecasting methods, highlighting its efficacy in handling performativity-induced challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (8 main text, 1 reference, 3 appendix), 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Search for Inference-Time Alignment in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02039v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown promising generative capabilities across diverse domains, yet aligning their outputs with desired reward functions remains a challenge, particularly in cases where reward functions are non-differentiable. Some gradient-free guidance methods have been developed, but they often struggle to achieve optimal inference-time alignment. In this work, we newly frame inference-time alignment in diffusion as a search problem and propose Dynamic Search for Diffusion (DSearch), which subsamples from denoising processes and approximates intermediate node rewards. It also dynamically adjusts beam width and tree expansion to efficiently explore high-reward generations. To refine intermediate decisions, DSearch incorporates adaptive scheduling based on noise levels and a lookahead heuristic function. We validate DSearch across multiple domains, including biological sequence design, molecular optimization, and image generation, demonstrating superior reward optimization compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

This review synthesizes recent progress in applying autoencoders and vision transformers for unsupervised signal analysis, focusing on their architectures, applications, and emerging trends. We explore how these models enable feature extraction, anomaly detection, and classification across diverse signal types, including electrocardiograms, radar waveforms, and IoT sensor data. The review highlights the strengths of hybrid architectures and self-supervised learning, while identifying challenges in interpretability, scalability, and domain generalization. By bridging methodological innovations and practical applications, this work offers a roadmap for developing robust, adaptive models for signal intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Early Detection of Patient Deterioration from Real-Time Wearable Monitoring System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01305v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early detection of patient deterioration is crucial for reducing mortality rates. Heart rate data has shown promise in assessing patient health, and wearable devices offer a cost-effective solution for real-time monitoring. However, extracting meaningful insights from diverse heart rate data and handling missing values in wearable device data remain key challenges. To address these challenges, we propose TARL, an innovative approach that models the structural relationships of representative subsequences, known as shapelets, in heart rate time series. TARL creates a shapelet-transition knowledge graph to model shapelet dynamics in heart rate time series, indicating illness progression and potential future changes. We further introduce a transition-aware knowledge embedding to reinforce relationships among shapelets and quantify the impact of missing values, enabling the formulation of comprehensive heart rate representations. These representations capture explanatory structures and predict future heart rate trends, aiding early illness detection. We collaborate with physicians and nurses to gather ICU patient heart rate data from wearables and diagnostic metrics assessing illness severity for evaluating deterioration. Experiments on real-world ICU data demonstrate that TARL achieves both high reliability and early detection. A case study further showcases TARL's explainable detection process, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven tool to assist clinicians in recognizing early signs of patient deterioration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evidence of equilibrium dynamics in human social networks evolving in time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11635v4)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How do networks of relationships evolve over time? We analyse a dataset tracking the social interactions of 900 individuals over four years. Despite continuous shifts in individual relationships, the macroscopic structural properties of the network remain stable, fluctuating within predictable bounds. We connect this stability to the concept of equilibrium in statistical physics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the probabilities governing network dynamics are stationary over time, and key features like degree, edge, and triangle abundances align with theoretical predictions from equilibrium dynamics. Moreover, the dynamics satisfies the detailed balance condition. Remarkably, equilibrium persists despite constant turnover as people join, leave, and change connections. This suggests that equilibrium arises not from specific individuals but from the balancing act of human needs, cognitive limits, and social pressures. Practically, this equilibrium simplifies data collection, supports methods relying on single network snapshots (like Exponential Random Graph Models), and aids in designing interventions for social challenges. Theoretically, it offers new insights into collective human behaviour, revealing how emergent properties of complex social systems can be captured by simple mathematical models.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

It differs from existing TSQA benchmarks by avoiding web-searchable queries grounded in the real world. We present a series of time-sensitive event scenarios based on synthetically generated facts. It requires large language models (LLMs) to engage in genuine temporal reasoning without depending on the factual knowledge acquired during the pre-training phase. Our data generation framework enables on-demand generation of new samples, mitigating the risk of data leakage. We designed three types of time-sensitive questions to test LLMs' temporal reasoning abilities over sequential and parallel event occurrences. Our evaluation of five LLMs on synthetic fact-based TSQA reveals mixed results: while they perform well on simpler subsets, their overall performance remains inferior as compared to real world fact-based TSQA. Error analysis indicates that LLMs face difficulties in reasoning over long-range event dependencies and parallel events.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |
| **[Real-time respiratory motion forecasting with online learning of recurrent neural networks for accurate targeting in externally guided radiotherapy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01607v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In lung radiotherapy, infrared cameras can track reflective objects on the chest to estimate tumor motion due to breathing, but treatment system latencies hinder radiation beam precision. Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) is a potential solution that can learn patterns within non-stationary respiratory data but has high complexity. This study assesses the capabilities of resource-efficient online RNN algorithms, namely unbiased online recurrent optimization (UORO), sparse-1 step approximation (SnAp-1), and decoupled neural interfaces (DNI) to forecast respiratory motion during radiotherapy treatment accurately. We use time series containing the 3D positions of external markers on the chest of healthy subjects. We propose efficient implementations for SnAp-1 and DNI that compress the influence and immediate Jacobian matrices and accurately update the linear coefficients used in credit assignment estimation, respectively. Data was originally sampled at 10Hz; we resampled it at 3.33Hz and 30Hz to analyze the effect of the sampling rate on performance. We use UORO, SnAp-1, and DNI to forecast each marker's 3D position with horizons h<=2.1s (the time interval in advance for which the prediction is made) and compare them with RTRL, least mean squares, kernel support vector regression, and linear regression. RNNs trained online achieved similar or better accuracy than most previous works using larger training databases and deep learning, even though we used only the first minute of each sequence to predict motion within that exact sequence. SnAp-1 had the lowest normalized root mean square errors (nRMSEs) averaged over the horizon values considered, equal to 0.335 and 0.157, at 3.33Hz and 10.0Hz, respectively. Similarly, UORO had the lowest nRMSE at 30Hz, equal to 0.086. DNI's inference time (6.8ms per time step at 30Hz, Intel Core i7-13700 CPU) was the lowest among the RNN methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 18 figures, accepted manuscript version</p></details> |
| **[The time scale of redundancy between prosody and linguistic context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11630v3)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In spoken communication, information is transmitted not only via words, but also through a rich array of non-verbal signals, including prosody--the non-segmental auditory features of speech. Do these different communication channels carry distinct information? Prior work has shown that the information carried by prosodic features is substantially redundant with that carried by the surrounding words. Here, we systematically examine the time scale of this relationship, studying how it varies with the length of past and future contexts. We find that a word's prosodic features require an extended past context (3-8 words across different features) to be reliably predicted. Given that long-scale contextual information decays in memory, prosody may facilitate communication by adding information that is locally unique. We also find that a word's prosodic features show some redundancy with future words, but only with a short scale of 1-2 words, consistent with reports of incremental short-term planning in language production. Thus, prosody may facilitate communication by helping listeners predict upcoming material. In tandem, our results highlight potentially distinct roles that prosody plays in facilitating integration of words into past contexts and in helping predict upcoming words.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, accepted to ACL.

| **[An inverse obstacle scattering problem with passive data in the time domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20697v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work considers a time domain inverse acoustic obstacle scattering problem due to passive data. Motivated by the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff identity in the frequency domain, we propose to relate the time domain measurement data in passive imaging to an approximate data set given by the subtraction of two scattered wave fields. We propose a time domain linear sampling method for the approximate data set and show how to tackle the measurement data in passive imaging. An imaging functional is built based on the linear sampling method, which reconstructs the support of the unknown scattering object using directly the time domain measurements. The functional framework is based on the Laplace transform, which relates the mapping properties of Laplace domain factorized operators to their counterparts in the time domain. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the capability of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

The competition idea is based on one of the real-life AI security threats identified within the project -- the adversarial poisoning of continuously fine-tuned satellite telemetry forecasting models. The task is to develop methods for finding and reconstructing triggers (trojans) in advanced models for satellite telemetry forecasting used in safety-critical space operations. Participants are provided with 1) a large public dataset of real-life multivariate satellite telemetry (without triggers), 2) a reference model trained on the clean data, 3) a set of poisoned neural hierarchical interpolation (N-HiTS) models for time series forecasting trained on the dataset with injected triggers, and 4) Jupyter notebook with the training pipeline and baseline algorithm (the latter will be published in the last month of the competition). The main task of the competition is to reconstruct a set of 45 triggers (i.e., short multivariate time series segments) injected into the training data of the corresponding set of 45 poisoned models. The exact characteristics (i.e., shape, amplitude, and duration) of these triggers must be identified by participants. The popular Neural Cleanse method is adopted as a baseline, but it is not designed for time series analysis and new approaches are necessary for the task. The impact of the competition is not limited to the space domain, but also to many other safety-critical applications of advanced time series analysis where model poisoning may lead to serious consequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Augmentation for Time-Series Classification: An Extensive Empirical Study and Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10060v7)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data Augmentation (DA) has become a critical approach in Time Series Classification (TSC), primarily for its capacity to expand training datasets, enhance model robustness, introduce diversity, and reduce overfitting. However, the current landscape of DA in TSC is plagued with fragmented literature reviews, nebulous methodological taxonomies, inadequate evaluative measures, and a dearth of accessible and user-oriented tools. This study addresses these challenges through a comprehensive examination of DA methodologies within the TSC domain.Our research began with an extensive literature review spanning a decade, revealing significant gaps in existing surveys and necessitating a detailed analysis of over 100 scholarly articles to identify more than 60 distinct DA techniques. This rigorous review led to the development of a novel taxonomy tailored to the specific needs of DA in TSC, categorizing techniques into five primary categories: Transformation-Based, Pattern-Based, Generative, Decomposition-Based, and Automated Data Augmentation. This taxonomy is intended to guide researchers in selecting appropriate methods with greater clarity. In response to the lack of comprehensive evaluations of foundational DA techniques, we conducted a thorough empirical study, testing nearly 20 DA strategies across 15 diverse datasets representing all types within the UCR time-series repository. Using ResNet and LSTM architectures, we employed a multifaceted evaluation approach, including metrics such as Accuracy, Method Ranking, and Residual Analysis, resulting in a benchmark accuracy of 84.98 +- 16.41% in ResNet and 82.41 +- 18.71% in LSTM. Our investigation underscored the inconsistent efficacies of DA techniques, for instance, methods like RGWs and Random Permutation significantly improved model performance, whereas others, like EMD, were less effective.</p></details> |  |

Existing routing models rely on learning the optimal routing decision from carefully curated data, require complex computations to be updated, and do not consider the potential evolution of weaker FMs. In this paper, we propose Real-time Adaptive Routing (RAR), an approach to continuously adapt FM routing decisions while using guided in-context learning to enhance the capabilities of weaker FM. The goal is to reduce reliance on stronger, more expensive FMs. We evaluate our approach on different subsets of the popular MMLU benchmark. Over time, our approach routes 50.2% fewer requests to computationally expensive models while maintaining around 90.5% of the general response quality. In addition, the guides generated from stronger models have shown intra-domain generalization and led to a better quality of responses compared to an equivalent approach with a standalone weaker FM.</p></details> |  |

Our result is a $0.5109$-approximation algorithm with a running time of $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{n})$. All previous algorithms either provide only a marginal improvement (e.g., $2^{-280}$) over the $0.5$-approximation that arises from estimating a \emph{maximal} matching, or have a running time that is nearly $n^2$. Our approach is also arguably much simpler than other algorithms beating $0.5$-approximation.</p></details> |  |

While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40.

| **[An Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Model for High-Dimensional Tensor-Valued Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01658v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autoregressive modeling for tensor-valued time series, Tucker decomposition, when applied to the coefficient tensor, provides a clear interpretation of supervised factor modeling but loses its efficiency rapidly with increasing tensor order. Conversely, canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition maintains efficiency but lacks a precise statistical interpretation. To attain both interpretability and powerful dimension reduction, this paper proposes a novel approach under the supervised factor modeling paradigm, which first uses CP decomposition to extract response and covariate features separately and then regresses response features on covariate ones. This leads to a new CP-based low-rank structure for the coefficient tensor. Furthermore, to address heterogeneous signals or potential model misspecifications arising from stringent low-rank assumptions, a low-rank plus sparse model is introduced by incorporating an additional sparse coefficient tensor. Nonasymptotic properties are established for the ordinary least squares estimators, and an alternating least squares algorithm is introduced for optimization. Theoretical properties of the proposed methodology are validated by simulation studies, and its enhanced prediction performance and interpretability are demonstrated by the El Ni$\tilde{\text{n}}$o-Southern Oscillation example.</p></details> |  |

Almost all related works are limited to data in Euclidean space. Although an attempt was made in 2011 to adapt this concept to unit quaternions, a general extension to Riemannian manifolds remains absent. Given its importance for numerous applications in robotics and beyond, we introduce Riemannian Time Warping~(RTW). This novel approach efficiently aligns multiple signals by considering the geometric structure of the Riemannian manifold in which the data is embedded. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including tests with an LBR iiwa robot, demonstrate that RTW consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both averaging and classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Causal-based Simulation for Realistic Time-series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02084v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal Discovery plays a pivotal role in revealing relationships among observed variables, particularly in the temporal setup. While the majority of CD methods rely on synthetic data for evaluation, and recently for training, these fall short in accurately mirroring real-world scenarios; an effect even more evident in temporal data. Generation techniques depending on simplified assumptions on causal structure, effects and time, limit the quality and diversity of the simulated data. In this work, we introduce Temporal Causal-based Simulation (TCS), a robust framework for generating realistic time-series data and their associated temporal causal graphs. The approach is structured in three phases: estimating the true lagged causal structure of the data, approximating the functional dependencies between variables and learning the noise distribution of the corresponding causal model, each part of which can be explicitly tailored based on data assumptions and characteristics. Through an extensive evaluation process, we highlight that single detection methods for generated data discrimination prove inadequate, accentuating it as a multifaceted challenge. For this, we detail a Min-max optimization phase that draws on AutoML techniques. Our contributions include a flexible, model-agnostic pipeline for generating realistic temporal causal data, a thorough evaluation setup which enhances the validity of the generated datasets and insights into the challenges posed by realistic data generation. Through experiments involving not only real but also semi-synthetic and purely synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that while sampling realistic causal data remains a complex task, our method enriches the domain of generating sensible causal-based temporal data.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |

However, their performances vary between different domains and tasks. In LLM-based approaches, test-time adaptation using example-based prompting has become common, owing to the high cost of retraining. In the context of anomaly detection, which is the focus of this study, providing normal examples from the target domain can also be effective. However, time series foundation models do not naturally acquire the ability to interpret or utilize examples or instructions, because the nature of time series data used during training does not encourage such capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval augmented time series foundation model (RATFM), which enables pretrained time series foundation models to incorporate examples of test-time adaptation. We show that RATFM achieves a performance comparable to that of in-domain fine-tuning while avoiding domain-dependent fine-tuning. Experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, a multi-domain dataset including nine domains, confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

Practical examples of non-ideal systems are considered. The most common phenomenon for this kind of system is discussed. The period considered is from 2020 to 2025. The specific properties of various models are also discussed. Directions for future investigations are provided. In this paper, the authors revisited some publications based on the assumption that the external excitations are produced by non-ideal sources (RNIS), that is, with limited power supply. Among these applications, nonlinear phenomena such as the Sommerfeld effect and saturation phenomenon were observed, considering fractional damping. Energy harvesters and the Jacobi-Anger expansion were used in the governing equations of motion. We also used the Jacobi-Anger expansion in the case of energy transfer between vibrating modes under an external force with time-varying frequency, which represents one of the future directions of research on non-ideal vibrating systems (RNIS).</p></details> | 6 figures, 35 pages |

The sequential nature of data collected from these environments has enabled improvements in Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models by processing time windows rather than treating the data as tabular. However, conventional explanation methods often neglect this temporal structure, leading to imprecise or less actionable explanations. This work presents ShaTS (Shapley values for Time Series models), which is a model-agnostic explainable Artificial Intelligence method designed to enhance the precision of Shapley value explanations for time series models. ShaTS addresses the shortcomings of traditional approaches by incorporating an a priori feature grouping strategy that preserves temporal dependencies and produces both coherent and actionable insights. Experiments conducted on the SWaT dataset demonstrate that ShaTS accurately identifies critical time instants, precisely pinpoints the sensors, actuators, and processes affected by anomalies, and outperforms SHAP in terms of both explainability and resource efficiency, fulfilling the real-time requirements of industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages;16 figures;Submitted to Elsevier (Information Fusion)</p></details> |

Commonly, agents are located on a graph and can traverse edges. This problem has many variations and has been studied for decades. Two such variations are the continuous-time and the lifelong MAPF problems. In the former, edges have non-unit lengths and volumetric agents can traverse them at any real-valued time. In the latter, agents must attend to a continuous stream of incoming tasks. Much work has been devoted to designing solution methods within these two areas. To our knowledge, however, the combined problem of continuous-time lifelong MAPF has yet to be addressed. This work addresses continuous-time lifelong MAPF with volumetric agents by presenting the fast and sub-optimal Continuous-time Prioritized Lifelong Planner (CPLP). CPLP continuously assigns agents to tasks and computes plans using a combination of two path planners; one based on CCBS and the other based on SIPP. Experimental results with up to 800 agents on graphs with up to 12 000 vertices demonstrate practical performance, where maximum planning times fall within the available time budget. Additionally, CPLP ensures collision-free movement even when failing to meet this budget. Therefore, the robustness of CPLP highlights its potential for real-world applications.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

Best-of-N reformulation over the generated candidates via prompting shows impressive potential scaling capability. However, both the previous tuning methods (training time) and adaptation approaches (test time) can not fully unleash their benefits. In this paper, we propose AdaRewriter, a novel framework for query reformulation using an outcome-supervised reward model via test-time adaptation. By training a lightweight reward model with contrastive ranking loss, AdaRewriter selects the most promising reformulation during inference. Notably, it can operate effectively in black-box systems, including commercial LLM APIs. Experiments on five conversational search datasets show that AdaRewriter significantly outperforms the existing methods across most settings, demonstrating the potential of test-time adaptation for conversational query reformulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeGraph: Synthetic Benchmark Datasets for Robust Time-Series Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01361v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust causal discovery in time series datasets depends on reliable benchmark datasets with known ground-truth causal relationships. However, such datasets remain scarce, and existing synthetic alternatives often overlook critical temporal properties inherent in real-world data, including nonstationarity driven by trends and seasonality, irregular sampling intervals, and the presence of unobserved confounders. To address these challenges, we introduce TimeGraph, a comprehensive suite of synthetic time-series benchmark datasets that systematically incorporates both linear and nonlinear dependencies while modeling key temporal characteristics such as trends, seasonal effects, and heterogeneous noise patterns. Each dataset is accompanied by a fully specified causal graph featuring varying densities and diverse noise distributions and is provided in two versions: one including unobserved confounders and one without, thereby offering extensive coverage of real-world complexity while preserving methodological neutrality. We further demonstrate the utility of TimeGraph through systematic evaluations of state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms including PCMCI+, LPCMCI, and FGES across a diverse array of configurations and metrics. Our experiments reveal significant variations in algorithmic performance under realistic temporal conditions, underscoring the need for robust synthetic benchmarks in the fair and transparent assessment of causal discovery methods. The complete TimeGraph suite, including dataset generation scripts, evaluation metrics, and recommended experimental protocols, is freely available to facilitate reproducible research and foster community-driven advancements in time-series causal discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, accepted at KDD 2025 (Datasets and Benchmarks Track)</p></details> |

Extreme Value Analysis (EVA)-based probabilistic assessments of annual peaks are widely adopted by energy regulatory and oversight agencies to determine the likelihood and severity of potential energy shortfalls. Due to the inability of classical EVA to account for peak distributions that change with annual extreme temperatures, popular existing approaches apply EVA on simulated annual peaks created by weather-dependent surrogate models using Mont\'e-Carlo simulations on a per-scenario basis. In higher time resolutions such as day-ahead scheduling, the daily peak demand changes upon various factors besides temperature, Mont\'e-Carlo experiments become intractable, and EVA-based modeling manifests as a methodological vacuum. This article explores uncharted territories and pioneers an unparalleled nonstationary EVA estimator that predicts the probable peaks of high-resolution time intervals and their corresponding conditional probability densities based on calendar information and weather conditions where historical peaks are observed. We present a case study on the determination of day-ahead scheduling capacity and demonstrate that compared to the industry approach, our approach results in a $38\%$ reduction in the yearly total committed capacity while maintaining the given risk requirement.</p></details> |  |

The length extrapolation capability in TF-domain dual-path models is a crucial factor, as it affects not only their performance on long-duration inputs but also their generalizability to signals with unseen sampling rates. While PE is known to significantly impact length extrapolation, there has been limited research that explores the choice of PEs for TF-domain dual-path models from this perspective. To address this gap, we compare various PE methods using a recent state-of-the-art model, TF-Locoformer, as the base architecture. Our analysis yields the following key findings: (i) When handling sequences that are the same length as or shorter than those seen during training, models with PEs achieve better performance. (ii) However, models without PE exhibit superior length extrapolation. This trend is particularly pronounced when the model contains convolutional layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 tables, 2 figures.

| **[$Ψ$-Sampler: Initial Particle Sampling for SMC-Based Inference-Time Reward Alignment in Score Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01320v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce $\Psi$-Sampler, an SMC-based framework incorporating pCNL-based initial particle sampling for effective inference-time reward alignment with a score-based generative model. Inference-time reward alignment with score-based generative models has recently gained significant traction, following a broader paradigm shift from pre-training to post-training optimization. At the core of this trend is the application of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to the denoising process. However, existing methods typically initialize particles from the Gaussian prior, which inadequately captures reward-relevant regions and results in reduced sampling efficiency. We demonstrate that initializing from the reward-aware posterior significantly improves alignment performance. To enable posterior sampling in high-dimensional latent spaces, we introduce the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm, which combines dimension-robust proposals with gradient-informed dynamics. This approach enables efficient and scalable posterior sampling and consistently improves performance across various reward alignment tasks, including layout-to-image generation, quantity-aware generation, and aesthetic-preference generation, as demonstrated in our experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSRating: Rating Quality of Diverse Time Series Data by Meta-learning from LLM Judgment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01290v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality time series (TS) data are essential for ensuring TS model performance, rendering research on rating TS data quality indispensable. Existing methods have shown promising rating accuracy within individual domains, primarily by extending data quality rating techniques such as influence functions and Shapley values to account for temporal characteristics. However, they neglect the fact that real-world TS data can span vastly different domains and exhibit distinct properties, hampering the accurate and efficient rating of diverse TS data. In this paper, we propose TSRating, a novel and unified framework for rating the quality of time series data crawled from diverse domains. TSRating is built on the assumption that LLMs inherit ample knowledge, acquired during their extensive pretraining, enabling them to comprehend and discern quality differences in diverse TS data. We verify this assumption by devising a series of prompts to elicit quality comparisons from LLMs for pairs of TS samples. We then fit a dedicated rating model, termed TSRater, to convert the LLMs' judgments into efficient quality predictions via TSRater's inference on future TS samples. To ensure cross-domain adaptability, we develop a meta-learning scheme to train TSRater on quality comparisons collected from nine distinct domains. To improve training efficiency, we employ signSGD for inner-loop updates, thus circumventing the demanding computation of hypergradients. Extensive experimental results on eleven benchmark datasets across three time series tasks, each using both conventional TS models and TS foundation models, demonstrate that TSRating outperforms baselines in terms of estimation accuracy, efficiency, and domain adaptability.</p></details> |  |

Temporal Heads: Where Language Models Recall Time-specific Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14258v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the ability of language models to elicit facts has been widely investigated, how they handle temporally changing facts remains underexplored. We discover Temporal Heads, specific attention heads that primarily handle temporal knowledge, through circuit analysis. We confirm that these heads are present across multiple models, though their specific locations may vary, and their responses differ depending on the type of knowledge and its corresponding years. Disabling these heads degrades the model's ability to recall time-specific knowledge while maintaining its general capabilities without compromising time-invariant and question-answering performances. Moreover, the heads are activated not only numeric conditions ("In 2004") but also textual aliases ("In the year ..."), indicating that they encode a temporal dimension beyond simple numerical representation. Furthermore, we expand the potential of our findings by demonstrating how temporal knowledge can be edited by adjusting the values of these heads.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the main conference at ACL 2025</p></details> |

The proposed approach employs Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to extract temporal modes directly from observed data, eliminating the need for explicit timestamps or hand-crafted time features. These temporal modes serve as time representations that can be seamlessly integrated into deep spatiotemporal forecasting models. Unlike conventional embeddings such as time-of-day indicators or sinusoidal functions, our method captures complex multi-scale periodicity through spectral analysis of spatiotemporal data. Extensive experiments on urban mobility, highway traffic, and climate datasets demonstrate that the DMD-based embedding consistently improves long-horizon forecasting accuracy, reduces residual correlation, and enhances temporal generalization. The method is lightweight, model-agnostic, and compatible with any architecture that incorporates time covariates.</p></details> |  |

Due to their high computational overhead, many approaches build such representations in advance of the task. However, when the task specifications change, such static approaches become inadequate as they may miss key objects, spatial relations, and details. We introduce GraphPad, a modifiable structured memory that an agent can tailor to the needs of the task through API calls. It comprises a mutable scene graph representing the environment, a navigation log indexing frame-by-frame content, and a scratchpad for task-specific notes. Together, GraphPad serves as a dynamic workspace that remains complete, current, and aligned with the agent's immediate understanding of the scene and its task. On the OpenEQA benchmark, GraphPad attains 55.3%, a +3.0% increase over an image-only baseline using the same vision-language model, while operating with five times fewer input frames. These results show that allowing online, language-driven refinement of 3-D memory yields more informative representations without extra training or data collection.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Workshop on 3D-LLM/VLA: Bridging Language, Vision and Action in 3D Environments</p></details> |

Hypothesis selection addresses the setting where, in addition to a sample set, we are given $n$ candidate distributions -- referred to as hypotheses -- and the goal is to determine which one best describes the underlying data distribution. This problem is known to be solvable very efficiently, requiring roughly $O(\log n)$ samples and running in $\tilde{O}(n)$ time. The quality of the output is measured via the total variation distance to the unknown distribution, and the approximation factor of the algorithm determines how large this distance is compared to the optimal distance achieved by the best candidate hypothesis. It is known that $\alpha = 3$ is the optimal approximation factor for this problem. We study hypothesis selection under the constraint of differential privacy. We propose a differentially private algorithm in the central model that runs in nearly-linear time with respect to the number of hypotheses, achieves the optimal approximation factor, and incurs only a modest increase in sample complexity, which remains polylogarithmic in $n$. This resolves an open question posed by [Bun, Kamath, Steinke, Wu, NeurIPS 2019]. Prior to our work, existing upper bounds required quadratic time.</p></details> | 33 pages |

Inspired by this, many people have been studying how to train models to achieve effective self-evaluation and self-correction to further enable the scaling paradigm. However, less studied is how to efficiently scale test-time compute from a fixed model, and this remains a challenge. In this paper, we address this challenge by focusing on enhancing the quality of self-reflection data generation for complex problem-solving at test time, which can also subsequently improve the training of next-generation large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we explore how systematically triggering a model's self-correction mechanisms can improve performance on challenging reasoning tasks. To this end, we propose a novel iterative deepening sampling algorithm framework designed to enhance self-correction and generate higher-quality samples. Through extensive experiments on Math500 and AIME benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method achieves a higher success rate on difficult tasks and provide detailed ablation studies to analyze its effectiveness across diverse settings.</p></details> |  |

Taking a clinical trial on Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) as an example, fluctuations or variabilities are common in HS-related endpoints, mainly due to the natural disease characteristics, variations of evaluation from different physicians, and standard of care evolvement. The adjustment of time-varying placebo effects receives some attention in adaptive clinical trials and platform trials, but is usually ignored in traditional non-adaptive designs. However, under the impact of such a time drift, some existing methods may not simultaneously control the type I error rate and achieve satisfactory power. In this article, we propose SWSR (Semiparametric Weighted Spline Regression) to estimate the treatment effect with B-splines to accommodate the time-varying placebo effects nonparametrically. Our method aims to achieve the following three objectives: a proper type I error rate control under varying settings, an overall high power to detect a potential treatment effect, and robustness to unknown time-varying placebo effects. Simulation studies and a case study provide supporting evidence. Those three key features make SWSR an appealing option to be pre-specified for practical confirmatory clinical trials. Supplemental materials, including the R code, additional simulation results and theoretical discussion, are available online.</p></details> |  |

Classical time series classification and deep learning techniques have demonstrated limited efficacy in monitoring PD symptoms using wearable accelerometer data due to complex PD movement patterns and the small size of available datasets. We investigate InceptionTime and RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform (ROCKET) as they are promising for PD symptom monitoring. InceptionTime's high learning capacity is well-suited to modeling complex movement patterns, while ROCKET is suited to small datasets. With random search methodology, we identify the highest-scoring InceptionTime architecture and compare its performance to ROCKET with a ridge classifier and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on wrist motion data from PD patients. Our findings indicate that all approaches can learn to estimate tremor severity and bradykinesia presence with moderate performance but encounter challenges in detecting dyskinesia. Among the presented approaches, ROCKET demonstrates higher scores in identifying dyskinesia, whereas InceptionTime exhibits slightly better performance in tremor and bradykinesia estimation. Notably, both methods outperform the multi-layer perceptron. In conclusion, InceptionTime can classify complex wrist motion time series and holds potential for continuous symptom monitoring in PD with further development.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code is available from https://github.com/cedricdonie/tsc-for-wrist-motion-pd-detection</p></details> |

With recent progress in large language models and time series learning, we revisit the integration of paired texts with time series through the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, which posits that representations of different modalities converge to shared spaces. In this context, we identify that time-series-paired texts may naturally exhibit periodic properties that closely mirror those of the original time series. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework, Texts as Time Series (TaTS), which considers the time-series-paired texts to be auxiliary variables of the time series. TaTS can be plugged into any existing numerical-only time series models and enable them to handle time series data with paired texts effectively. Through extensive experiments on both multimodal time series forecasting and imputation tasks across benchmark datasets with various existing time series models, we demonstrate that TaTS can enhance predictive performance without modifying model architectures.

Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention, where we steer the output of diffusion models based on some quantity on the goodness of the content. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual quality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should optimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper, we propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can select a better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward, at inference time. We then point out that the improvement of perceptual video quality considering the alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by weighting existing metrics. This is because when humans or vision language models evaluate outputs, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of video do not always correlate with evaluation. We demonstrate that our method improves the perceptual quality evaluated on the calibrated reward, VLMs, and human assessment, without model parameter update, and outputs the best generation compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling under much more efficient computational cost. The experiments highlight that our method is beneficial to many capable generative models, and provide a practical guideline that we should prioritize the inference-time compute allocation into lookahead steps for reward estimation over search budget or denoising steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/shim0114/T2V-Diffusion-Search</p></details> |

The edge clustering approach instead detects communities by clustering the edges of the graph and then assigning a vertex to a community if it has at least one edge in that community, thereby allowing for overlapping clusters of vertices. We apply the idea behind edge clustering to temporal hypergraphs, an extension of a graph where a single edge can contain any number of vertices and each edge has a timestamp. Extending to hypergraphs allows for many different patterns of interaction between edges, and by defining a suitable structural similarity function, our edge clustering algorithm can find clusters of these patterns. We test the algorithm with three structural similarity functions on a large collaboration hypergraph, and find intuitive cluster structures that could prove useful for downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, existing methods typically rely on transformer-based architectures, which often face challenges related to scalability and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel, efficient human-human interaction generation method based on the Mamba framework, designed to meet the demands of effectively capturing long-sequence dependencies while providing real-time feedback. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba framework that utilizes two parallel SSM branches with an adaptive mechanism to integrate the spatial and temporal features of motion sequences. To further enhance the model's ability to capture dependencies within individual motion sequences and the interactions between different individual sequences, we develop two key modules: the self-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module and the cross-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module, enabling efficient feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two interaction datasets with remarkable quality and efficiency. Compared to the baseline method InterGen, our approach not only improves accuracy but also requires a minimal parameter size of just 66M ,only 36% of InterGen's, while achieving an average inference speed of 0.57 seconds, which is 46% of InterGen's execution time.</p></details> |  |

Many end-to-end approaches rely on human annotations to learn intermediate perception and prediction tasks, while purely self-supervised approaches--which directly learn from sensor inputs to generate planning trajectories without human annotations often underperform the state of the art. We observe a key gap in the input representation space: end-to-end approaches built on MLLMs are often pretrained with reasoning tasks in 2D image space rather than the native 3D space in which autonomous vehicles plan. To this end, we propose S4-Driver, a scalable self-supervised motion planning algorithm with spatio-temporal visual representation, based on the popular PaLI multimodal large language model. S4-Driver uses a novel sparse volume strategy to seamlessly transform the strong visual representation of MLLMs from perspective view to 3D space without the need to finetune the vision encoder. This representation aggregates multi-view and multi-frame visual inputs and enables better prediction of planning trajectories in 3D space. To validate our method, we run experiments on both nuScenes and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (with in-house camera data). Results show that S4-Driver performs favorably against existing supervised multi-task approaches while requiring no human annotations. It also demonstrates great scalability when pretrained on large volumes of unannotated driving logs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025; Project website: s4-driver.github.io</p></details> |

As a fundamental problem in graph analysis, {\it community search (CS)} in temporal graphs has received growing attention but exhibits two major limitations: (1) Traditional methods typically require predefined subgraph structures, which are not always known in advance. (2) Learning-based methods struggle to capture temporal interaction information. To fill this research gap, in this paper, we propose an effective \textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{T}emporal \textbf{C}ommunity \textbf{S}earch with pre-training of temporal dynamics and subgraph knowledge model (\textbf{\model}). \model~contains two key stages: offline pre-training and online search. In the first stage, we introduce multiple learning objectives to facilitate the pre-training process in the unsupervised learning setting. In the second stage, we identify a candidate subgraph and compute community scores using the pre-trained node representations and a novel scoring mechanism to determine the final community members. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR'25 short paper track</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541v4)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Unit Commitment with Cost-Oriented Temporal Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02707v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-adaptive unit commitment (UC) has recently been investigated to reduce the scheduling costs by flexibly varying the temporal resolution, which is usually determined by clustering the net load patterns. However, there exists a misalignment between cost and net load patterns due to the discrete start-up costs and out-of-merit-order dispatch triggered by ramping and other constraints. The optimal time-adaptive resolution cannot be completely captured by clustering-based method. This paper proposes a cost-oriented method to address this misalignment by a novel bilevel optimization approach that is efficiently solved through a heuristic greedy algorithm. The impact of varying temporal resolution on the final scheduling costs are tested, based on which the temporal resolution is heuristically updated, achieving significant cost reduction without increasing the number of temporal periods. Subsequently, an improved discretized Adam optimization method together with offline warm start and online refinement strategy is proposed to efficiently search for the better temporal resolution configuration. Results show that the proposed cost-oriented UC temporal resolution determination method achieves enhanced cost efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, rapid changes in land surface dynamics necessitate frequent updates, quickly rendering previously collected samples obsolete and imposing significant labor demands for continuous manual updates. In this study, we aim to address this problem by dynamic sample generation using existing single-date static labeled samples. We introduce TasGen, a two-stage automated framework to automatically generate dynamic samples, designed to simultaneously model spectral and temporal dependencies in time-series remote sensing imagery via temporal-spectral embedding, capturing land surface changes without additional manual annotations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-R1: Towards Comprehensive Temporal Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13508v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities but lack robust temporal intelligence, struggling to integrate reasoning about the past with predictions and plausible generations of the future. Meanwhile, existing methods typically target isolated temporal skills, such as question answering about past events or basic forecasting, and exhibit poor generalization, particularly when dealing with events beyond their knowledge cutoff or requiring creative foresight. To address these limitations, we introduce \textit{Time-R1}, the first framework to endow a moderate-sized (3B-parameter) LLM with comprehensive temporal abilities: understanding, prediction, and creative generation. Our approach features a novel three-stage development path; the first two constitute a \textit{reinforcement learning (RL) curriculum} driven by a meticulously designed dynamic rule-based reward system. This framework progressively builds (1) foundational temporal understanding and logical event-time mappings from historical data, (2) future event prediction skills for events beyond its knowledge cutoff, and finally (3) enables remarkable generalization to creative future scenario generation without any fine-tuning. Strikingly, experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 outperforms models over 200 times larger, including the state-of-the-art 671B DeepSeek-R1, on highly challenging future event prediction and creative scenario generation benchmarks. This work provides strong evidence that thoughtfully engineered, progressive RL fine-tuning allows smaller, efficient models to achieve superior temporal performance, offering a practical and scalable path towards truly time-aware AI. To foster further research, we also release \textit{Time-Bench}, a large-scale multi-task temporal reasoning dataset derived from 10 years of news data, and our series of \textit{Time-R1} checkpoints.</p></details> |  |

This mismatch mirrors biological morphogenesis where developmental phases demand distinct genetic programs. Inspired by epigenetic regulation governing morphological specialization, we propose **(ANT)**, an **A**daptive **N**eural **T**emporal-Aware architecture. ANT orchestrates semantic granularity through: **(i) Semantic Temporally Adaptive (STA) Module:** Automatically partitions denoising into low-frequency structural planning and high-frequency refinement via spectral analysis. **(ii) Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling (DCFG):** Adaptively adjusts conditional to unconditional ratio enhancing efficiency while maintaining fidelity. **(iii) Temporal-semantic reweighting:** Quantitatively aligns text influence with phase requirements. Extensive experiments show that ANT can be applied to various baselines, significantly improving model performance, and achieving state-of-the-art semantic alignment on StableMoFusion.</p></details> |  |

They provide policymakers with the granular information needed to identify, target, and implement effective interventions and allocate resources appropriately. Traditional disease mapping methods typically rely on Poisson regression, modeling observed counts while adjusting for local covariates that are treated as fixed and known. However, these methods may fail to capture the complexities and uncertainties in areas with sparse or absent data. To address this challenge, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal top-down approach designed to estimate county-level OUD rates when direct small-area (county) data is unavailable. This method allows us to infer small-area OUD rates and quantify associated uncertainties, even in data-sparse environments using observed state-level OUD rates and a combination of state and county level informative covariates. We applied our approach to estimate OUD rates for 3,143 counties in the United States between 2010 and 2025. Model performance was assessed through simulation studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding and Improving Laplacian Positional Encodings For Temporal GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01596v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graph learning has applications in recommendation systems, traffic forecasting, and social network analysis. Although multiple architectures have been introduced, progress in positional encoding for temporal graphs remains limited. Extending static Laplacian eigenvector approaches to temporal graphs through the supra-Laplacian has shown promise, but also poses key challenges: high eigendecomposition costs, limited theoretical understanding, and ambiguity about when and how to apply these encodings. In this paper, we address these issues by (1) offering a theoretical framework that connects supra-Laplacian encodings to per-time-slice encodings, highlighting the benefits of leveraging additional temporal connectivity, (2) introducing novel methods to reduce the computational overhead, achieving up to 56x faster runtimes while scaling to graphs with 50,000 active nodes, and (3) conducting an extensive experimental study to identify which models, tasks, and datasets benefit most from these encodings. Our findings reveal that while positional encodings can significantly boost performance in certain scenarios, their effectiveness varies across different models.</p></details> | ECML-PKDD 2025 |
| **[Learning Perceptually Relevant Temporal Envelope Morphing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01588v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal envelope morphing, the process of interpolating between the amplitude dynamics of two audio signals, is an emerging problem in generative audio systems that lacks sufficient perceptual grounding. Morphing of temporal envelopes in a perceptually intuitive manner should enable new methods for sound blending in creative media and for probing perceptual organization in psychoacoustics. However, existing audio morphing techniques often fail to produce intermediate temporal envelopes when input sounds have distinct temporal structures; many morphers effectively overlay both temporal structures, leading to perceptually unnatural results. In this paper, we introduce a novel workflow for learning envelope morphing with perceptual guidance: we first derive perceptually grounded morphing principles through human listening studies, then synthesize large-scale datasets encoding these principles, and finally train machine learning models to create perceptually intermediate morphs. Specifically, we present: (1) perceptual principles that guide envelope morphing, derived from our listening studies, (2) a supervised framework to learn these principles, (3) an autoencoder that learns to compress temporal envelope structures into latent representations, and (4) benchmarks for evaluating audio envelope morphs, using both synthetic and naturalistic data, and show that our approach outperforms existing methods in producing temporally intermediate morphs. All code, models, and datasets will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |

However, existing studies on cultural understanding with vision-language models (VLMs) primarily emphasize geographic diversity, often overlooking the critical temporal dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hanfu-Bench, a novel, expert-curated multimodal dataset. Hanfu, a traditional garment spanning ancient Chinese dynasties, serves as a representative cultural heritage that reflects the profound temporal aspects of Chinese culture while remaining highly popular in Chinese contemporary society. Hanfu-Bench comprises two core tasks: cultural visual understanding and cultural image transcreation.The former task examines temporal-cultural feature recognition based on single- or multi-image inputs through multiple-choice visual question answering, while the latter focuses on transforming traditional attire into modern designs through cultural element inheritance and modern context adaptation. Our evaluation shows that closed VLMs perform comparably to non-experts on visual cutural understanding but fall short by 10\% to human experts, while open VLMs lags further behind non-experts. For the transcreation task, multi-faceted human evaluation indicates that the best-performing model achieves a success rate of only 42\%. Our benchmark provides an essential testbed, revealing significant challenges in this new direction of temporal cultural understanding and creative adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>cultu...</summary><p>cultural analysis, cultural visual understanding, cultural image transcreation</p></details> |

However, SNN model parameters are sensitive to temporal resolution, leading to significant performance drops when the temporal resolution of target data at the edge is not the same with that of the pre-deployment source data used for training, especially when fine-tuning is not possible at the edge. To address this challenge, we propose three novel domain adaptation methods for adapting neuron parameters to account for the change in time resolution without re-training on target time-resolution. The proposed methods are based on a mapping between neuron dynamics in SNNs and State Space Models (SSMs); and are applicable to general neuron models. We evaluate the proposed methods under spatio-temporal data tasks, namely the audio keyword spotting datasets SHD and MSWC as well as the image classification NMINST dataset. Our methods provide an alternative to - and in majority of the cases significantly outperform - the existing reference method that simply scales the time constant. Moreover, our results show that high accuracy on high temporal resolution data can be obtained by time efficient training on lower temporal resolution data and model adaptation.</p></details> |  |

By integrating implicit neural representations with latent variable models, TV-INRs learn distributions over time-continuous generator functions conditioned on signal-specific covariates. Unlike existing approaches that require extensive training, fine-tuning or meta-learning, our method achieves accurate individualized predictions through a single forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that with a single TV-INRs instance, we can accurately solve diverse imputation and forecasting tasks, offering a computationally efficient and scalable solution for real-world applications. TV-INRs excel especially in low-data regimes, where it outperforms existing methods by an order of magnitude in mean squared error for imputation task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Causal-based Simulation for Realistic Time-series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02084v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal Discovery plays a pivotal role in revealing relationships among observed variables, particularly in the temporal setup. While the majority of CD methods rely on synthetic data for evaluation, and recently for training, these fall short in accurately mirroring real-world scenarios; an effect even more evident in temporal data. Generation techniques depending on simplified assumptions on causal structure, effects and time, limit the quality and diversity of the simulated data. In this work, we introduce Temporal Causal-based Simulation (TCS), a robust framework for generating realistic time-series data and their associated temporal causal graphs. The approach is structured in three phases: estimating the true lagged causal structure of the data, approximating the functional dependencies between variables and learning the noise distribution of the corresponding causal model, each part of which can be explicitly tailored based on data assumptions and characteristics. Through an extensive evaluation process, we highlight that single detection methods for generated data discrimination prove inadequate, accentuating it as a multifaceted challenge. For this, we detail a Min-max optimization phase that draws on AutoML techniques. Our contributions include a flexible, model-agnostic pipeline for generating realistic temporal causal data, a thorough evaluation setup which enhances the validity of the generated datasets and insights into the challenges posed by realistic data generation. Through experiments involving not only real but also semi-synthetic and purely synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that while sampling realistic causal data remains a complex task, our method enriches the domain of generating sensible causal-based temporal data.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Modeling temporal hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01408v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Networks representing social, biological, technological or other systems are often characterized by higher-order interaction involving any number of nodes. Temporal hypergraphs are given by ordered sequences of hyperedges representing sets of nodes interacting at given points in time. In this paper we discuss how a recently proposed model family for time-stamped hyperedges - relational hyperevent models (RHEM) - can be employed to define tailored null distributions for temporal hypergraphs. RHEM can be specified with a given vector of temporal hyperedge statistics - functions that quantify the structural position of hyperedges in the history of previous hyperedges - and equate expected values of these statistics with their empirically observed values. This allows, for instance, to analyze the overrepresentation or underrepresentation of temporal hyperedge configurations in a model that reproduces the observed distributions of possibly complex sub-configurations, including but going beyond node degrees. Concrete examples include, but are not limited to, preferential attachment, repetition of subsets of any given size, triadic closure, homophily, and degree assortativity for subsets of any order.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unraveling Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models via the Pipeline Lens: A Comprehensive Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01364v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal deep learning models aims to utilize useful patterns in such data to support tasks like prediction. However, previous deep learning models designed for specific tasks typically require separate training for each use case, leading to increased computational and storage costs. To address this issue, spatio-temporal foundation models have emerged, offering a unified framework capable of solving multiple spatio-temporal tasks. These foundation models achieve remarkable success by learning general knowledge with spatio-temporal data or transferring the general capabilities of pre-trained language models. While previous surveys have explored spatio-temporal data and methodologies separately, they have ignored a comprehensive examination of how foundation models are designed, selected, pre-trained, and adapted. As a result, the overall pipeline for spatio-temporal foundation models remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we innovatively provide an up-to-date review of previous spatio-temporal foundation models from the pipeline perspective. The pipeline begins with an introduction to different types of spatio-temporal data, followed by details of data preprocessing and embedding techniques. The pipeline then presents a novel data property taxonomy to divide existing methods according to data sources and dependencies, providing efficient and effective model design and selection for researchers. On this basis, we further illustrate the training objectives of primitive models, as well as the adaptation techniques of transferred models. Overall, our survey provides a clear and structured pipeline to understand the connection between core elements of spatio-temporal foundation models while guiding researchers to get started quickly. Additionally, we introduce emerging opportunities such as multi-objective training in the field of spatio-temporal foundation models.</p></details> | 21 pages, 10 figures |

Existing FCIL methods typically integrate old knowledge preservation into local client training. However, these methods cannot avoid spatial-temporal client drift caused by data heterogeneity and often incur significant computational and communication overhead, limiting practical deployment. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a novel approach, Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation (STSA), which provides a unified framework to aggregate feature statistics both spatially (across clients) and temporally (across stages). The aggregated feature statistics are unaffected by data heterogeneity and can be used to update the classifier in closed form at each stage. Additionally, we introduce STSA-E, a communication-efficient variant with theoretical guarantees, achieving similar performance to STSA-E with much lower communication overhead. Extensive experiments on three widely used FCIL datasets, with varying degrees of data heterogeneity, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FCIL methods in terms of performance, flexibility, and both communication and computation efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Temporal Heads: Where Language Models Recall Time-specific Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14258v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the ability of language models to elicit facts has been widely investigated, how they handle temporally changing facts remains underexplored. We discover Temporal Heads, specific attention heads that primarily handle temporal knowledge, through circuit analysis. We confirm that these heads are present across multiple models, though their specific locations may vary, and their responses differ depending on the type of knowledge and its corresponding years. Disabling these heads degrades the model's ability to recall time-specific knowledge while maintaining its general capabilities without compromising time-invariant and question-answering performances. Moreover, the heads are activated not only numeric conditions ("In 2004") but also textual aliases ("In the year ..."), indicating that they encode a temporal dimension beyond simple numerical representation. Furthermore, we expand the potential of our findings by demonstrating how temporal knowledge can be edited by adjusting the values of these heads.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the main conference at ACL 2025</p></details> |

Traditional safety assurance approaches, such as state avoidance and constrained Markov decision processes, often inadequately capture trajectory requirements or may result in overly conservative behaviors. To address these limitations, recent studies advocate the use of formal specification languages such as linear temporal logic (LTL), enabling the derivation of correct-by-construction learning objectives from the specified requirements. However, the sparse rewards associated with LTL specifications make learning extremely difficult, whereas dense heuristic-based rewards risk compromising correctness. In this work, we propose the first method, to our knowledge, that integrates LTL with differentiable simulators, facilitating efficient gradient-based learning directly from LTL specifications by coupling with differentiable paradigms. Our approach introduces soft labeling to achieve differentiable rewards and states, effectively mitigating the sparse-reward issue intrinsic to LTL without compromising objective correctness. We validate the efficacy of our method through experiments, demonstrating significant improvements in both reward attainment and training time compared to the discrete methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOOSE: Pay Attention to Temporal Dynamics for Video Understanding via Optical Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01119v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many motion-centric video analysis tasks, such as atomic actions, detecting atypical motor behavior in individuals with autism, or analyzing articulatory motion in real-time MRI of human speech, require efficient and interpretable temporal modeling. Capturing temporal dynamics is a central challenge in video analysis, often requiring significant computational resources and fine-grained annotations that are not widely available. This paper presents MOOSE (Motion Flow Over Spatial Space), a novel temporally-centric video encoder explicitly integrating optical flow with spatial embeddings to model temporal information efficiently, inspired by human perception of motion. Unlike prior models, MOOSE takes advantage of rich, widely available pre-trained visual and optical flow encoders instead of training video models from scratch. This significantly reduces computational complexity while enhancing temporal interpretability. Our primary contributions includes (1) proposing a computationally efficient temporally-centric architecture for video understanding (2) demonstrating enhanced interpretability in modeling temporal dynamics; and (3) achieving state-of-the-art performance on diverse benchmarks, including clinical, medical, and standard action recognition datasets, confirming the broad applicability and effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Decoupled Learning for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01117v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention for their potential to enable energy-efficient artificial intelligence. However, effective and efficient training of SNNs remains an unresolved challenge. While backpropagation through time (BPTT) achieves high accuracy, it incurs substantial memory overhead. In contrast, biologically plausible local learning methods are more memory-efficient but struggle to match the accuracy of BPTT. To bridge this gap, we propose spatio-temporal decouple learning (STDL), a novel training framework that decouples the spatial and temporal dependencies to achieve both high accuracy and training efficiency for SNNs. Specifically, to achieve spatial decoupling, STDL partitions the network into smaller subnetworks, each of which is trained independently using an auxiliary network. To address the decreased synergy among subnetworks resulting from spatial decoupling, STDL constructs each subnetwork's auxiliary network by selecting the largest subset of layers from its subsequent network layers under a memory constraint. Furthermore, STDL decouples dependencies across time steps to enable efficient online learning. Extensive evaluations on seven static and event-based vision datasets demonstrate that STDL consistently outperforms local learning methods and achieves comparable accuracy to the BPTT method with considerably reduced GPU memory cost. Notably, STDL achieves 4x reduced GPU memory than BPTT on the ImageNet dataset. Therefore, this work opens up a promising avenue for memory-efficient SNN training.

This challenge stems from two key issues: first, incorporating spatial-temporal localization introduces a vast number of coordinate combinations, complicating the alignment of linguistic and visual coordinate representations; second, encoding fine-grained temporal and spatial information during video feature compression is inherently difficult. To address these issues, we propose LLaVA-ST, a MLLM for fine-grained spatial-temporal multimodal understanding. In LLaVA-ST, we propose Language-Aligned Positional Embedding, which embeds the textual coordinate special token into the visual space, simplifying the alignment of fine-grained spatial-temporal correspondences. Additionally, we design the Spatial-Temporal Packer, which decouples the feature compression of temporal and spatial resolutions into two distinct point-to-region attention processing streams. Furthermore, we propose ST-Align dataset with 4.3M training samples for fine-grained spatial-temporal multimodal understanding. With ST-align, we present a progressive training pipeline that aligns the visual and textual feature through sequential coarse-to-fine stages.Additionally, we introduce an ST-Align benchmark to evaluate spatial-temporal interleaved fine-grained understanding tasks, which include Spatial-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) , Event Localization and Captioning (ELC) and Spatial Video Grounding (SVG). LLaVA-ST achieves outstanding performance on 11 benchmarks requiring fine-grained temporal, spatial, or spatial-temporal interleaving multimodal understanding.

In this paper, we propose a noise-robust real-world VSR framework by incorporating self-supervised learning and Mamba into pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure content consistency across adjacent frames, we enhance the diffusion model with a global spatio-temporal attention mechanism using the Video State-Space block with a 3D Selective Scan module, which reinforces coherence at an affordable computational cost. To further reduce artifacts in generated details, we introduce a self-supervised ControlNet that leverages HR features as guidance and employs contrastive learning to extract degradation-insensitive features from LR videos. Finally, a three-stage training strategy based on a mixture of HR-LR videos is proposed to stabilize VSR training. The proposed Self-supervised ControlNet with Spatio-Temporal Continuous Mamba based VSR algorithm achieves superior perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Existing fine-tuning methods for conditional generation often rely on external encoders or architectural modifications, which demand large datasets and are typically restricted to spatially aligned conditioning, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce Temporal In-Context Fine-Tuning (TIC-FT), an efficient and versatile approach for adapting pretrained video diffusion models to diverse conditional generation tasks. Our key idea is to concatenate condition and target frames along the temporal axis and insert intermediate buffer frames with progressively increasing noise levels. These buffer frames enable smooth transitions, aligning the fine-tuning process with the pretrained model's temporal dynamics. TIC-FT requires no architectural changes and achieves strong performance with as few as 10-30 training samples. We validate our method across a range of tasks, including image-to-video and video-to-video generation, using large-scale base models such as CogVideoX-5B and Wan-14B. Extensive experiments show that TIC-FT outperforms existing baselines in both condition fidelity and visual quality, while remaining highly efficient in both training and inference.

The proposed algorithm, Distributed Hebbian Temporal Memory (DHTM), is based on the factor graph formalism and a multi-component neuron model. DHTM aims to capture sequential data relationships and make cumulative predictions about future observations, forming Successor Features (SFs). Inspired by neurophysiological models of the neocortex, the algorithm uses distributed representations, sparse transition matrices, and local Hebbian-like learning rules to overcome the instability and slow learning of traditional temporal memory algorithms such as RNN and HMM. Experimental results show that DHTM outperforms LSTM, RWKV and a biologically inspired HMM-like algorithm, CSCG, on non-stationary data sets. Our results suggest that DHTM is a promising approach to address the challenges of online sequence learning and planning in dynamic environments.</p></details> | Poster on ICLR 2025 |

In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Perfect Times} dataset, a novel, quadrilingual (English, Italian, Russian, and Japanese) multiple-choice question-answering benchmark designed to assess video-language models (VLMs) on temporal reasoning. By pairing everyday activity videos with event completion labels and perfectivity-tailored distractors, our dataset probes whether models truly comprehend temporal dynamics or merely latch onto superficial markers. Experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art models, despite their success on text-based tasks, struggle to mirror human-like temporal and causal reasoning grounded in video. This study underscores the necessity of integrating deep multimodal cues to capture the nuances of action duration and completion within temporal and causal video dynamics, setting a new standard for evaluating and advancing temporal reasoning in VLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, the interpretable spatio-temporal features extraction by soft sensors remains a challenge. In this light, this work introduces a novel method termed spatio-temporal consistent and interpretable model (STCIM). First, temporal and spatial features are captured and aligned by a far topological spatio-temporal consistency extraction block. Then, the features are mapped into an interpretable latent space for further prediction by explicitly giving physical meanings to latent variables. The efficacy of the proposed STCIM is demonstrated through the modeling of two generated datasets and a real-life dataset of coal-fired power plants. The corresponding experiments show: 1) The generalization of STCIM outperforms other methods, especially in different operation situations. 2) The far topological spatio-temporal consistency is vital for feature alignment. 3) The hyper-parameters of physics-informed interpretable latent space loss decide the performance of STCIM.</p></details> |  |

Scientometrics, the quantitative and qualitative study of scientific literature, provides valuable insights into these processes. We introduce SciEvo, a longitudinal scientometric dataset with over two million academic publications, providing comprehensive contents information and citation graphs to support cross-disciplinary analyses. SciEvo is easy to use and available across platforms, including GitHub, Kaggle, and HuggingFace. Using SciEvo, we conduct a temporal study spanning over 30 years to explore key questions in scientometrics: the evolution of academic terminology, citation patterns, and interdisciplinary knowledge exchange. Our findings reveal critical insights, such as disparities in epistemic cultures, knowledge production modes, and citation practices. For example, rapidly developing, application-driven fields like LLMs exhibit significantly shorter citation age (2.48 years) compared to traditional theoretical disciplines like oral history (9.71 years).

However, accurately forecasting STTS is challenging due to complex dynamic correlations in both time and space dimensions. Existing graph neural networks struggle to balance effectiveness and efficiency in modeling dynamic spatio-temporal relations. To address this problem, we propose the Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Stiefel Graph Neural Network (DST-SGNN) to efficiently process STTS. For DST-SGNN, we first introduce the novel Stiefel Graph Spectral Convolution (SGSC) and Stiefel Graph Fourier Transform (SGFT). The SGFT matrix in SGSC is constrained to lie on the Stiefel manifold, and SGSC can be regarded as a filtered graph spectral convolution. We also propose the Linear Dynamic Graph Optimization on Stiefel Manifold (LDGOSM), which can efficiently learn the SGFT matrix from the dynamic graph and significantly reduce the computational complexity. Finally, we propose a multi-layer SGSC (MSGSC) that efficiently captures complex spatio-temporal correlations. Extensive experiments on seven spatio-temporal datasets show that DST-SGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relatively low computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

However, recent studies show that SL methods lack the trajectory stitching capability, typically associated with temporal difference (TD)-based approaches. A question naturally surfaces: How can we endow SL methods with stitching capability and bridge its performance gap with TD learning? To answer this question, we introduce $Q$-conditioned maximization supervised learning for offline goal-conditioned RL, which enhances SL with the stitching capability through $Q$-conditioned policy and $Q$-conditioned maximization. Concretely, we propose Goal-Conditioned Reinforced Supervised Learning (GCReinSL), which consists of (1) estimating the $Q$-function by CVAE from the offline dataset and (2) finding the maximum $Q$-value within the data support by integrating $Q$-function maximization with Expectile Regression. In inference time, our policy chooses optimal actions based on such a maximum $Q$-value. Experimental results from stitching evaluations on offline RL datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior SL approaches with stitching capabilities and goal data augmentation techniques.</p></details> |  |

While Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are popular for modeling spatial dependencies, they rely on predefined adjacency structures and dynamic attention scores, introducing inductive biases and computational overhead that can obscure interpretability. We propose InterGAT, a simplified alternative to GAT that replaces masked attention with a fully learnable, symmetric node interaction matrix, capturing latent spatial relationships without relying on fixed graph topologies. Our framework, InterGAT-GRU, which incorporates a GRU-based temporal decoder, outperforms the baseline GAT-GRU in forecasting accuracy, achieving at least a 21% improvement on the SZ-Taxi dataset and a 6% improvement on the Los-Loop dataset across all forecasting horizons (15 to 60 minutes). Additionally, we observed reduction in training time by 60-70% compared to GAT-GRU baseline. Crucially, the learned interaction matrix reveals interpretable structure: it recovers sparse, topology-aware attention patterns that align with community structure. Spectral and clustering analyses show that the model captures both localized and global dynamics, offering insights into the functional topology driving predictions. This highlights how structure learning can simultaneously support prediction, computational efficiency, and topological interpretabil-ity in dynamic graph-based domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, workshop</p></details> |

Unlike in Gaussian likelihoods, inference is considerably encumbered by the inability to analytically integrate out the random effects and reduce the dimension of the parameter space. Iterative estimation algorithms struggle to converge due to the presence of weakly identified parameters. We devise Bayesian inference using predictive stacking that assimilates inference from analytically tractable conditional posterior distributions. We achieve this by expanding upon the Diaconis-Ylvisaker family of conjugate priors and exploiting generalised conjugate multivariate (GCM) distribution theory for exponential families, which enables exact sampling from analytically available posterior distributions conditional upon some process parameters. Subsequently, we assimilate inference over a range of values of these parameters using Bayesian predictive stacking. We evaluate inferential performance on simulated data, compare with full Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and apply our method to analyse spatially-temporally referenced avian count data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey database.</p></details> | 37 pages, 8 figures |

The growing number of transactions makes it necessary to use automatic tools that help law enforcement agencies detect such criminal activity. In this work, we present Amatriciana, a novel approach based on Graph Neural Networks to detect money launderers inside a graph of transactions by considering temporal information. Amatriciana uses the whole graph of transactions without splitting it into several time-based subgraphs, exploiting all relational information in the dataset. Our experiments on a public dataset reveal that the model can learn from a limited amount of data. Furthermore, when more data is available, the model outperforms other State-of-the-art approaches; in particular, Amatriciana decreases the number of False Positives (FPs) while detecting many launderers. In summary, Amatriciana achieves an F1 score of 0.76. In addition, it lowers the FPs by 55% with respect to other State-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as signal anomalies, noise, and distributional shifts. Existing solutions primarily enhance robustness by modifying network architectures or training procedures. Nevertheless, these approaches are computationally intensive and resource-demanding, especially for large-scale applications. In this paper, we explore a novel test-time computing paradigm, namely learning with calibration, ST-TTC, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through learning with calibration, we aim to capture periodic structural biases arising from non-stationarity during the testing phase and perform real-time bias correction on predictions to improve accuracy. Specifically, we first introduce a spectral-domain calibrator with phase-amplitude modulation to mitigate periodic shift and then propose a flash updating mechanism with a streaming memory queue for efficient test-time computation. ST-TTC effectively bypasses complex training-stage techniques, offering an efficient and generalizable paradigm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, universality, flexibility and efficiency of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

These tags are generated during an offline sleep phase and serve as compact references to past experience, allowing the learner to incorporate information beyond its immediate input range. We evaluate this idea in a controlled synthetic environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural network based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when facing temporal patterns on multiple timescales. We evaluate this idea in a controlled synthetic environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural network based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when facing temporal patterns on multiple timescales. Our results, while preliminary, suggest that temporal chunking can significantly enhance learning efficiency under resource constrained settings. A small-scale human pilot study using a Serial Reaction Time Task further motivates the idea of structural abstraction. Although limited to synthetic tasks, this work serves as an early proof-of-concept, with initial evidence that learned context tags can transfer across related task, offering potential for future applications in transfer learning.</p></details> |  |

In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of Temporal Information Retrieval and Temporal Question Answering, two research areas aimed at handling and understanding time-sensitive information. As the amount of time-stamped content from sources like news articles, web archives, and knowledge bases increases, systems must address challenges such as detecting temporal intent, normalizing time expressions, ordering events, and reasoning over evolving or ambiguous facts. These challenges are critical across many dynamic and time-sensitive domains, from news and encyclopedias to science, history, and social media. We review both traditional approaches and modern neural methods, including those that use transformer models and Large Language Models (LLMs). We also review recent advances in temporal language modeling, multi-hop reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), alongside benchmark datasets and evaluation strategies that test temporal robustness, recency awareness, and generalization.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task to enhance the models' generalization abilities. However, these models perform forecasting via simultaneously learning two kinds of entangled knowledge in the TKG: (1) general patterns, i.e., invariant temporal structures shared across different scenarios; and (2) scenario information, i.e., factual knowledge engaged in specific scenario, such as entities and relations. As a result, the learning processes of these two kinds of knowledge may interfere with each other, which potentially impact the generalization abilities of the models. To enhance the generalization ability of LLMs on this task, in this paper, we propose a General-to-Specific learning framework (G2S) that disentangles the learning processes of the above two kinds of knowledge. In the general learning stage, we mask the scenario information in different TKGs and convert it into anonymous temporal structures. After training on these structures, the model is able to capture the general patterns across different TKGs. In the specific learning stage, we inject the scenario information into the structures via either in-context learning or fine-tuning modes. Experimental results show that G2S effectively improves the generalization abilities of LLMs.</p></details> | Findings of ACL 2025 |

However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these Transformer-based DGNNs vary significantly, highlighting the importance of properly defining the SAM on dynamic graphs and comprehensively encoding temporal and interactive dynamics without extra complex modules. In this work, we propose TIDFormer, a dynamic graph TransFormer that fully exploits Temporal and Interactive Dynamics in an efficient manner. We clarify and verify the interpretability of our proposed SAM, addressing the open problem of its uninterpretable definitions on dynamic graphs in previous works. To model the temporal and interactive dynamics, respectively, we utilize the calendar-based time partitioning information and extract informative interaction embeddings for both bipartite and non-bipartite graphs using merely the sampled first-order neighbors. In addition, we jointly model temporal and interactive features by capturing potential changes in historical interaction patterns through a simple decomposition. We conduct extensive experiments on several dynamic graph datasets to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of TIDFormer. The experimental results demonstrate that TIDFormer excels, outperforming state-of-the-art models across most datasets and experimental settings. Furthermore, TIDFormer exhibits significant efficiency advantages compared to previous Transformer-based methods.</p></details> | KDD2025 |

However, these models suffer from the shortcut problem deeply rooted in auto-regressive prediction, causing error accumulation. The challenge becomes particularly evident for out-of-distribution data, as the pretraining performance may approach random model initialization for downstream tasks with long-term dynamics. To deal with this problem, we propose physics-informed temporal alignment (PITA), a self-supervised learning framework inspired by inverse problem solving. Specifically, PITA aligns the physical dynamics discovered at different time steps on each given PDE trajectory by integrating physics-informed constraints into the self-supervision signal. The alignment is derived from observation data without relying on known physics priors, indicating strong generalization ability to the out-of-distribution data. Extensive experiments show that PITA significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of existing foundation models on diverse time-dependent PDE data.

For example, different types of blood tests can be measured at different times and frequencies, resulting in fragmented and unevenly scattered temporal data. Similar issues of irregular sampling of different attributes occur in other domains, such as monitoring of large systems using event log files or the spread of fake news on social networks. Effectively learning from such data requires models that can handle sets of temporally sparse and heterogeneous signals. In this paper, we propose Graph Mixing Additive Networks (GMAN), a novel and interpretable-by-design model for learning over irregular sets of temporal signals. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world medical tasks, including a 4-point increase in the AUROC score of in-hospital mortality prediction, compared to existing methods. We further showcase GMAN's flexibility by applying it to a fake news detection task. We demonstrate how its interpretability capabilities, including node-level, graph-level, and subset-level importance, allow for transition phases detection and gaining medical insights with real-world high-stakes implications. Finally, we provide theoretical insights on GMAN expressive power.</p></details> |  |

It provides a systematic approach to quantifying resource consumption, emissions, and waste, enabling industries, researchers, and policymakers to identify hotspots for sustainability improvements. By providing a comprehensive assessment of systems, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal, LCA facilitates the development of environmentally sound strategies, thereby contributing significantly to sustainable engineering and informed decision-making. Despite its strengths and ubiquitous use, life cycle analysis has not been reconciled with the broader literature in model-based systems engineering and analysis, thus hindering its integration into the design of complex systems more generally. This lack of reconciliation poses a significant problem, as it hinders the seamless integration of environmental sustainability into the design and optimization of complex systems. Without alignment between life cycle analysis (LCA) and model-based systems engineering (MBSE), sustainability remains an isolated consideration rather than an inherent part of the system's architecture and design. The original contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper reconciles process-based life cycle analysis with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory. It ultimately proves that model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory are a formal generalization of process-based life cycle analysis. Secondly, the paper demonstrates how model-based systems engineering and hetero-functional graph theory may be used to enhance the spatio-temporal resolution of process-based life cycle analysis in a manner that aligns with system design objectives.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Yet, achieving scalable, low-power end-to-end on-chip learning, especially from real-world sequential data with a limited number of examples, is an open challenge. Indeed, accelerators supporting error backpropagation optimize for learning performance at the expense of inference efficiency, while simplified learning algorithms often fail to reach acceptable accuracy targets. In this work, we present Chameleon, leveraging three key contributions to solve these challenges. (i) A unified learning and inference architecture supports few-shot learning (FSL), continual learning (CL) and inference at only 0.5% area overhead to the inference logic. (ii) Long temporal dependencies are efficiently captured with temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), enabling the first demonstration of end-to-end on-chip FSL and CL on sequential data and inference on 16-kHz raw audio. (iii) A dual-mode, matrix-multiplication-free compute array allows either matching the power consumption of state-of-the-art inference-only keyword spotting (KWS) accelerators or enabling $4.3\times$ higher peak GOPS. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS, Chameleon sets new accuracy records on Omniglot for end-to-end on-chip FSL (96.8%, 5-way 1-shot, 98.8%, 5-way 5-shot) and CL (82.2% final accuracy for learning 250 classes with 10 shots), while maintaining an inference accuracy of 93.3% on the 12-class Google Speech Commands dataset at an extreme-edge power budget of 3.1 $\mu$W.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

However, they struggle with temporal reasoning, which requires processing time-related information such as event sequencing, durations, and inter-temporal relationships. These capabilities are critical for applications including question answering, scheduling, and historical analysis. In this paper, we introduce TISER, a novel framework that enhances the temporal reasoning abilities of LLMs through a multi-stage process that combines timeline construction with iterative self-reflection. Our approach leverages test-time scaling to extend the length of reasoning traces, enabling models to capture complex temporal dependencies more effectively. This strategy not only boosts reasoning accuracy but also improves the traceability of the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including out-of-distribution test sets, and reveal that TISER enables smaller open-source models to surpass larger closed-weight models on challenging temporal reasoning tasks.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Main) |

Due to the sensitive information contained in the graph, directly sharing the streaming graphs poses significant privacy risks. Differential privacy, offering strict theoretical guarantees, has emerged as a standard approach for private graph data synthesis. However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graph publishing, neglecting the intrinsic relationship between adjacent graphs, thereby resulting in limited performance in streaming data publishing scenarios. To address this gap, we propose PSGraph, the first differentially private streaming graph synthesis framework that integrates temporal dynamics. PSGraph adaptively adjusts the privacy budget allocation mechanism by analyzing the variations in the current graph compared to the previous one for conserving the privacy budget. Moreover, PSGraph aggregates information across various timestamps and adopts crucial post-processing techniques to enhance the synthetic streaming graphs. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets under five commonly used metrics. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed PSGraph.</p></details> |  |

Such data show dependence across several dimensions of space as well as in time, and can easily involve hundreds of thousands of observations. Many spatio-temporal models result in a dependence structure across all observations and can be fit only at a substantial computational cost, arising from dense matrix inversion, high dimensional parameter spaces, poor mixing in Markov Chain Monte Carlo, or the impossibility of utilizing parallel computing due to a lack of independence anywhere in the model fitting process. These computational challenges are exacerbated when the response variable is ordinal, and especially as the number of ordered categories grows. Some spatio-temporal models achieve computational feasibility for large datasets but only through overly restrictive model simplifications, which we seek to avoid here. In this paper we demonstrate a two-stage algorithm to fit a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to large datasets when the response variable is ordinal. The first stage models locations independently in space, capturing temporal dependence, and can be run in parallel. The second stage resamples from the first stage posterior distributions with an acceptance probability computed to impose spatial dependence from the full spatio-temporal model. The result is fast Bayesian inference which samples from the full spatio-temporal posterior and is computationally feasible even for large datasets. We quantify the substantial computational gains our approach achieves, and demonstrate the preservation of the posterior distribution as compared to the more costly single-stage model fit. We apply our approach to a large spatio-temporal drought dataset in the United States, a dataset too large for many existing spatio-temporal methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random walk based snapshot clustering for detecting community dynamics in temporal networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12187v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of many dynamical systems that describe relationships or interactions between objects can be effectively modeled by temporal networks, which are typically represented as a sequence of static network snapshots. In this paper, we introduce a novel random walk-based approach that can identify clusters of time-snapshots in which network community structures are stable. This allows us to detect significant structural shifts over time, such as the splitting or merging of communities or their births and deaths. We also provide a low-dimensional representation of entire snapshots, placing those with similar community structure close to each other in the feature space. To validate our approach, we develop an agent-based algorithm that generates synthetic datasets with the desired characteristic properties, enabling thorough testing and benchmarking. We further demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of our technique by testing it on various social dynamics models and real-world datasets and comparing its performance to several state-of-the-art algorithms. Our findings highlight the strength of our approach to correctly capture and analyze the dynamics of complex systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing the Accuracy of Spatio-Temporal Models for Wind Speed Prediction by Incorporating Bias-Corrected Crowdsourced Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24506v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate high-resolution spatial and temporal wind speed data is critical for estimating the wind energy potential of a location. For real-time wind speed prediction, statistical models typically depend on high-quality (near) real-time data from official meteorological stations to improve forecasting accuracy. Personal weather stations (PWS) offer an additional source of real-time data and broader spatial coverage than offical stations. However, they are not subject to rigorous quality control and may exhibit bias or measurement errors. This paper presents a framework for incorporating PWS data into statistical models for validated official meteorological station data via a two-stage approach. First, bias correction is performed on PWS wind speed data using reanalysis data. Second, we implement a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model that accounts for varying measurement error in the PWS data. This enables wind speed prediction across a target area, and is particularly beneficial for improving predictions in regions sparse in official monitoring stations. Our results show that including bias-corrected PWS data improves prediction accuracy compared to using meteorological station data alone, with a 7% reduction in prediction error on average across all sites. The results are comparable with popular reanalysis products, but unlike these numerical weather models our approach is available in real-time and offers improved uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |

However, enhancing LLMs' cognitive development in social domains, particularly from a post-training perspective, remains underexplored. Recognizing that the social world follows a distinct timeline and requires a richer blend of cognitive modes (from intuitive reactions (System 1) and surface-level thinking to deliberate thinking (System 2)) than mathematics, which primarily relies on System 2 cognition (careful, step-by-step reasoning), we introduce Temporal-aware Hierarchical Cognitive Reinforcement Learning (TimeHC-RL) for enhancing LLMs' social intelligence. In our experiments, we systematically explore improving LLMs' social intelligence and validate the effectiveness of the TimeHC-RL method, through five other post-training paradigms and two test-time intervention paradigms on eight datasets with diverse data patterns. Experimental results reveal the superiority of our proposed TimeHC-RL method compared to the widely adopted System 2 RL method. It gives the 7B backbone model wings, enabling it to rival the performance of advanced models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O3. Additionally, the systematic exploration from post-training and test-time interventions perspectives to improve LLMs' social intelligence has uncovered several valuable insights.</p></details> | 22 pages, 12 figures |

The resulting patterns are often neglected by temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs). To formally analyze the expressive power of TGNNs, we lack a generalization of graph isomorphism to temporal graphs that fully captures their causal topology. Addressing this gap, we introduce the notion of consistent event graph isomorphism, which utilizes a time-unfolded representation of time-respecting paths in temporal graphs. We compare this definition with existing notions of temporal graph isomorphisms. We illustrate and highlight the advantages of our approach and develop a temporal generalization of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm to heuristically distinguish non-isomorphic temporal graphs. Building on this theoretical foundation, we derive a novel message passing scheme for temporal graph neural networks that operates on the event graph representation of temporal graphs. An experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs well in a temporal graph classification experiment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Inference for Spatially-Temporally Misaligned Data Using Predictive Stacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24397v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Air pollution remains a major environmental risk factor that is often associated with adverse health outcomes. However, quantifying and evaluating its effects on human health is challenging due to the complex nature of exposure data. Recent technological advances have led to the collection of various indicators of air pollution at increasingly high spatial-temporal resolutions (e.g., daily averages of pollutant levels at spatial locations referenced by latitude-longitude). However, health outcomes are typically aggregated over several spatial-temporal coordinates (e.g., annual prevalence for a county) to comply with survey regulations. This article develops a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze such spatially-temporally misaligned exposure and health outcome data. We introduce Bayesian predictive stacking, which optimally combines multiple predictive spatial-temporal models and avoids iterative estimation algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo that struggle due to convergence issues inflicted by the presence of weakly identified parameters. We apply our proposed method to study the effects of ozone on asthma in the state of California.</p></details> | 34 pages, 14 figures |

Further, relational data like graphs disobeying the Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) condition makes the problem more challenging, especially much harder when it is associated with time. Motivated by this, to realize the robust invariant learning over temporal graphs, we want to investigate what components in temporal graphs are most invariant and representative with respect to labels. With the Information Bottleneck (IB) method, we propose an error-bounded Invariant Link Selector that can distinguish invariant components and variant components during the training process to make the deep learning model generalizable for different testing scenarios. Besides deriving a series of rigorous generalizable optimization functions, we also equip the training with task-specific loss functions, e.g., temporal link prediction, to make pretrained models solve real-world application tasks like citation recommendation and merchandise recommendation, as demonstrated in our experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

However, because it does not include the previous administration ending in 2008, the collection is unsuitable for answering our research question, Were the website terms deleted by the Trump administration (2017--2021) added by the Obama administration (2009--2017)? Thus, like many researchers using the Wayback Machine's holdings for historical analysis, we do not have access to a complete collection suiting our needs. To answer our research question, we must extend the EDGI collection back to January, 2008. This includes discovering relevant pages that were not included in the EDGI collection that persisted through 2020, not just going further back in time with the existing pages. We pieced together artifacts collected by various organizations for their purposes through many means (Save Page Now, Archive-It, and more) in order to curate a dataset sufficient for our intentions. In this paper, we contribute a methodology to extend existing web archive collections temporally to enable longitudinal analysis, including a dataset extended with this methodology. We use our new dataset to analyze our question, Were the website terms deleted by the Trump administration added by the Obama administration? We find that 81 percent of the pages in the dataset changed between 2008 and 2020, and that 87 percent of the pages with terms deleted by the Trump administration were terms added during the Obama administration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at RESAW 2025; 23 pages, 14 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a neuro-symbolic explanation framework that generates a weighted signal temporal logic (wSTL) specification to describe a robot policy in a interpretable form. Existing methods typically produce explanations that are verbose and inconsistent, which hinders explainability, and loose, which do not give meaningful insights into the underlying policy. We address these issues by introducing a simplification process consisting of predicate filtering, regularization, and iterative pruning. We also introduce three novel explainability evaluation metrics -- conciseness, consistency, and strictness -- to assess explanation quality beyond conventional classification metrics. Our method is validated in three simulated robotic environments, where it outperforms baselines in generating concise, consistent, and strict wSTL explanations without sacrificing classification accuracy. This work bridges policy learning with formal methods, contributing to safer and more transparent decision-making in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

We propose a human-preference-aligned diffusion framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce direct preference optimization tailored for human-centric animation, leveraging a curated dataset of human preferences to align generated outputs with perceptual metrics for portrait motion-video alignment and naturalness of expression. Second, the proposed temporal motion modulation resolves spatiotemporal resolution mismatches by reshaping motion conditions into dimensionally aligned latent features through temporal channel redistribution and proportional feature expansion, preserving the fidelity of high-frequency motion details in diffusion-based synthesis. The proposed mechanism is complementary to existing UNet and DiT-based portrait diffusion approaches, and experiments demonstrate obvious improvements in lip-audio synchronization, expression vividness, body motion coherence over baseline methods, alongside notable gains in human preference metrics.

Existing supervised or weakly supervised methods heavily rely on labeled temporal boundaries and action categories, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Consequently, unsupervised temporal action localization (UTAL) has gained popularity. However, current methods face two main challenges: 1) Classification pre-trained features overly focus on highly discriminative regions; 2) Solely relying on visual modality information makes it difficult to determine contextual boundaries. To address these issues, we propose a CLIP-assisted cross-view audiovisual enhanced UTAL method. Specifically, we introduce visual language pre-training (VLP) and classification pre-training-based collaborative enhancement to avoid excessive focus on highly discriminative regions; we also incorporate audio perception to provide richer contextual boundary information. Finally, we introduce a self-supervised cross-view learning paradigm to achieve multi-view perceptual enhancement without additional annotations. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate our model's superiority over several state-of-the-art competitors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangled Multi-span Evolutionary Network against Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14020v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), as an extension of static Knowledge Graphs (KGs), incorporate the temporal feature to express the transience of knowledge by describing when facts occur. TKG extrapolation aims to infer possible future facts based on known history, which has garnered significant attention in recent years. Some existing methods treat TKG as a sequence of independent subgraphs to model temporal evolution patterns, demonstrating impressive reasoning performance. However, they still have limitations: 1) In modeling subgraph semantic evolution, they usually neglect the internal structural interactions between subgraphs, which are actually crucial for encoding TKGs. 2) They overlook the potential smooth features that do not lead to semantic changes, which should be distinguished from the semantic evolution process. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Multi-span Evolutionary Network (DiMNet) for TKG reasoning. Specifically, we design a multi-span evolution strategy that captures local neighbor features while perceiving historical neighbor semantic information, thus enabling internal interactions between subgraphs during the evolution process. To maximize the capture of semantic change patterns, we design a disentangle component that adaptively separates nodes' active and stable features, used to dynamically control the influence of historical semantics on future evolution. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world TKG datasets show that DiMNet demonstrates substantial performance in TKG reasoning, and outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 22.7% in MRR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

We address the task of extracting clinical events and their temporal relations using the well-studied I2B2 2012 Temporal Relations Challenge corpus. This task is inherently challenging due to complex clinical language, long documents, and sparse annotations. We introduce GRAPHTREX, a novel method integrating span-based entity-relation extraction, clinical large pre-trained language models (LPLMs), and Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) to capture local and global dependencies. Our HGT component facilitates information propagation across the document through innovative global landmarks that bridge distant entities. Our method improves the state-of-the-art with 5.5% improvement in the tempeval $F_1$ score over the previous best and up to 8.9% improvement on long-range relations, which presents a formidable challenge.

Existing methods, primarily optimized for single images, often suffer from temporal inconsistencies and fail to capture fine-grained dynamic details. To address these limitations, we present GeoMan, a novel architecture designed to produce accurate and temporally consistent depth and normal estimations from monocular human videos. GeoMan addresses two key challenges: the scarcity of high-quality 4D training data and the need for metric depth estimation to accurately model human size. To overcome the first challenge, GeoMan employs an image-based model to estimate depth and normals for the first frame of a video, which then conditions a video diffusion model, reframing video geometry estimation task as an image-to-video generation problem. This design offloads the heavy lifting of geometric estimation to the image model and simplifies the video model's role to focus on intricate details while using priors learned from large-scale video datasets. Consequently, GeoMan improves temporal consistency and generalizability while requiring minimal 4D training data. To address the challenge of accurate human size estimation, we introduce a root-relative depth representation that retains critical human-scale details and is easier to be estimated from monocular inputs, overcoming the limitations of traditional affine-invariant and metric depth representations. GeoMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming longstanding challenges in 3D human geometry estimation from videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dair/geoman</p></details> |

Yet, the intricate interaction between the moving and static elements of the skeleton presents a rarely tapped discriminative potential for action classification. This paper introduces a novel measurement, referred to as spatial-temporal joint density (STJD), to quantify such interaction. Tracking the evolution of this density throughout an action can effectively identify a subset of discriminative moving and/or static joints termed "prime joints" to steer self-supervised learning. A new contrastive learning strategy named STJD-CL is proposed to align the representation of a skeleton sequence with that of its prime joints while simultaneously contrasting the representations of prime and nonprime joints. In addition, a method called STJD-MP is developed by integrating it with a reconstruction-based framework for more effective learning. Experimental evaluations on the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKUMMD datasets in various downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed STJD-CL and STJD-MP improved performance, particularly by 3.5 and 3.6 percentage points over the state-of-the-art contrastive methods on the NTU RGB+D 120 dataset using X-sub and X-set evaluations, respectively.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel framework for building temporal digital twins of plants by combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with a robust sample alignment pipeline. Our method begins by reconstructing Gaussian Splats from multi-view camera data, then leverages a two-stage registration approach: coarse alignment through feature-based matching and Fast Global Registration, followed by fine alignment with Iterative Closest Point. This pipeline yields a consistent 4D model of plant development in discrete time steps. We evaluate the approach on data from the Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Center, demonstrating detailed temporal reconstructions of Sequoia and Quinoa species.

Unlike existing approaches, the present method operates directly on the received FMCW signal. Additionally, we identify key challenges in applying deep learning to wideband FMCW interference mitigation and outline directions for future research to enhance real-time feasibility and generalization to arbitrary interference conditions.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

In contrast, current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively plan and act in dynamic, multi-room 3D environments. We posit that part of this limitation is due to the lack of proper 3D spatial-temporal memory modeling in LLMs. To address this, we first introduce 3DMem-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over 26,000 trajectories and 2,892 embodied tasks, question-answering and captioning, designed to evaluate an agent's ability to reason over long-term memory in 3D environments. Second, we propose 3DLLM-Mem, a novel dynamic memory management and fusion model for embodied spatial-temporal reasoning and actions in LLMs. Our model uses working memory tokens, which represents current observations, as queries to selectively attend to and fuse the most useful spatial and temporal features from episodic memory, which stores past observations and interactions. Our approach allows the agent to focus on task-relevant information while maintaining memory efficiency in complex, long-horizon environments. Experimental results demonstrate that 3DLLM-Mem achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, outperforming the strongest baselines by 16.5% in success rate on 3DMem-Bench's most challenging in-the-wild embodied tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>demos...</summary><p>demos at: https://3dllm-mem.github.io</p></details> |

Prior work adapted basic proportional representation concepts -- justified representation (JR), proportional JR (PJR), and extended JR (EJR) -- from the multiwinner setting to the temporal setting. Our work introduces and examines ways of going beyond EJR. Specifically, we consider stronger variants of JR, PJR, and EJR, and introduce temporal adaptations of more demanding multiwinner axioms, such as EJR+, full JR (FJR), full proportional JR (FPJR), and the Core. For each of these concepts, we investigate its existence and study its relationship to existing notions, thereby establishing a rich hierarchy of proportionality concepts. Notably, we show that two of our proposed axioms -- EJR+ and FJR -- strengthen EJR while remaining satisfiable in every temporal election.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 3DGS-based methods for dynamic reconstruction often suffer from \textit{spatio-temporal incoherence} during initialization, where canonical Gaussians are constructed by aggregating observations from multiple frames without temporal distinction. This results in spatio-temporally entangled representations, making it difficult to model dynamic motion accurately. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{STDR} (Spatio-Temporal Decoupling for Real-time rendering), a plug-and-play module that learns spatio-temporal probability distributions for each Gaussian. STDR introduces a spatio-temporal mask, a separated deformation field, and a consistency regularization to jointly disentangle spatial and temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating our module into existing 3DGS-based dynamic scene reconstruction frameworks leads to notable improvements in both reconstruction quality and spatio-temporal consistency across synthetic and real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</p></details> |  |
| **[EventFlow: Forecasting Temporal Point Processes with Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07430v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous-time event sequences, in which events occur at irregular intervals, are ubiquitous across a wide range of industrial and scientific domains. The contemporary modeling paradigm is to treat such data as realizations of a temporal point process, and in machine learning it is common to model temporal point processes in an autoregressive fashion using a neural network. While autoregressive models are successful in predicting the time of a single subsequent event, their performance can degrade when forecasting longer horizons due to cascading errors and myopic predictions. We propose EventFlow, a non-autoregressive generative model for temporal point processes. The model builds on the flow matching framework in order to directly learn joint distributions over event times, side-stepping the autoregressive process. EventFlow is simple to implement and achieves a 20%-53% lower error than the nearest baseline on standard TPP benchmarks while simultaneously using fewer model calls at sampling time.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, dataset distillation (DD) has emerged as a promising approach to generating highly compact synthetic datasets with significantly less redundancy while preserving essential information. However, while DD has been extensively studied for image datasets, DD on video datasets remains underexplored. Video datasets present unique challenges due to the presence of temporal information and varying levels of redundancy across different classes. Existing DD approaches assume a uniform level of temporal redundancy across all different video semantics, which limits their effectiveness on video datasets. In this work, we propose Dynamic-Aware Video Distillation (DAViD), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to predict the optimal Temporal Resolution of the synthetic videos. A teacher-in-the-loop reward function is proposed to update the RL agent policy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce adaptive temporal resolution based on video semantics in video dataset distillation. Our approach significantly outperforms existing DD methods, demonstrating substantial improvements in performance. This work paves the way for future research on more efficient and semantic-adaptive video dataset distillation research.</p></details> |  |

Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations.

| **[AgriFM: A Multi-source Temporal Remote Sensing Foundation Model for Crop Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21357v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate crop mapping fundamentally relies on modeling multi-scale spatiotemporal patterns, where spatial scales range from individual field textures to landscape-level context, and temporal scales capture both short-term phenological transitions and full growing-season dynamics. Transformer-based remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) offer promising potential for crop mapping due to their innate ability for unified spatiotemporal processing. However, current RSFMs remain suboptimal for crop mapping: they either employ fixed spatiotemporal windows that ignore the multi-scale nature of crop systems or completely disregard temporal information by focusing solely on spatial patterns. To bridge these gaps, we present AgriFM, a multi-source remote sensing foundation model specifically designed for agricultural crop mapping. Our approach begins by establishing the necessity of simultaneous hierarchical spatiotemporal feature extraction, leading to the development of a modified Video Swin Transformer architecture where temporal down-sampling is synchronized with spatial scaling operations. This modified backbone enables efficient unified processing of long time-series satellite inputs. AgriFM leverages temporally rich data streams from three satellite sources including MODIS, Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2, and is pre-trained on a global representative dataset comprising over 25 million image samples supervised by land cover products. The resulting framework incorporates a versatile decoder architecture that dynamically fuses these learned spatiotemporal representations, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate AgriFM's superior performance over conventional deep learning approaches and state-of-the-art general-purpose RSFMs across all downstream tasks. Codes will be available at https://github.com/flyakon/AgriFM.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown immense promise in efficiently processing these signals. However, progress in this field has been impeded by the lack of effective and standardized benchmarks, which complicates the consistent measurement of technological advancements and limits the practical applicability of SNNs. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Neuromorphic Sequential Arena (NSA), a comprehensive benchmark that offers an effective, versatile, and application-oriented evaluation framework for neuromorphic temporal processing. The NSA includes seven real-world temporal processing tasks from a diverse range of application scenarios, each capturing rich temporal dynamics across multiple timescales. Utilizing NSA, we conduct extensive comparisons of recently introduced spiking neuron models and neural architectures, presenting comprehensive baselines in terms of task performance, training speed, memory usage, and energy efficiency. Our findings emphasize an urgent need for efficient SNN designs that can consistently deliver high performance across tasks with varying temporal complexities while maintaining low computational costs. NSA enables systematic tracking of advancements in neuromorphic algorithm research and paves the way for developing effective and efficient neuromorphic temporal processing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2025)</p></details> |

To make profits, prosumers equipped with photovoltaic (PV) panels and even the energy storage system (ESS) can actively participate in the real-time P2P energy market and trade energy. However, in real situations, system states such as energy demands and renewable energy power generation are highly uncertain, making it difficult for prosumers to make optimal real-time decisions. Moreover, severe problems with the physical network can arise from the real-time P2P energy trading, such as bus voltage violations and line overload. To handle these problems, this work first formulates the real-time P2P energy trading problem as a spatio-temporally constrained stochastic optimization problem by considering ESS and the spatial physical network constraints. To deal with the uncertainties online, a modified Lyapunov optimization method is innovatively proposed to approximately reformulate the stochastic optimization problem into an online one by relaxing the time-coupling constraints. Compared with the state-of-the-art online methods, the proposed one renders more flexibility and better performance for the real-time P2P energy market operation. Additionally, to protect the prosumers' privacy, an online distributed algorithm based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to solve the reformulated online problem by decoupling the spatial constraints. The theoretical near-optimal performance guarantee of the proposed online distributed algorithm is derived, and its performance can be further improved by minimizing the performance gap. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed online distributed algorithm can guarantee the fast, stable, and safe long-term operation of the real-time P2P energy market.</p></details> |  |

We make three significant contributions that improve the current state-of-the-art results: (i) we derive sharper high probability convergence guarantee that depend explicitly on the asymptotic variance and hold under weaker conditions than those normally assumed; (ii) we establish refined high-dimensional Berry-Esseen bounds over the class of convex sets, achieving faster rates than those previously established in the literature, and (iii) we propose and analyze a novel, computationally efficient online plug-in estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix.These results enable the construction of confidence regions and simultaneous confidence intervals for the linear parameters of the value function approximation, with guaranteed finite-sample coverage. We demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral clustering for dependent community Hawkes process models of temporal networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21845v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal networks observed continuously over time through timestamped relational events data are commonly encountered in application settings including online social media communications, financial transactions, and international relations. Temporal networks often exhibit community structure and strong dependence patterns among node pairs. This dependence can be modeled through mutual excitations, where an interaction event from a sender to a receiver node increases the possibility of future events among other node pairs. We provide statistical results for a class of models that we call dependent community Hawkes (DCH) models, which combine the stochastic block model with mutually exciting Hawkes processes for modeling both community structure and dependence among node pairs, respectively. We derive a non-asymptotic upper bound on the misclustering error of spectral clustering on the event count matrix as a function of the number of nodes and communities, time duration, and the amount of dependence in the model. Our result leverages recent results on bounding an appropriate distance between a multivariate Hawkes process count vector and a Gaussian vector, along with results from random matrix theory. We also propose a DCH model that incorporates only self and reciprocal excitation along with highly scalable parameter estimation using a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator that we demonstrate to be consistent for growing network size and time duration.</p></details> |  |

However, their iterative denoising process results in significant computational overhead during inference, limiting their practical deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing acceleration methods often adopt uniform strategies that fail to capture the temporal variations during diffusion generation, while the commonly adopted sequential pruning-then-fine-tuning strategy suffers from sub-optimality due to the misalignment between pruning decisions made on pretrained weights and the model's final parameters. To address these limitations, we introduce ALTER: All-in-One Layer Pruning and Temporal Expert Routing, a unified framework that transforms diffusion models into a mixture of efficient temporal experts. ALTER achieves a single-stage optimization that unifies layer pruning, expert routing, and model fine-tuning by employing a trainable hypernetwork, which dynamically generates layer pruning decisions and manages timestep routing to specialized, pruned expert sub-networks throughout the ongoing fine-tuning of the UNet. This unified co-optimization strategy enables significant efficiency gains while preserving high generative quality. Specifically, ALTER achieves same-level visual fidelity to the original 50-step Stable Diffusion v2.1 model while utilizing only 25.9% of its total MACs with just 20 inference steps and delivering a 3.64x speedup through 35% sparsity.</p></details> |  |

Early risk models have limited performance and recently machine learning-based analysis of mammogram images showed encouraging risk prediction effects. These models however are limited to the use of a single exam or tend to overlook nuanced breast tissue evolvement in spatial and temporal details of longitudinal imaging exams that are indicative of breast cancer risk. In this paper, we propose STA-Risk (Spatial and Temporal Asymmetry-based Risk Prediction), a novel Transformer-based model that captures fine-grained mammographic imaging evolution simultaneously from bilateral and longitudinal asymmetries for breast cancer risk prediction. STA-Risk is innovative by the side encoding and temporal encoding to learn spatial-temporal asymmetries, regulated by a customized asymmetry loss. We performed extensive experiments with two independent mammogram datasets and achieved superior performance than four representative SOTA models for 1- to 5-year future risk prediction. Source codes will be released upon publishing of the paper.</p></details> |  |

Spatio-temporal deep learning models, while scalable, typically assume a simplistic independent covariance matrix for the response, failing to capture the underlying correlation structure. However, spatio-temporal GPs suffer from issues of scalability and various forms of approximation bias resulting from restrictive assumptions of the covariance kernel function. We propose STACI, a novel framework consisting of a variational Bayesian neural network approximation of non-stationary spatio-temporal GP along with a novel spatio-temporal conformal inference algorithm. STACI is highly scalable, taking advantage of GPU training capabilities for neural network models, and provides statistically valid prediction intervals for uncertainty quantification. STACI outperforms competing GPs and deep methods in accurately approximating spatio-temporal processes and we show it easily scales to datasets with millions of observations.</p></details> |  |

However, standard FL strategies often encounter significant operational challenges related to fault tolerance, system resilience against concurrent client and server failures, and the provision of robust, verifiable privacy guarantees essential for handling sensitive data. These deficiencies can lead to training disruptions, data loss, compromised model integrity, and non-compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). This paper introduces Differentially Private Resilient Temporal Federated Learning (DP-RTFL), an advanced FL framework designed to ensure training continuity, precise state recovery, and strong data privacy. DP-RTFL integrates local Differential Privacy (LDP) at the client level with resilient temporal state management and integrity verification mechanisms, such as hash-based commitments (referred to as Zero-Knowledge Integrity Proofs or ZKIPs in this context). The framework is particularly suited for critical applications like credit risk assessment using sensitive financial data, aiming to be operationally robust, auditable, and scalable for enterprise AI deployments. The implementation of the DP-RTFL framework is available as open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages (IEEE conference format), 10 figures.

However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution (STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural, and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances in general video understanding, current MLLMs still struggle with fine-grained temporal reasoning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to address this issue recently, existing RL approaches remain limited in effectiveness. In this work, we propose MUSEG, a novel RL-based method that enhances temporal understanding by introducing timestamp-aware multi-segment grounding. MUSEG enables MLLMs to align queries with multiple relevant video segments, promoting more comprehensive temporal reasoning. To facilitate effective learning, we design a customized RL training recipe with phased rewards that progressively guides the model toward temporally grounded reasoning. Extensive experiments on temporal grounding and time-sensitive video QA tasks demonstrate that MUSEG significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across diverse temporal understanding scenarios.

While significant progress has been achieved in distilling image datasets, extending DD to the video domain remains challenging due to the high dimensionality and temporal complexity inherent in video data. Existing video distillation (VD) methods often suffer from excessive computational costs and struggle to preserve temporal dynamics, as na\"ive extensions of image-based approaches typically lead to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose a novel uni-level video dataset distillation framework that directly optimizes synthetic videos with respect to a pre-trained model. To address temporal redundancy and enhance motion preservation, we introduce a temporal saliency-guided filtering mechanism that leverages inter-frame differences to guide the distillation process, encouraging the retention of informative temporal cues while suppressing frame-level redundancy. Extensive experiments on standard video benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, bridging the gap between real and distilled video data and offering a scalable solution for video dataset compression.</p></details> |  |

Automatically transforming NL into STL is an attractive approach to overcome the limitations of manual transformation, which is time-consuming and error-prone. However, due to the lack of datasets, automatic transformation currently faces significant challenges and has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an NL-STL dataset named STL-Diversity-Enhanced (STL-DivEn), which comprises 16,000 samples enriched with diverse patterns. To develop the dataset, we first manually create a small-scale seed set of NL-STL pairs. Next, representative examples are identified through clustering and used to guide large language models (LLMs) in generating additional NL-STL pairs. Finally, diversity and accuracy are ensured through rigorous rule-based filters and human validation. Furthermore, we introduce the Knowledge-Guided STL Transformation (KGST) framework, a novel approach for transforming natural language into STL, involving a generate-then-refine process based on external knowledge. Statistical analysis shows that the STL-DivEn dataset exhibits more diversity than the existing NL-STL dataset. Moreover, both metric-based and human evaluations indicate that our KGST approach outperforms baseline models in transformation accuracy on STL-DivEn and DeepSTL datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, published to ACL</p></details> |

Recent researches demonstrate data-driven neural networks surpass traditional statistical methods, especially when the analytical form of signals is hard to obtain, or noise is significant. However, most densely connected or convolution-based networks fail to fully exploit the spectral and temporal structure of scintillation signals, leaving large space for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a network architecture specially tailored for scintillation pulse characterization based on previous works on time series analysis. The core insight is that, by directly applying Fast Fourier Transform on original signals and utilizing different frequency components, the proposed network architecture can serve as a lightweight and enhanced representation learning backbone. We prove our idea in two case studies: (a) simulation data generated with the setting of the LUX dark matter detector, and (b) experimental electrical signals with fast electronics to emulate scintillation variations for the NICA/MPD calorimeter. The proposed model achieves significantly better results than the reference model in literature and densely connected models and demonstrates higher cost-efficiency than conventional machine learning methods.</p></details> | 30 pages, 14 figures |

However, this data-sharing scheme renders the system vulnerable to various malicious behaviors, as Byzantine agents can initiate cyberattacks by injecting sophisticated false data. To better investigate the impacts of malicious Byzantine faults, this paper develops a fully distributed P2P energy trading model by accounting for the high-fidelity physical network constraints. To further detect Byzantine faults and mitigate their impacts on distributed P2P energy trading problem, we propose an online spatial-temporal anomaly detection approach by leveraging the tensor learning method, which is informed by the domain knowledge to enable awesome detection performance. Moreover, to enhance its computational efficiency, we further develop closed-form solutions for the proposed detection approach. Subsequently, we derive theoretical conditions for guaranteeing optimality and convergence of the distributed P2P energy trading problem with anomaly detection mechanisms. Results from numerical simulations validate the effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

| **[Improving Trajectory Stitching with Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07802v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have shown great promise as trajectory planners, given their affinity to modeling complex distributions and guidable inference process. Previous works have successfully applied these in the context of robotic manipulation but perform poorly when the required solution does not exist as a complete trajectory within the training set. We identify that this is a result of being unable to plan via stitching, and subsequently address the architectural and dataset choices needed to remedy this. On top of this, we propose a novel addition to the training and inference procedures to both stabilize and enhance these capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating plans with out of distribution boundary conditions and performing obstacle avoidance on the Franka Panda in simulation and on real hardware. In both of these tasks our method performs significantly better than the baselines and is able to avoid obstacles up to four times as large.</p></details> |  |

Complex tasks can be accomplished through iterative clarifying questions and final responses generated by an LLM acting as a questioner (STaR-GATE; Andukuri et al., 2024}). However, existing approaches based on self-taught reasoning struggle to identify optimal dialogue trajectories and avoid irrelevant questions to the tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TO-GATE, a novel framework that enhances question generation through trajectory optimization, which consists of two key components: a clarification resolver that generates optimal questioning trajectories, and a summarizer that ensures task-aligned final responses. The trajectory optimization enables the model to produce effective elicitation questions and summary responses tailored to specific tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TO-GATE significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving a 9.32% improvement on standard preference elicitation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Sequence Editing for Biological and Clinical Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03569v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional generation models for longitudinal sequences can generate new or modified trajectories given a conditioning input. While effective at generating entire sequences, these models typically lack control over the timing and scope of the edits. Most existing approaches either operate on univariate sequences or assume that the condition affects all variables and time steps. However, many scientific and clinical applications require more precise interventions, where a condition takes effect only after a specific time and influences only a subset of variables. We introduce CLEF, a controllable sequence editing model for conditional generation of immediate and delayed effects in multivariate longitudinal sequences. CLEF learns temporal concepts that encode how and when a condition alters future sequence evolution. These concepts allow CLEF to apply targeted edits to the affected time steps and variables while preserving the rest of the sequence. We evaluate CLEF on 6 datasets spanning cellular reprogramming and patient health trajectories, comparing against 9 state-of-the-art baselines. CLEF improves immediate sequence editing accuracy by up to 36.01% (MAE). Unlike prior models, CLEF enables one-step conditional generation at arbitrary future times, outperforming them in delayed sequence editing by up to 65.71% (MAE). We test CLEF under counterfactual inference assumptions and show up to 63.19% (MAE) improvement on zero-shot conditional generation of counterfactual trajectories. In a case study of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, CLEF identifies clinical interventions that generate realistic counterfactual trajectories shifted toward healthier outcomes.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method, Exploration-Boosted MC-PILCO (EB-MC-PILCO), leverages iLQR to generate informative, exploratory trajectories and initialize the policy, significantly reducing the number of required optimization steps. Experiments on the cart-pole task demonstrate that EB-MC-PILCO accelerates convergence compared to standard MC-PILCO, achieving up to $\bm{45.9\%}$ reduction in execution time when both methods solve the task in four trials. EB-MC-PILCO also maintains a $\bm{100\%}$ success rate across trials while solving the task faster, even in cases where MC-PILCO converges in fewer iterations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrast & Compress: Learning Lightweight Embeddings for Short Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02571v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to retrieve semantically and directionally similar short-range trajectories with both accuracy and efficiency is foundational for downstream applications such as motion forecasting and autonomous navigation. However, prevailing approaches often depend on computationally intensive heuristics or latent anchor representations that lack interpretability and controllability. In this work, we propose a novel framework for learning fixed-dimensional embeddings for short trajectories by leveraging a Transformer encoder trained with a contrastive triplet loss that emphasize the importance of discriminative feature spaces for trajectory data. We analyze the influence of Cosine and FFT-based similarity metrics within the contrastive learning paradigm, with a focus on capturing the nuanced directional intent that characterizes short-term maneuvers. Our empirical evaluation on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates that embeddings shaped by Cosine similarity objectives yield superior clustering of trajectories by both semantic and directional attributes, outperforming FFT-based baselines in retrieval tasks. Notably, we show that compact Transformer architectures, even with low-dimensional embeddings (e.g., 16 dimensions, but qualitatively down to 4), achieve a compelling balance between retrieval performance (minADE, minFDE) and computational overhead, aligning with the growing demand for scalable and interpretable motion priors in real-time systems. The resulting embeddings provide a compact, semantically meaningful, and efficient representation of trajectory data, offering a robust alternative to heuristic similarity measures and paving the way for more transparent and controllable motion forecasting pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for peer review</p></details> |

The localization of point targets constitutes a fundamental problem in optical experimental mechanics, with extensive applications in various missions of UAVs. Localizing moving targets is crucial for analyzing their motion characteristics and dynamic properties. Reconstructing the trajectories of points from asynchronous cameras is a significant challenge. It encompasses two coupled sub-problems: trajectory reconstruction and camera synchronization. Present methods typically address only one of these sub-problems individually. This paper proposes a 3D trajectory reconstruction method for point targets based on asynchronous cameras, simultaneously solving both sub-problems. Firstly, we extend the trajectory intersection method to asynchronous cameras to resolve the limitation of traditional triangulation that requires camera synchronization. Secondly, we develop models for camera temporal information and target motion, based on imaging mechanisms and target dynamics characteristics. The parameters are optimized simultaneously to achieve trajectory reconstruction without accurate time parameters. Thirdly, we optimize the camera rotations alongside the camera time information and target motion parameters, using tighter and more continuous constraints on moving points. The reconstruction accuracy is significantly improved, especially when the camera rotations are inaccurate. Finally, the simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. The real-world results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieved a localization error of 112.95 m at an observation range of 15 ~ 20 km.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Acta Mechanica Sinica</p></details> |

However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fuxiao0719.github.io/projects/robomaster/ Code: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/RoboMaster</p></details> |

These problems are modeled by partially observable stochastic games (POSGs), but planning in fully continuous POSGs is intractable without heavy offline computation or assumptions on the order of belief maintained by each player. We formulate a finite history/horizon refinement of POSGs which admits competitive information gathering behavior in trajectory space, and through a series of approximations, we present an online method for computing rational trajectory plans in these games which leverages particle-based estimations of the joint state space and performs stochastic gradient play. We also provide the necessary adjustments required to deploy this method on individual agents. The method is tested in continuous pursuit-evasion and warehouse-pickup scenarios (alongside extensions to $N > 2$ players and to more complex environments with visual and physical obstacles), demonstrating evidence of active information gathering and outperforming passive competitors.</p></details> | Accepted at RSS 2025 |
| **[WHEN TO ACT, WHEN TO WAIT: Modeling Structural Trajectories for Intent Triggerability in Task-Oriented Dialogue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01881v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task-oriented dialogue systems often face difficulties when user utterances seem semantically complete but lack necessary structural information for appropriate system action. This arises because users frequently do not fully understand their own needs, while systems require precise intent definitions. Current LLM-based agents cannot effectively distinguish between linguistically complete and contextually triggerable expressions, lacking frameworks for collaborative intent formation. We present STORM, a framework modeling asymmetric information dynamics through conversations between UserLLM (full internal access) and AgentLLM (observable behavior only). STORM produces annotated corpora capturing expression trajectories and latent cognitive transitions, enabling systematic analysis of collaborative understanding development. Our contributions include: (1) formalizing asymmetric information processing in dialogue systems; (2) modeling intent formation tracking collaborative understanding evolution; and (3) evaluation metrics measuring internal cognitive improvements alongside task performance. Experiments across four language models reveal that moderate uncertainty (40-60%) can outperform complete transparency in certain scenarios, with model-specific patterns suggesting reconsideration of optimal information completeness in human-AI collaboration. These findings contribute to understanding asymmetric reasoning dynamics and inform uncertainty-calibrated dialogue system design.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 31 figures.

In this context, constrained diversity optimization has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning (RL) framework to train a diverse set of agents in parallel. However, existing constrained-diversity RL methods often under-explore in complex tasks such as robotic manipulation, leading to a lack in policy diversity. To improve diversity optimization in RL, we therefore propose a curriculum that first explores at the trajectory level before learning step-based policies. In our empirical evaluation, we provide novel insights into the shortcoming of skill-based diversity optimization, and demonstrate empirically that our curriculum improves the diversity of the learned skills.</p></details> |  |

Despite its growing prominence, the field lacks a systematic and unified survey that consolidates essential knowledge and advancements in this domain. This paper addresses this gap by providing the first comprehensive review of the field, covering from foundational definitions to advanced methodologies. We introduce the different approaches to camera representation and present an in-depth review of available camera trajectory generation models, starting with rule-based approaches and progressing through optimization-based techniques, machine learning advancements, and hybrid methods that integrate multiple strategies. Additionally, we gather and analyze the metrics and datasets commonly used for evaluating camera trajectory systems, offering insights into how these tools measure performance, aesthetic quality, and practical applicability. Finally, we highlight existing limitations, critical gaps in current research, and promising opportunities for investment and innovation in the field. This paper not only serves as a foundational resource for researchers entering the field but also paves the way for advancing adaptive, efficient, and creative camera trajectory systems across diverse applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[State-Covering Trajectory Stitching for Diffusion Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00895v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models are emerging as powerful tools for long-horizon planning in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with offline datasets. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Predicting Any Human Trajectory In Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00871v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for adaptability in different environments and domains. A common approach involves collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via backpropagation. However, this process is often impractical on edge devices due to constrained computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enables rapid adaptation without fine-tuning on the scenario-specific data. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public benchmarks. The code will be released at https://fujiry0.github.io/TrajICL-project-page.</p></details> |  |
| **[KG-TRACES: Enhancing Large Language Models with Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning and Attribution Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00783v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various natural language processing tasks, but their performance on complex reasoning problems remains hindered by a lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/KG-TRACES.</p></details> | 23 pages, 13 figures |

Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modeling. However, the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks make effective and reliable trajectory modeling an important yet highly challenging endeavor, even for domain experts. In this paper, we propose \textit{TrajAgent}, a agent framework powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to facilitate robust and efficient trajectory modeling through automation modeling. This framework leverages and optimizes diverse specialized models to address various trajectory modeling tasks across different datasets effectively. In \textit{TrajAgent}, we first develop \textit{UniEnv}, an execution environment with a unified data and model interface, to support the execution and training of various models. Building on \textit{UniEnv}, we introduce an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modeling across various trajectory tasks and data. Furthermore, we introduce collaborative learning schema between LLM-based agents and small speciallized models, to enhance the performance of the whole framework effectively. Extensive experiments on four tasks using four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{TrajAgent} in automated trajectory modeling, achieving a performance improvement of 2.38\%-34.96\% over baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>the c...</summary><p>the code will be openly accessible at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/TrajAgent</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Large Vision Model in Street Scene Semantic Understanding through Leveraging Posterior Optimization Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01710v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To improve the generalization of the autonomous driving (AD) perception model, vehicles need to update the model over time based on the continuously collected data. As time progresses, the amount of data fitted by the AD model expands, which helps to improve the AD model generalization substantially. However, such ever-expanding data is a double-edged sword for the AD model. Specifically, as the fitted data volume grows to exceed the the AD model's fitting capacities, the AD model is prone to under-fitting. To address this issue, we propose to use a pretrained Large Vision Models (LVMs) as backbone coupled with downstream perception head to understand AD semantic information. This design can not only surmount the aforementioned under-fitting problem due to LVMs' powerful fitting capabilities, but also enhance the perception generalization thanks to LVMs' vast and diverse training data. On the other hand, to mitigate vehicles' computational burden of training the perception head while running LVM backbone, we introduce a Posterior Optimization Trajectory (POT)-Guided optimization scheme (POTGui) to accelerate the convergence. Concretely, we propose a POT Generator (POTGen) to generate posterior (future) optimization direction in advance to guide the current optimization iteration, through which the model can generally converge within 10 epochs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance by over 66.48\% and converges faster over 6 times, compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Rule-based planners are efficient but lack generalization, while learning-based planners excel in generalization yet have limitations in real-time performance and interpretability. In long-tail scenarios, these challenges make planning particularly difficult. To leverage the strengths of both rule-based and learning-based planners, we proposed the Scenario-Aware Hybrid Planner (SAH-Drive) for closed-loop vehicle trajectory planning. Inspired by human driving behavior, SAH-Drive combines a lightweight rule-based planner and a comprehensive learning-based planner, utilizing a dual-timescale decision neuron to determine the final trajectory. To enhance the computational efficiency and robustness of the hybrid planner, we also employed a diffusion proposal number regulator and a trajectory fusion module. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the generalization capability of the planning system, achieving state-of-the-art performance in interPlan, while maintaining computational efficiency without incurring substantial additional runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, International Conference on Machine Learning</p></details> |
| **[Explorer: Scaling Exploration-driven Web Trajectory Synthesis for Multimodal Web Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11357v4)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent success in large multimodal models (LMMs) has sparked promising applications of agents capable of autonomously completing complex web tasks. While open-source LMM agents have made significant advances in offline evaluation benchmarks, their performance still falls substantially short of human-level capabilities in more realistic online settings. A key bottleneck is the lack of diverse and large-scale trajectory-level datasets across various domains, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a scalable recipe to synthesize the largest and most diverse trajectory-level dataset to date, containing over 94K successful multimodal web trajectories, spanning 49K unique URLs, 720K screenshots, and 33M web elements. In particular, we leverage extensive web exploration and refinement to obtain diverse task intents. The average cost is 28 cents per successful trajectory, making it affordable to a wide range of users in the community. Leveraging this dataset, we train Explorer, a multimodal web agent, and demonstrate strong performance on both offline and online web agent benchmarks such as Mind2Web-Live, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and MiniWob++. Additionally, our experiments highlight data scaling as a key driver for improving web agent capabilities. We hope this study makes state-of-the-art LMM-based agent research at a larger scale more accessible.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Findings) |

Modeling hand-object interaction priors holds significant potential to advance robotic and embodied AI systems in learning to operate effectively within the physical world. We introduce SIGHT, a novel task focused on generating realistic and physically plausible 3D hand-object interaction trajectories from a single image and a brief language-based task description. Prior work on hand-object trajectory generation typically relies on textual input that lacks explicit grounding to the target object, or assumes access to 3D object meshes, which are often considerably more difficult to obtain than 2D images. We propose SIGHT-Fusion, a novel diffusion-based image-text conditioned generative model that tackles this task by retrieving the most similar 3D object mesh from a database and enforcing geometric hand-object interaction constraints via a novel inference-time diffusion guidance. We benchmark our model on the HOI4D and H2O datasets, adapting relevant baselines for this novel task. Experiments demonstrate our superior performance in the diversity and quality of generated trajectories, as well as in hand-object interaction geometry metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Trajectory, One Token: Grounded Video Tokenization via Panoptic Sub-object Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23617v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective video tokenization is critical for scaling transformer models for long videos. Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches, leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles, ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with 10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2% performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks, making it a robust and scalable solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive Meta-Actions for Unified Controllable Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23612v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable trajectory generation guided by high-level semantic decisions, termed meta-actions, is crucial for autonomous driving systems. A significant limitation of existing frameworks is their reliance on invariant meta-actions assigned over fixed future time intervals, causing temporal misalignment with the actual behavior trajectories. This misalignment leads to irrelevant associations between the prescribed meta-actions and the resulting trajectories, disrupting task coherence and limiting model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Autoregressive Meta-Actions, an approach integrated into autoregressive trajectory generation frameworks that provides a unified and precise definition for meta-action-conditioned trajectory prediction. Specifically, We decompose traditional long-interval meta-actions into frame-level meta-actions, enabling a sequential interplay between autoregressive meta-action prediction and meta-action-conditioned trajectory generation. This decomposition ensures strict alignment between each trajectory segment and its corresponding meta-action, achieving a consistent and unified task formulation across the entire trajectory span and significantly reducing complexity. Moreover, we propose a staged pre-training process to decouple the learning of basic motion dynamics from the integration of high-level decision control, which offers flexibility, stability, and modularity. Experimental results validate our framework's effectiveness, demonstrating improved trajectory adaptivity and responsiveness to dynamic decision-making scenarios. We provide the video document and dataset, which are available at https://arma-traj.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations or preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle to address long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. We finally leverage these calibrated trajectories with successful trajectories for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that timely calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness.

We propose a centroidal online trajectory generation and stabilization control for humanoid dynamic multi-contact motion. The proposed method features the drastic reduction of the computational cost by using preview control instead of the conventional model predictive control that considers the constraints of all sample times. By combining preview control with centroidal state feedback for robustness to disturbances and wrench distribution for satisfying contact constraints, we show that the robot can stably perform a variety of multi-contact motions through simulation experiments.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TRACE (Trajectory-Constrained Attentional Concept Erasure)}, a novel method to erase targeted concepts from diffusion models while preserving overall generative quality. Our approach combines a rigorous theoretical framework, establishing formal conditions under which a concept can be provably suppressed in the diffusion process, with an effective fine-tuning procedure compatible with both conventional latent diffusion (Stable Diffusion) and emerging rectified flow models (e.g.~FLUX). We first derive a closed-form update to the model's cross-attention layers that removes hidden representations of the target concept. We then introduce a trajectory-aware finetuning objective that steers the denoising process away from the concept only in the late sampling stages, thus maintaining the model's fidelity on unrelated content. Empirically, we evaluate TRACE on multiple benchmarks used in prior concept erasure studies (object classes, celebrity faces, artistic styles, and explicit content from the I2P dataset). TRACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent methods such as ANT, EraseAnything, and MACE in terms of removal efficacy and output quality.</p></details> | In peer review |
| **[Universal Trajectory Optimization Framework for Differential Drive Robot Class](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07924v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential drive robots are widely used in various scenarios thanks to their straightforward principle, from household service robots to disaster response field robots. There are several types of driving mechanisms for real-world applications, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled skid-steering, tracked robots, and so on. The differences in the driving mechanisms usually require specific kinematic modeling when precise control is desired. Furthermore, the nonholonomic dynamics and possible lateral slip lead to different degrees of difficulty in getting feasible and high-quality trajectories. Therefore, a comprehensive trajectory optimization framework to compute trajectories efficiently for various kinds of differential drive robots is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a universal trajectory optimization framework that can be applied to differential drive robots, enabling the generation of high-quality trajectories within a restricted computational timeframe. We introduce a novel trajectory representation based on polynomial parameterization of motion states or their integrals, such as angular and linear velocities, which inherently matches the robots' motion to the control principle. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize complexity while prioritizing safety and operational efficiency. We then build a full-stack autonomous planning and control system to demonstrate its feasibility and robustness. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world testing in crowded environments with three kinds of differential drive robots to validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |

In this paper, we leverage ideas from generative modeling of image data to push the boundary of time series generation. For this, we find new generators of SDEs and jump processes, inspired by trajectory flow matching, that have the marginal distributions of the time series of interest. Specifically, we can handle discontinuities of the underlying processes by parameterizing the jump kernel densities by scaled Gaussians that allow for closed form formulas of the corresponding Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss. Unlike most other approaches, we are able to handle irregularly sampled time series.</p></details> |  |

While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProDiff: Prototype-Guided Diffusion for Minimal Information Trajectory Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23048v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data is crucial for various applications but often suffers from incompleteness due to device limitations and diverse collection scenarios. Existing imputation methods rely on sparse trajectory or travel information, such as velocity, to infer missing points. However, these approaches assume that sparse trajectories retain essential behavioral patterns, which place significant demands on data acquisition and overlook the potential of large-scale human trajectory embeddings. To address this, we propose ProDiff, a trajectory imputation framework that uses only two endpoints as minimal information. It integrates prototype learning to embed human movement patterns and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model for robust spatiotemporal reconstruction. Joint training with a tailored loss function ensures effective imputation. ProDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving accuracy by 6.28\% on FourSquare and 2.52\% on WuXi. Further analysis shows a 0.927 correlation between generated and real trajectories, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to prior methods that address these motion types through separate modules or task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones.

Traditional MPI reconstruction relies on either time-consuming calibration (measured system matrix) or model-based simulation of the forward operator. Recent developments have shown the applicability of Chebyshev polynomials to multi-dimensional Lissajous Field-Free Point (FFP) scans. This method is bound to the particular choice of sinusoidal scanning trajectories. In this paper, we present the first reconstruction on real 2D MPI data with a trajectory-independent model-based MPI reconstruction algorithm. We further develop the zero-shot Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithm of the authors -- with automatic noise level estimation -- to address the present deconvolution problem, leveraging a state-of-the-art denoiser trained on natural images without retraining on MPI-specific data. We evaluate our method on the publicly available 2D FFP MPI dataset ``MPIdata: Equilibrium Model with Anisotropy", featuring scans of six phantoms acquired using a Bruker preclinical scanner. Moreover, we show reconstruction performed on custom data on a 2D scanner with additional high-frequency excitation field and partial data.

We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach remains primarily acoustic and lacks articulatory constraints. In this study, the same 75 VCVs are analyzed, but generated with the Maeda model, using trajectory planning that differentiates vowel-to-vowel transitions from consonantal influences. Synthetic data exhibit similar characteristics to Ohman's sequences, including the presence of S-shaped F2 trajectories. Furthermore, locus equations (LEs) for F2 and F3 are computed from synthetic CV data to investigate their underlying determinism, leading to a reassessment of conventional interpretations. The findings indicate that, although articulatory planning is structured separately for vowel and consonant groups, S-shaped F2 trajectories emerge from a composite mechanism governed by the coordinated synergy of all articulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

This study categorizes such misalignments into three types: (1) lack of functions to express intent, (2) inefficient action sequences, and (3) incorrect intentions that cannot solve the task. To address these issues, we first formalize and define these three misalignment types in a unified framework. We then propose a heuristic algorithm to detect misalignments in ARCTraj trajectories and analyze their impact hierarchically and quantitatively. We also present an intention estimation method based on our formalism that infers missing alignment between user actions and intentions. Through trajectory alignment, we experimentally demonstrate that AI models trained on human task-solving trajectories improve performance in mimicking human reasoning. Based on hierarchical analysis and experiments, we highlight the importance of trajectory-intention alignment and demonstrate the effectiveness of intention-aligned training.</p></details> | KDD 2025 accepted |
| **[Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction in the Crash Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16349v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction methods have been widely applied in autonomous driving technologies. Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoMaPOI: A Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Next POI Prediction Bridging the Gap Between Trajectory and Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23837v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for the next Point-Of-Interest (POI) prediction task, leveraging their capabilities in semantic understanding of POI trajectories. However, previous LLM-based methods, which are superficially adapted to next POI prediction, largely overlook critical challenges associated with applying LLMs to this task. Specifically, LLMs encounter two critical challenges: (1) a lack of intrinsic understanding of numeric spatiotemporal data, which hinders accurate modeling of users' spatiotemporal distributions and preferences; and (2) an excessively large and unconstrained candidate POI space, which often results in random or irrelevant predictions. To address these issues, we propose a Collaborative Multi Agent Framework for Next POI Prediction, named CoMaPOI. Through the close interaction of three specialized agents (Profiler, Forecaster, and Predictor), CoMaPOI collaboratively addresses the two critical challenges. The Profiler agent is responsible for converting numeric data into language descriptions, enhancing semantic understanding. The Forecaster agent focuses on dynamically constraining and refining the candidate POI space. The Predictor agent integrates this information to generate high-precision predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (NYC, TKY, and CA) demonstrate that CoMaPOI achieves state of the art performance, improving all metrics by 5% to 10% compared to SOTA baselines. This work pioneers the investigation of challenges associated with applying LLMs to complex spatiotemporal tasks by leveraging tailored collaborative agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

By employing quantum concepts and a quantum search algorithm, this work presents the implementation and optimization of the agent-environment interactions entirely within the quantum domain, eliminating reliance on classical computations. Key contributions include the quantum-based state transitions, return calculation, and trajectory search mechanism that utilize quantum principles to demonstrate the realization of RL processes through quantum phenomena. The implementation emphasizes the fundamental role of quantum superposition in enhancing computational efficiency for RL tasks. Results demonstrate the capacity of a quantum model to achieve quantum enhancement in RL, highlighting the potential of fully quantum implementations in decision-making tasks. This work not only underscores the applicability of quantum computing in machine learning but also contributes to the field of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) by offering a robust framework for understanding and exploiting quantum computing in RL systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Weight Diffusion: Generating reactive policies instead of trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14040v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has emerged as a viable approach for both robot manipulation and locomotion. Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost, namely, larger model size and slower inference. This is especially an issue for robotic tasks that require high control frequency. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (DP), a popular model for generating trajectories: fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. For these reasons, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to generate closed-loop policies (weights for neural policies) for robotic tasks, rather than generating trajectories. Learning the behavior distribution through parameter space over trajectory space offers two key advantages: longer action horizons (fewer diffusion queries) & robustness to perturbations while retaining high performance; and a lower inference compute cost. To this end, we show that LWD has higher success rates than DP when the action horizon is longer and when stochastic perturbations exist in the environment. Furthermore, LWD achieves multitask performance comparable to DP while requiring just ~1/45th of the inference-time FLOPS</p></details> |  |
| **[Streaming Flow Policy: Simplifying diffusion$/$flow-matching policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21851v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion$/$flow-matching policies have enabled imitation learning of complex, multi-modal action trajectories. However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.

However, existing learning-based planning methods often rely on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting unsafe behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a novel two-stage trajectory planning framework that formulates trajectory planning as a sequential prediction task, guided by explicit planning principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. In the first stage, we train an autoregressive trajectory predictor via next motion token prediction on expert data. In the second stage, we design rule-based rewards (e.g., collision avoidance, speed limits) and fine-tune the model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning strategy, to align its predictions with these planning principles. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that our Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be made public soon.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose IKMo, an image-keyframed motion generation method based on the diffusion model with trajectory and pose being decoupled. The trajectory and pose inputs go through a two-stage conditioning framework. In the first stage, the dedicated optimization module is applied to refine inputs. In the second stage, trajectory and pose are encoded via a Trajectory Encoder and a Pose Encoder in parallel. Then, motion with high spatial and semantic fidelity is guided by a motion ControlNet, which processes the fused trajectory and pose data. Experiment results based on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art on all metrics under trajectory-keyframe constraints. In addition, MLLM-based agents are implemented to pre-process model inputs. Given texts and keyframe images from users, the agents extract motion descriptions, keyframe poses, and trajectories as the optimized inputs into the motion generation model. We conducts a user study with 10 participants. The experiment results prove that the MLLM-based agents pre-processing makes generated motion more in line with users' expectation. We believe that the proposed method improves both the fidelity and controllability of motion generation by the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamical ON-OFF Control with Trajectory Prediction for Multi-RIS Wireless Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20887v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to reconfigure wireless environments by dynamically controlling the phase, amplitude, and polarization of impinging waves. However, as nearly passive reflective metasurfaces, RISs may not distinguish between desired and interference signals, which can lead to severe spectrum pollution and even affect performance negatively. In particular, in large-scale networks, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiving node can be degraded due to excessive interference reflected from the RIS. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose in this paper a trajectory prediction-based dynamical control algorithm (TPC) for anticipating RIS ON-OFF states sequence, integrating a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) scheme to predict user trajectories. In particular, through a codebook-based algorithm, the RIS controller adaptively coordinates the configuration of the RIS elements to maximize the received SINR. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TPC method over various system settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing OPE methods are ineffective for high-dimensional, long-horizon problems, due to exponential blow-ups in variance from importance weighting or compounding errors from learned dynamics models. To address these challenges, we propose STITCH-OPE, a model-based generative framework that leverages denoising diffusion for long-horizon OPE in high-dimensional state and action spaces. Starting with a diffusion model pre-trained on the behavior data, STITCH-OPE generates synthetic trajectories from the target policy by guiding the denoising process using the score function of the target policy. STITCH-OPE proposes two technical innovations that make it advantageous for OPE: (1) prevents over-regularization by subtracting the score of the behavior policy during guidance, and (2) generates long-horizon trajectories by stitching partial trajectories together end-to-end. We provide a theoretical guarantee that under mild assumptions, these modifications result in an exponential reduction in variance versus long-horizon trajectory diffusion. Experiments on the D4RL and OpenAI Gym benchmarks show substantial improvement in mean squared error, correlation, and regret metrics compared to state-of-the-art OPE methods.</p></details> |  |

Facing the dual eavesdropping threats, we aim to enhance the average achievable secrecy rate for the communication user by jointly designing the UAV trajectory together with the transmit information and sensing beamforming, while satisfying the requirements on sensing performance and sensing security, as well as the UAV power and flight constraints. To address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we employ the alternating optimization (AO) strategy, jointly with the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods. Numerical results validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to achieve a high secrecy rate while meeting the required sensing and security constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted for possible publication.

| **[RRO: LLM Agent Optimization Through Rising Reward Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20737v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited extraordinary performance in a variety of tasks while it remains challenging for them to solve complex multi-step tasks as agents. In practice, agents sensitive to the outcome of certain key steps which makes them likely to fail the task because of a subtle mistake in the planning trajectory. Recent approaches resort to calibrating the reasoning process through reinforcement learning. They reward or penalize every reasoning step with process supervision, as known as Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, PRMs are difficult and costly to scale up with a large number of next action candidates since they require extensive computations to acquire the training data through the per-step trajectory exploration. To mitigate this issue, we focus on the relative reward trend across successive reasoning steps and propose maintaining an increasing reward in the collected trajectories for process supervision, which we term Reward Rising Optimization (RRO). Specifically, we incrementally augment the process supervision until identifying a step exhibiting positive reward differentials, i.e. rising rewards, relative to its preceding iteration. This method dynamically expands the search space for the next action candidates, efficiently capturing high-quality data. We provide mathematical groundings and empirical results on the WebShop and InterCode-SQL benchmarks, showing that our proposed RRO achieves superior performance while requiring much less exploration cost.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Towards Human-Like Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving: A Behavior-Centric Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21565v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the trajectories of vehicles is crucial for the development of autonomous driving (AD) systems, particularly in complex and dynamic traffic environments. In this study, we introduce HiT (Human-like Trajectory Prediction), a novel model designed to enhance trajectory prediction by incorporating behavior-aware modules and dynamic centrality measures. Unlike traditional methods that primarily rely on static graph structures, HiT leverages a dynamic framework that accounts for both direct and indirect interactions among traffic participants. This allows the model to capture the subtle yet significant influences of surrounding vehicles, enabling more accurate and human-like predictions. To evaluate HiT's performance, we conducted extensive experiments using diverse and challenging real-world datasets, including NGSIM, HighD, RounD, ApolloScape, and MoCAD++. The results demonstrate that HiT consistently outperforms other top models across multiple metrics, particularly excelling in scenarios involving aggressive driving behaviors. This research presents a significant step forward in trajectory prediction, offering a more reliable and interpretable approach for enhancing the safety and efficiency of fully autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

Instead of producing an unordered set of views independently or simultaneously, we generate a sequence of views, leveraging temporal consistency to enhance 3D coherence. More importantly, our view sequence is not determined by a pre-determined and fixed camera setup. Instead, we compute an adaptive camera trajectory (ACT), forming an orbit, which seeks to maximize the visibility of occluded regions of the 3D object to be reconstructed. Once the best orbit is found, we feed it to a video diffusion model to generate novel views around the orbit, which can then be passed to any multi-view 3D reconstruction model to obtain the final result. Our multi-view synthesis pipeline is quite efficient since it involves no run-time training/optimization, only forward inferences by applying pre-trained models for occlusion analysis and multi-view synthesis. Our method predicts camera trajectories that reveal occlusions effectively and produce consistent novel views, significantly improving 3D reconstruction over SOTA alternatives on the unseen GSO dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[OSVI-WM: One-Shot Visual Imitation for Unseen Tasks using World-Model-Guided Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20425v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual imitation learning enables robotic agents to acquire skills by observing expert demonstration videos. In the one-shot setting, the agent generates a policy after observing a single expert demonstration without additional fine-tuning. Existing approaches typically train and evaluate on the same set of tasks, varying only object configurations, and struggle to generalize to unseen tasks with different semantic or structural requirements. While some recent methods attempt to address this, they exhibit low success rates on hard test tasks that, despite being visually similar to some training tasks, differ in context and require distinct responses. Additionally, most existing methods lack an explicit model of environment dynamics, limiting their ability to reason about future states. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for one-shot visual imitation learning via world-model-guided trajectory generation. Given an expert demonstration video and the agent's initial observation, our method leverages a learned world model to predict a sequence of latent states and actions. This latent trajectory is then decoded into physical waypoints that guide the agent's execution. Our method is evaluated on two simulated benchmarks and three real-world robotic platforms, where it consistently outperforms prior approaches, with over 30% improvement in some cases.</p></details> |  |

However, current powerful agents often depend on sophisticated prompt engineering combined with closed-source LLMs like GPT-4. Although training open-source LLMs using expert trajectories from teacher models has yielded some improvements in agent capabilities, this approach still faces limitations such as performance plateauing and error propagation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose STeP, a novel method for improving LLM-based agent training. We synthesize self-reflected trajectories that include reflections and corrections of error steps, which enhance the effectiveness of LLM agents in learning from teacher models, enabling them to become agents capable of self-reflecting and correcting. We also introduce partial masking strategy that prevents the LLM from internalizing incorrect or suboptimal steps. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves agent performance across three representative tasks: ALFWorld, WebShop, and SciWorld. For the open-source model LLaMA2-7B-Chat, when trained using self-reflected trajectories constructed with Qwen1.5-110B-Chat as the teacher model, it achieves comprehensive improvements with less training data compared to agents trained exclusively on expert trajectories.</p></details> |  |

By conceptualizing reasoning trajectories as pseudo-gradient descent updates to the LLM's parameters, we identify parallels between LLM reasoning and various meta-learning paradigms. We formalize the training process for reasoning tasks as a meta-learning setup, with each question treated as an individual task, and reasoning trajectories serving as the inner loop optimization for adapting model parameters. Once trained on a diverse set of questions, the LLM develops fundamental reasoning capabilities that can generalize to previously unseen questions. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the strong connection between LLM reasoning and meta-learning, exploring several issues of significant interest from a meta-learning standpoint. Our work not only enhances the understanding of LLM reasoning but also provides practical insights for improving these models through established meta-learning techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v2)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches face critical limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for efficient deep search systems.

| **[Echo Planning for Autonomous Driving: From Current Observations to Future Trajectories and Back](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18945v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern end-to-end autonomous driving systems suffer from a critical limitation: their planners lack mechanisms to enforce temporal consistency between predicted trajectories and evolving scene dynamics. This absence of self-supervision allows early prediction errors to compound catastrophically over time. We introduce Echo Planning, a novel self-correcting framework that establishes a closed-loop Current - Future - Current (CFC) cycle to harmonize trajectory prediction with scene coherence. Our key insight is that plausible future trajectories must be bi-directionally consistent, ie, not only generated from current observations but also capable of reconstructing them. The CFC mechanism first predicts future trajectories from the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) scene representation, then inversely maps these trajectories back to estimate the current BEV state. By enforcing consistency between the original and reconstructed BEV representations through a cycle loss, the framework intrinsically penalizes physically implausible or misaligned trajectories. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, reducing L2 error by 0.04 m and collision rate by 0.12% compared to one-shot planners. Crucially, our method requires no additional supervision, leveraging the CFC cycle as an inductive bias for robust planning. This work offers a deployable solution for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Flow Matching for Geometric Trajectory Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18647v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The simulation of N-body systems is a fundamental problem with applications in a wide range of fields, such as molecular dynamics, biochemistry, and pedestrian dynamics. Machine learning has become an invaluable tool for scaling physics-based simulators and developing models directly from experimental data. In particular, recent advances based on deep generative modeling and geometric deep learning have enabled probabilistic simulation by modeling complex distributions over trajectories while respecting the permutation symmetry that is fundamental to N-body systems. However, to generate realistic trajectories, existing methods must learn complex transformations starting from uninformed noise and do not allow for the exploitation of domain-informed priors. In this work, we propose STFlow to address this limitation. By leveraging flow matching and data-dependent couplings, STFlow facilitates physics-informed simulation of geometric trajectories without sacrificing model expressivity or scalability. Our evaluation on N-body dynamical systems, molecular dynamics, and pedestrian dynamics benchmarks shows that STFlow produces significantly lower prediction errors while enabling more efficient inference, highlighting the benefits of employing physics-informed prior distributions in probabilistic geometric trajectory modeling.</p></details> | 20 pages, 17 figures |

The lack of analytical expression for the trailer's errors to the center line pose a great challenge to the trajectory planning for tractor-trailer vehicles. To address this issue, we first use geometric representations to characterize the lateral and orientation errors in Cartesian frame, where the errors would serve as the components of the cost function and the road edge constraints within our optimization process. Next, we generate a coarse trajectory to warm-start the subsequent optimization problems. On the other hand, to achieve a good approximation of the continuous-time kinematics, optimization-based methods usually discretize the kinematics with a large sampling number. This leads to an increase in the number of the variables and constraints, thus making the optimization problem difficult to solve. To address this issue, we design a Progressively Increasing Sampling Number Optimization (PISNO) framework. More specifically, we first find a nearly feasible trajectory with a small sampling number to warm-start the optimization process. Then, the sampling number is progressively increased, and the corresponding intermediate Optimal Control Problem (OCP) is solved in each iteration. Next, we further resample the obtained solution into a finer sampling period, and then use it to warm-start the intermediate OCP in next iteration. This process is repeated until reaching a threshold sampling number. Simulation and experiment results show the proposed method exhibits a good performance and less computational consumption over the benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Do You Need for Diverse Trajectory Stitching in Diffusion Planning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18083v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In planning, stitching is an ability of algorithms to piece together sub-trajectories of data they are trained on to generate new and diverse behaviours. While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably stitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties are needed to compose: \emph{positional equivariance} and \emph{local receptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion planning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling. Experimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than positional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition, both are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple architecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive methods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based guidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable generalization in goal-conditioned settings.</p></details> | 9 Pages |

At the upper tier, a lightweight behavior-cloning network consumes six-axis force/torque streams from dual wrist-mounted sensors and outputs whole-body planar velocity commands that capture the leader's applied forces. At the lower tier, a deep-reinforcement-learning policy, trained under randomized payloads (0-3 kg) and friction conditions in Isaac Gym and validated in MuJoCo and on a real Unitree G1, maps these high-level twists to stable, under-load joint trajectories. By decoupling intent interpretation (force -> velocity) from legged locomotion (velocity -> joints), our method combines intuitive responsiveness to human inputs with robust, load-adaptive walking. We collect training data without motion-capture or markers, only synchronized RGB video and F/T readings, employing SAM2 and WHAM to extract 3D human pose and velocity. In real-world trials, our humanoid achieves cooperative carry-and-move performance (completion time, trajectory deviation, velocity synchrony, and follower-force) on par with a blindfolded human-follower baseline.

However, existing methods for trajectory retrieval face notable limitations, including inefficiencies in large-scale data, lack of support for condition-based queries, and reliance on trajectory similarity measures. To address the above challenges, we propose OmniTraj, a generalized and flexible omni-semantic trajectory retrieval framework that integrates four complementary modalities or semantics -- raw trajectories, topology, road segments, and regions -- into a unified system. Unlike traditional approaches that are limited to computing and processing trajectories as a single modality, OmniTraj designs dedicated encoders for each modality, which are embedded and fused into a shared representation space. This design enables OmniTraj to support accurate and flexible queries based on any individual modality or combination thereof, overcoming the rigidity of traditional similarity-based methods. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniTraj in handling large-scale data, providing flexible, multi-modality queries, and supporting downstream tasks and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper by KDD'25 - Research Track</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory-Independent Flexibility Envelopes of Energy-Constrained Systems with State-Dependent Losses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16396v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As non-dispatchable renewable power units become prominent in electric power grids, demand-side flexibility appears as a key element of future power systems' operation. Power and energy bounds are intuitive metrics to describe the flexibility of energy-constrained loads. However, to be used in operation, any power consumption trajectory fulfilling the power and energy bounds must necessarily fulfill the load's constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that energy bounds defined as the minimum and maximum energy consumption potential of a load with state-dependent losses are Trajectory-Dependent (TD), i.e., for any energy value in the bounds a feasible power trajectory exists, but not all power trajectories enclosed in the energy envelopes satisfy the load's constraints. To guarantee the satisfaction of load constraints for all trajectories, we define Trajectory-Independent (TI) energy bounds. We present TI envelope formulations for individual loads, as well as physically coupled loads and assess the proposed formulations in a building heating system, a system with state-dependent losses. We find that using a TD envelope as energy bounds in operation may yield room temperature up to 3.8{\deg}C higher and 3.4{\deg}C lower than admissible. Overall, poorly insulated buildings observe a TI energy envelope that differs significantly from their TD envelope.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Trajectory Matching for Small-Scale Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15267v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying machine learning models in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices or rapid prototyping scenarios, increasingly demands distillation of large datasets into significantly smaller yet informative synthetic datasets. Current dataset distillation techniques, particularly Trajectory Matching methods, optimize synthetic data so that the model's training trajectory on synthetic samples mirrors that on real data. While demonstrating efficacy on medium-scale synthetic datasets, these methods fail to adequately preserve semantic richness under extreme sample scarcity. To address this limitation, we propose a novel dataset distillation method integrating contrastive learning during image synthesis. By explicitly maximizing instance-level feature discrimination, our approach produces more informative and diverse synthetic samples, even when dataset sizes are significantly constrained. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating contrastive learning substantially enhances the performance of models trained on very small-scale synthetic datasets. This integration not only guides more effective feature representation but also significantly improves the visual fidelity of the synthesized images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves notable performance improvements over existing distillation techniques, especially in scenarios with extremely limited synthetic data.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Toward Theoretical Insights into Diffusion Trajectory Distillation via Operator Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16024v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion trajectory distillation methods aim to accelerate sampling in diffusion models, which produce high-quality outputs but suffer from slow sampling speeds. These methods train a student model to approximate the multi-step denoising process of a pretrained teacher model in a single step, enabling one-shot generation. However, theoretical insights into the trade-off between different distillation strategies and generative quality remain limited, complicating their optimization and selection. In this work, we take a first step toward addressing this gap. Specifically, we reinterpret trajectory distillation as an operator merging problem in the linear regime, where each step of the teacher model is represented as a linear operator acting on noisy data. These operators admit a clear geometric interpretation as projections and rescalings corresponding to the noise schedule. During merging, signal shrinkage occurs as a convex combination of operators, arising from both discretization and limited optimization time of the student model. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal merging strategy that maximally preserves signal fidelity. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence of a sharp phase transition in the optimal strategy, governed by data covariance structures. Our findings enhance the theoretical understanding of diffusion trajectory distillation and offer practical insights for improving distillation strategies.</p></details> | 31 pages, 19 figures |

To address these issues, we propose SwarmDiff, a hierarchical and scalable generative framework for swarm robots. We model the swarm's macroscopic state using Probability Density Functions (PDFs) and leverage conditional diffusion models to generate risk-aware macroscopic trajectory distributions, which then guide the generation of individual robot trajectories at the microscopic level. To ensure a balance between the swarm's optimal transportation and risk awareness, we integrate Wasserstein metrics and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). Additionally, we introduce a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to improve sampling efficiency and generation quality by capturing long-range dependencies. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that SwarmDiff outperforms existing methods in computational efficiency, trajectory validity, and scalability, making it a reliable solution for swarm robotic trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Trajectory-Based Bayesian Approach to Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization with Epoch-Aware Trade-Offs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15303v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training machine learning models inherently involves a resource-intensive and noisy iterative learning procedure that allows epoch-wise monitoring of the model performance. However, the insights gained from the iterative learning procedure typically remain underutilized in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization scenarios. Despite the limited research in this area, existing methods commonly identify the trade-offs only at the end of model training, overlooking the fact that trade-offs can emerge at earlier epochs in cases such as overfitting. To bridge this gap, we propose an enhanced multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problem that treats the number of training epochs as a decision variable, rather than merely an auxiliary parameter, to account for trade-offs at an earlier training stage. To solve this problem and accommodate its iterative learning, we then present a trajectory-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm characterized by two features: 1) a novel acquisition function that captures the improvement along the predictive trajectory of model performances over epochs for any hyperparameter setting and 2) a multi-objective early stopping mechanism that determines when to terminate the training to maximize epoch efficiency. Experiments on synthetic simulations and hyperparameter tuning benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively identify the desirable trade-offs while improving tuning efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Models as Reference Trajectories for Rapid Motor Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15589v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying learned control policies in real-world environments poses a fundamental challenge. When system dynamics change unexpectedly, performance degrades until models are retrained on new data. We introduce Reflexive World Models (RWM), a dual control framework that uses world model predictions as implicit reference trajectories for rapid adaptation. Our method separates the control problem into long-term reward maximization through reinforcement learning and robust motor execution through rapid latent control. This dual architecture achieves significantly faster adaptation with low online computational cost compared to model-based RL baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance. The approach combines the benefits of flexible policy learning through reinforcement learning with rapid error correction capabilities, providing a principled approach to maintaining performance in high-dimensional continuous control tasks under varying dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Bayes Analysis of Object Trajectory Representation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01696v5)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear trajectory models provide mathematical advantages to autonomous driving applications such as motion prediction. However, linear models' expressive power and bias for real-world trajectories have not been thoroughly analyzed. We present an in-depth empirical analysis of the trade-off between model complexity and fit error in modelling object trajectories. We analyze vehicle, cyclist, and pedestrian trajectories. Our methodology estimates observation noise and prior distributions over model parameters from several large-scale datasets. Incorporating these priors can then regularize prediction models. Our results show that linear models do represent real-world trajectories with high fidelity at very moderate model complexity. This suggests the feasibility of using linear trajectory models in future motion prediction systems with inherent mathematical advantages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revealing Language Model Trajectories via Kullback-Leibler Divergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15353v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recently proposed method enables efficient estimation of the KL divergence between language models, including models with different architectures, by assigning coordinates based on log-likelihood vectors. To better understand the behavior of this metric, we systematically evaluate KL divergence across a wide range of conditions using publicly available language models. Our analysis covers comparisons between pretraining checkpoints, fine-tuned and base models, and layers via the logit lens. We find that trajectories of language models, as measured by KL divergence, exhibit a spiral structure during pretraining and thread-like progressions across layers. Furthermore, we show that, in terms of diffusion exponents, model trajectories in the log-likelihood space are more constrained than those in weight space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization: A Simple Value-Based Method for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15311v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy-based methods currently dominate reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines for large language model (LLM) reasoning, leaving value-based approaches largely unexplored. We revisit the classical paradigm of Bellman Residual Minimization and introduce Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization (TBRM), an algorithm that naturally adapts this idea to LLMs, yielding a simple yet effective off-policy algorithm that optimizes a single trajectory-level Bellman objective using the model's own logits as $Q$-values. TBRM removes the need for critics, importance-sampling ratios, or clipping, and operates with only one rollout per prompt. We prove convergence to the near-optimal KL-regularized policy from arbitrary off-policy data via an improved change-of-trajectory-measure analysis. Experiments on standard mathematical-reasoning benchmarks show that TBRM consistently outperforms policy-based baselines, like PPO and GRPO, with comparable or lower computational and memory overhead. Our results indicate that value-based RL might be a principled and efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reachable Sets-based Trajectory Planning Combining Reinforcement Learning and iLQR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17398v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The driving risk field is applicable to more complex driving scenarios, providing new approaches for safety decision-making and active vehicle control in intricate environments. However, existing research often overlooks the driving risk field and fails to consider the impact of risk distribution within drivable areas on trajectory planning, which poses challenges for enhancing safety. This paper proposes a trajectory planning method for intelligent vehicles based on the risk reachable set to further improve the safety of trajectory planning. First, we construct the reachable set incorporating the driving risk field to more accurately assess and avoid potential risks in drivable areas. Then, the initial trajectory is generated based on safe reinforcement learning and projected onto the reachable set. Finally, we introduce a trajectory planning method based on a constrained iterative quadratic regulator to optimize the initial solution, ensuring that the planned trajectory achieves optimal comfort, safety, and efficiency. We conduct simulation tests of trajectory planning in high-speed lane-changing scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed method can guarantee trajectory comfort and driving efficiency, with the generated trajectory situated outside high-risk boundaries, thereby ensuring vehicle safety during operation.</p></details> | <details><summary>We si...</summary><p>We sincerely request the withdrawal of this paper.

While many studies address either full-body pose prediction or motion trajectory prediction, only a few attempt to merge them. We propose a motion transformation technique to simultaneously predict full-body pose and trajectory key-points in a global coordinate frame. We utilize an off-the-shelf 3D human pose estimation module, a graph attention network to encode the skeleton structure, and a compact, non-autoregressive transformer suitable for real-time motion prediction for human-robot interaction and human-aware navigation. We introduce a human navigation dataset ``DARKO'' with specific focus on navigational activities that are relevant for human-aware mobile robot navigation. We perform extensive evaluation on Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and our DARKO dataset. In comparison to prior work, we show that our approach is compact, real-time, and accurate in predicting human navigation motion across all datasets.

| **[Learning Spatio-Temporal Dynamics for Trajectory Recovery via Time-Aware Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13857v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications, GPS trajectories often suffer from low sampling rates, with large and irregular intervals between consecutive GPS points. This sparse characteristic presents challenges for their direct use in GPS-based systems. This paper addresses the task of map-constrained trajectory recovery, aiming to enhance trajectory sampling rates of GPS trajectories. Previous studies commonly adopt a sequence-to-sequence framework, where an encoder captures the trajectory patterns and a decoder reconstructs the target trajectory. Within this framework, effectively representing the road network and extracting relevant trajectory features are crucial for overall performance. Despite advancements in these models, they fail to fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal dynamics present in both the trajectory and the road network. To overcome these limitations, we categorize the spatio-temporal dynamics of trajectory data into two distinct aspects: spatial-temporal traffic dynamics and trajectory dynamics. Furthermore, We propose TedTrajRec, a novel method for trajectory recovery. To capture spatio-temporal traffic dynamics, we introduce PD-GNN, which models periodic patterns and learns topologically aware dynamics concurrently for each road segment. For spatio-temporal trajectory dynamics, we present TedFormer, a time-aware Transformer that incorporates temporal dynamics for each GPS location by integrating closed-form neural ordinary differential equations into the attention mechanism. This allows TedFormer to effectively handle irregularly sampled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TedTrajRec. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ysygMhdxw/TEDTrajRec/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a journal paper in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> |
| **[HyperNet Fields: Efficiently Training Hypernetworks without Ground Truth by Learning Weight Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17040v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To efficiently adapt large models or to train generative models of neural representations, Hypernetworks have drawn interest. While hypernetworks work well, training them is cumbersome, and often requires ground truth optimized weights for each sample. However, obtaining each of these weights is a training problem of its own-one needs to train, e.g., adaptation weights or even an entire neural field for hypernetworks to regress to. In this work, we propose a method to train hypernetworks, without the need for any per-sample ground truth. Our key idea is to learn a Hypernetwork `Field` and estimate the entire trajectory of network weight training instead of simply its converged state. In other words, we introduce an additional input to the Hypernetwork, the convergence state, which then makes it act as a neural field that models the entire convergence pathway of a task network. A critical benefit in doing so is that the gradient of the estimated weights at any convergence state must then match the gradients of the original task -- this constraint alone is sufficient to train the Hypernetwork Field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through the task of personalized image generation and 3D shape reconstruction from images and point clouds, demonstrating competitive results without any per-sample ground truth.</p></details> |  |

We first extract dense optical flow from a reference video, and utilize the resulting motion offsets to warp the complex-exponential tensors of RoPE, effectively encoding motion into the generation process. These embeddings are then further optimized during denoising time steps via trajectory alignment between the predicted and target velocities using a flow-matching objective. To keep the output faithful to the text prompt and prevent duplicate generations, we incorporate a regularization term based on the phase components of the reference video's Fourier transform, projecting the phase angles onto a smooth manifold to suppress high-frequency artifacts. Experiments on benchmarks reveal that RoPECraft outperforms all recently published methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://berkegokmen1.github.io/RoPECraft/</p></details> |

DreamGen leverages state-of-the-art image-to-video generative models, adapting them to the target robot embodiment to produce photorealistic synthetic videos of familiar or novel tasks in diverse environments. Since these models generate only videos, we recover pseudo-action sequences using either a latent action model or an inverse-dynamics model (IDM). Despite its simplicity, DreamGen unlocks strong behavior and environment generalization: a humanoid robot can perform 22 new behaviors in both seen and unseen environments, while requiring teleoperation data from only a single pick-and-place task in one environment. To evaluate the pipeline systematically, we introduce DreamGen Bench, a video generation benchmark that shows a strong correlation between benchmark performance and downstream policy success.

| **[TransferTraj: A Vehicle Trajectory Learning Model for Region and Task Transferability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12672v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle GPS trajectories provide valuable movement information that supports various downstream tasks and applications. A desirable trajectory learning model should be able to transfer across regions and tasks without retraining, avoiding the need to maintain multiple specialized models and subpar performance with limited training data. However, each region has its unique spatial features and contexts, which are reflected in vehicle movement patterns and difficult to generalize. Additionally, transferring across different tasks faces technical challenges due to the varying input-output structures required for each task. Existing efforts towards transferability primarily involve learning embedding vectors for trajectories, which perform poorly in region transfer and require retraining of prediction modules for task transfer. To address these challenges, we propose TransferTraj, a vehicle GPS trajectory learning model that excels in both region and task transferability. For region transferability, we introduce RTTE as the main learnable module within TransferTraj. It integrates spatial, temporal, POI, and road network modalities of trajectories to effectively manage variations in spatial context distribution across regions. It also introduces a TRIE module for incorporating relative information of spatial features and a spatial context MoE module for handling movement patterns in diverse contexts. For task transferability, we propose a task-transferable input-output scheme that unifies the input-output structure of different tasks into the masking and recovery of modalities and trajectory points. This approach allows TransferTraj to be pre-trained once and transferred to different tasks without retraining. Extensive experiments on three real-world vehicle trajectory datasets under task transfer, zero-shot, and few-shot region transfer, validating TransferTraj's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

The proposed planner integrates real-time trajectory optimization with adaptive gap analysis, enabling effective feasibility assessment under partial observability constraints. To address safety-critical computations in unknown scenarios, an enhanced online learning mechanism is introduced, which dynamically corrects spatial trajectories by forming dynamic safety margins while maintaining control invariance. Extensive evaluations, including ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrate superior success rates and computational efficiency.

| **[Revisiting Synthetic Human Trajectories: Imitative Generation and Benchmarks Beyond Datasaurus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13790v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory data, which plays a crucial role in various applications such as crowd management and epidemic prevention, is challenging to obtain due to practical constraints and privacy concerns. In this context, synthetic human trajectory data is generated to simulate as close as possible to real-world human trajectories, often under summary statistics and distributional similarities. However, these similarities oversimplify complex human mobility patterns (a.k.a. ``Datasaurus''), resulting in intrinsic biases in both generative model design and benchmarks of the generated trajectories. Against this background, we propose MIRAGE, a huMan-Imitative tRAjectory GenErative model designed as a neural Temporal Point Process integrating an Exploration and Preferential Return model. It imitates the human decision-making process in trajectory generation, rather than fitting any specific statistical distributions as traditional methods do, thus avoiding the Datasaurus issue. We also propose a comprehensive task-based evaluation protocol beyond Datasaurus to systematically benchmark trajectory generative models on four typical downstream tasks, integrating multiple techniques and evaluation metrics for each task, to assess the ultimate utility of the generated trajectories. We conduct a thorough evaluation of MIRAGE on three real-world user trajectory datasets against a sizeable collection of baselines. Results show that compared to the best baselines, MIRAGE-generated trajectory data not only achieves the best statistical and distributional similarities with 59.0-67.7% improvement, but also yields the best performance in the task-based evaluation with 10.9-33.4% improvement. A series of ablation studies also validate the key design choices of MIRAGE.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD'25 |

However, progress in this field is hindered by two key challenges: the over-reliance on older datasets from 2012-2013 and the lack of reproducible, city-level check-in datasets that reflect diverse global regions. To address these gaps, we present Massive-STEPS (Massive Semantic Trajectories for Understanding POI Check-ins), a large-scale, publicly available benchmark dataset built upon the Semantic Trails dataset and enriched with semantic POI metadata. Massive-STEPS spans 12 geographically and culturally diverse cities and features more recent (2017-2018) and longer-duration (24 months) check-in data than prior datasets. We benchmarked a wide range of POI recommendation models on Massive-STEPS using both supervised and zero-shot approaches, and evaluated their performance across multiple urban contexts. By releasing Massive-STEPS, we aim to facilitate reproducible and equitable research in human mobility and POI recommendation.

Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions. Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories. We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 30 figures, Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Timely Trajectory Reconstruction in Finite Buffer Remote Tracking Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00849v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote tracking systems play a critical role in applications such as IoT, monitoring, surveillance and healthcare. In such systems, maintaining both real-time state awareness (for online decision making) and accurate reconstruction of historical trajectories (for offline post-processing) are essential. While the Age of Information (AoI) metric has been extensively studied as a measure of freshness, it does not capture the accuracy with which past trajectories can be reconstructed. In this work, we investigate reconstruction error as a complementary metric to AoI, addressing the trade-off between timely updates and historical accuracy. Specifically, we consider three policies, each prioritizing different aspects of information management: Keep-Old, Keep-Fresh, and our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy. We compare these policies in terms of impact on both AoI and reconstruction error in a remote tracking system with a finite buffer. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of queueing behavior, we demonstrate that while the Keep-Fresh policy minimizes AoI, it does not necessarily minimize reconstruction error. In contrast, our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy dynamically adjusts packet retention decisions based on generation times, achieving a balance between AoI and reconstruction error. Our results provide key insights into the design of efficient buffer management policies for resource-constrained IoT networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Interplanetary Trajectories using Hybrid Meta-heuristic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12399v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes an advanced hybrid optimization (GMPA) algorithm to effectively address the inherent limitations of the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) when applied to complex optimization scenarios. Specifically, GMPA integrates essential features from the Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) into the GWO framework, enabling superior performance through enhanced exploration and exploitation balance. The evaluation utilizes the GTOPX benchmark dataset from the European Space Agency (ESA), encompassing highly complex interplanetary trajectory optimization problems characterized by pronounced nonlinearity and multiple conflicting objectives reflective of real-world aerospace scenarios. Central to GMPA's methodology is an elite matrix, borrowed from MPA, designed to preserve and refine high-quality solutions iteratively, thereby promoting solution diversity and minimizing premature convergence. Furthermore, GMPA incorporates a three-phase position updating mechanism combined with L\'evy flights and Brownian motion to significantly bolster exploration capabilities, effectively mitigating the risk of stagnation in local optima. GMPA dynamically retains historical information on promising search areas, leveraging the memory storage features intrinsic to MPA, facilitating targeted exploitation and refinement. Empirical evaluations demonstrate GMPA's superior effectiveness compared to traditional GWO and other advanced metaheuristic algorithms, achieving markedly improved convergence rates and solution quality across GTOPX benchmarks. Consequently, GMPA emerges as a robust, efficient, and adaptive optimization approach particularly suitable for high-dimensional and complex aerospace trajectory optimization, offering significant insights and practical advancements in hybrid metaheuristic optimization techniques.</p></details> |  |

However, there remains a notable gap in comprehensive accessibility metrics that integrate the mobility of the users. This study introduces a novel accessibility metric, termed Trajectory-Integrated Public EVCS Accessibility (TI-acs), and uses it to assess public electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) accessibility for approximately 6 million residents in the San Francisco Bay Area based on detailed individual trajectory data in one week. Unlike conventional home-based metrics, TI-acs incorporates the accessibility of EVCS along individuals' travel trajectories, bringing insights on more public charging contexts, including public charging near workplaces and charging during grid off-peak periods. As of June 2024, given the current public EVCS network, Bay Area residents have, on average, 7.5 hours and 5.2 hours of access per day during which their stay locations are within 1 km (i.e. 10-12 min walking) of a public L2 and DCFC charging port, respectively. Over the past decade, TI-acs has steadily increased from the rapid expansion of the EV market and charging infrastructure. However, spatial disparities remain significant, as reflected in Gini indices of 0.38 (L2) and 0.44 (DCFC) across census tracts. Additionally, our analysis reveals racial disparities in TI-acs, driven not only by variations in charging infrastructure near residential areas but also by differences in their mobility patterns.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |

Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. In this paper, we introduce an Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2X) collaborative prediction scheme. In this scheme, roadside units (RSUs) independently forecast the future trajectories of all vehicles and transmit these predictions unidirectionally to subscribing vehicles. Building on this scheme, we propose I2XTraj, a dedicated infrastructure-based trajectory prediction model. I2XTraj leverages real-time traffic signal states, prior maneuver strategy knowledge, and multi-agent interactions to generate accurate, joint multi-modal trajectory prediction. First, a continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals to guide trajectory proposal generation under varied intersection configurations. Second, a driving strategy awareness mechanism estimates the joint distribution of maneuver strategies by integrating spatial priors of intersection areas with dynamic vehicle states, enabling coverage of the full set of feasible maneuvers. Third, a spatial-temporal-mode attention network models multi-agent interactions to refine and adjust joint trajectory outputs.Finally, I2XTraj is evaluated on two real-world datasets of signalized intersections, the V2X-Seq and the SinD drone dataset. In both single-infrastructure and online collaborative scenarios, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 30\% on V2X-Seq and 15\% on SinD, demonstrating strong generalizability and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Employing Laban Shape for Generating Emotionally and Functionally Expressive Trajectories in Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11716v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Successful human-robot collaboration depends on cohesive communication and a precise understanding of the robot's abilities, goals, and constraints. While robotic manipulators offer high precision, versatility, and productivity, they exhibit expressionless and monotonous motions that conceal the robot's intention, resulting in a lack of efficiency and transparency with humans. In this work, we use Laban notation, a dance annotation language, to enable robotic manipulators to generate trajectories with functional expressivity, where the robot uses nonverbal cues to communicate its abilities and the likelihood of succeeding at its task. We achieve this by introducing two novel variants of Hesitant expressive motion (Spoke-Like and Arc-Like). We also enhance the emotional expressivity of four existing emotive trajectories (Happy, Sad, Shy, and Angry) by augmenting Laban Effort usage with Laban Shape. The functionally expressive motions are validated via a human-subjects study, where participants equate both variants of Hesitant motion with reduced robot competency. The enhanced emotive trajectories are shown to be viewed as distinct emotions using the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) spectrum, corroborating the usage of Laban Shape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for the 2025 IEEE RO-MAN Conference</p></details> |

The algorithm estimates Markov parameters from a single trajectory and applies a variant of the Ho-Kalman algorithm to recover the system matrices. Our bound guarantees statistical consistency under the assumption that the true system exhibits quadratic stability. The proof leverages the theory of weakly dependent processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first finite-sample bound for this algorithm in the single-trajectory setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active RLHF via Best Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18873v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of best policy identification in preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), where learning occurs from noisy binary preferences over trajectory pairs rather than explicit numerical rewards. This approach is useful for post-training optimization of generative AI models during multi-turn user interactions, where preference feedback is more robust than handcrafted reward models. In this setting, learning is driven by both an offline preference dataset -- collected from a rater of unknown `competence' -- and online data collected with pure exploration. Since offline datasets may exhibit out-of-distribution (OOD) biases, principled online data collection is necessary. To address this, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling, that maintains independent posteriors over the true reward model and transition dynamics. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for PbRL in this setting, establishing an upper bound on the simple Bayesian regret of $\mathsf{PSPL}$. Since the exact algorithm can be computationally impractical, we also provide an approximate version that outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

| **[Improving Trajectory Stitching with Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07802v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have shown great promise as trajectory planners, given their affinity to modeling complex distributions and guidable inference process. Previous works have successfully applied these in the context of robotic manipulation but perform poorly when the required solution does not exist as a complete trajectory within the training set. We identify that this is a result of being unable to plan via stitching, and subsequently address the architectural and dataset choices needed to remedy this. On top of this, we propose a novel addition to the training and inference procedures to both stabilize and enhance these capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating plans with out of distribution boundary conditions and performing obstacle avoidance on the Franka Panda in simulation and on real hardware. In both of these tasks our method performs significantly better than the baselines and is able to avoid obstacles up to four times as large.</p></details> |  |
| **[TO-GATE: Clarifying Questions and Summarizing Responses with Trajectory Optimization for Eliciting Human Preference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02827v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can effectively elicit human preferences through multi-turn dialogue. Complex tasks can be accomplished through iterative clarifying questions and final responses generated by an LLM acting as a questioner (STaR-GATE; Andukuri et al., 2024}). However, existing approaches based on self-taught reasoning struggle to identify optimal dialogue trajectories and avoid irrelevant questions to the tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TO-GATE, a novel framework that enhances question generation through trajectory optimization, which consists of two key components: a clarification resolver that generates optimal questioning trajectories, and a summarizer that ensures task-aligned final responses. The trajectory optimization enables the model to produce effective elicitation questions and summary responses tailored to specific tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TO-GATE significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving a 9.32% improvement on standard preference elicitation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Sequence Editing for Biological and Clinical Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03569v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional generation models for longitudinal sequences can generate new or modified trajectories given a conditioning input. While effective at generating entire sequences, these models typically lack control over the timing and scope of the edits. Most existing approaches either operate on univariate sequences or assume that the condition affects all variables and time steps. However, many scientific and clinical applications require more precise interventions, where a condition takes effect only after a specific time and influences only a subset of variables. We introduce CLEF, a controllable sequence editing model for conditional generation of immediate and delayed effects in multivariate longitudinal sequences. CLEF learns temporal concepts that encode how and when a condition alters future sequence evolution. These concepts allow CLEF to apply targeted edits to the affected time steps and variables while preserving the rest of the sequence. We evaluate CLEF on 6 datasets spanning cellular reprogramming and patient health trajectories, comparing against 9 state-of-the-art baselines. CLEF improves immediate sequence editing accuracy by up to 36.01% (MAE). Unlike prior models, CLEF enables one-step conditional generation at arbitrary future times, outperforming them in delayed sequence editing by up to 65.71% (MAE). We test CLEF under counterfactual inference assumptions and show up to 63.19% (MAE) improvement on zero-shot conditional generation of counterfactual trajectories. In a case study of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, CLEF identifies clinical interventions that generate realistic counterfactual trajectories shifted toward healthier outcomes.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method, Exploration-Boosted MC-PILCO (EB-MC-PILCO), leverages iLQR to generate informative, exploratory trajectories and initialize the policy, significantly reducing the number of required optimization steps. Experiments on the cart-pole task demonstrate that EB-MC-PILCO accelerates convergence compared to standard MC-PILCO, achieving up to $\bm{45.9\%}$ reduction in execution time when both methods solve the task in four trials. EB-MC-PILCO also maintains a $\bm{100\%}$ success rate across trials while solving the task faster, even in cases where MC-PILCO converges in fewer iterations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrast & Compress: Learning Lightweight Embeddings for Short Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02571v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to retrieve semantically and directionally similar short-range trajectories with both accuracy and efficiency is foundational for downstream applications such as motion forecasting and autonomous navigation. However, prevailing approaches often depend on computationally intensive heuristics or latent anchor representations that lack interpretability and controllability. In this work, we propose a novel framework for learning fixed-dimensional embeddings for short trajectories by leveraging a Transformer encoder trained with a contrastive triplet loss that emphasize the importance of discriminative feature spaces for trajectory data. We analyze the influence of Cosine and FFT-based similarity metrics within the contrastive learning paradigm, with a focus on capturing the nuanced directional intent that characterizes short-term maneuvers. Our empirical evaluation on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates that embeddings shaped by Cosine similarity objectives yield superior clustering of trajectories by both semantic and directional attributes, outperforming FFT-based baselines in retrieval tasks. Notably, we show that compact Transformer architectures, even with low-dimensional embeddings (e.g., 16 dimensions, but qualitatively down to 4), achieve a compelling balance between retrieval performance (minADE, minFDE) and computational overhead, aligning with the growing demand for scalable and interpretable motion priors in real-time systems. The resulting embeddings provide a compact, semantically meaningful, and efficient representation of trajectory data, offering a robust alternative to heuristic similarity measures and paving the way for more transparent and controllable motion forecasting pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for peer review</p></details> |
| **[3D Trajectory Reconstruction of Moving Points Based on Asynchronous Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00541v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photomechanics is a crucial branch of solid mechanics. The localization of point targets constitutes a fundamental problem in optical experimental mechanics, with extensive applications in various missions of UAVs. Localizing moving targets is crucial for analyzing their motion characteristics and dynamic properties. Reconstructing the trajectories of points from asynchronous cameras is a significant challenge. It encompasses two coupled sub-problems: trajectory reconstruction and camera synchronization. Present methods typically address only one of these sub-problems individually. This paper proposes a 3D trajectory reconstruction method for point targets based on asynchronous cameras, simultaneously solving both sub-problems. Firstly, we extend the trajectory intersection method to asynchronous cameras to resolve the limitation of traditional triangulation that requires camera synchronization. Secondly, we develop models for camera temporal information and target motion, based on imaging mechanisms and target dynamics characteristics. The parameters are optimized simultaneously to achieve trajectory reconstruction without accurate time parameters. Thirdly, we optimize the camera rotations alongside the camera time information and target motion parameters, using tighter and more continuous constraints on moving points. The reconstruction accuracy is significantly improved, especially when the camera rotations are inaccurate. Finally, the simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. The real-world results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieved a localization error of 112.95 m at an observation range of 15 ~ 20 km.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Acta Mechanica Sinica</p></details> |

To address these issues, we present LAM SIMULATOR, a comprehensive framework designed for online exploration of agentic tasks with high-quality feedback. Our framework features a dynamic task query generator, an extensive collection of tools, and an interactive environment where Large Language Model (LLM) Agents can call tools and receive real-time feedback. This setup enables LLM Agents to explore and solve tasks autonomously, facilitating the discovery of multiple approaches to tackle any given task. The resulting action trajectory data are then used to create high-quality training datasets for LAMs. Our experiments on popular agentic benchmarks, ToolBench and CRMArena, highlight the effectiveness of LAM SIMULATOR: models trained with self-generated datasets using our framework achieve significant performance gains, up to a 49.3\% improvement over their original baselines.

However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fuxiao0719.github.io/projects/robomaster/ Code: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/RoboMaster</p></details> |
| **[Online Competitive Information Gathering for Partially Observable Trajectory Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01927v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Game-theoretic agents must make plans that optimally gather information about their opponents. These problems are modeled by partially observable stochastic games (POSGs), but planning in fully continuous POSGs is intractable without heavy offline computation or assumptions on the order of belief maintained by each player. We formulate a finite history/horizon refinement of POSGs which admits competitive information gathering behavior in trajectory space, and through a series of approximations, we present an online method for computing rational trajectory plans in these games which leverages particle-based estimations of the joint state space and performs stochastic gradient play. We also provide the necessary adjustments required to deploy this method on individual agents. The method is tested in continuous pursuit-evasion and warehouse-pickup scenarios (alongside extensions to $N > 2$ players and to more complex environments with visual and physical obstacles), demonstrating evidence of active information gathering and outperforming passive competitors.</p></details> | Accepted at RSS 2025 |

This arises because users frequently do not fully understand their own needs, while systems require precise intent definitions. Current LLM-based agents cannot effectively distinguish between linguistically complete and contextually triggerable expressions, lacking frameworks for collaborative intent formation. We present STORM, a framework modeling asymmetric information dynamics through conversations between UserLLM (full internal access) and AgentLLM (observable behavior only). STORM produces annotated corpora capturing expression trajectories and latent cognitive transitions, enabling systematic analysis of collaborative understanding development. Our contributions include: (1) formalizing asymmetric information processing in dialogue systems; (2) modeling intent formation tracking collaborative understanding evolution; and (3) evaluation metrics measuring internal cognitive improvements alongside task performance. Experiments across four language models reveal that moderate uncertainty (40-60%) can outperform complete transparency in certain scenarios, with model-specific patterns suggesting reconsideration of optimal information completeness in human-AI collaboration. These findings contribute to understanding asymmetric reasoning dynamics and inform uncertainty-calibrated dialogue system design.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 31 figures.

| **[Trajectory First: A Curriculum for Discovering Diverse Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01568v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Being able to solve a task in diverse ways makes agents more robust to task variations and less prone to local optima. In this context, constrained diversity optimization has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning (RL) framework to train a diverse set of agents in parallel. However, existing constrained-diversity RL methods often under-explore in complex tasks such as robotic manipulation, leading to a lack in policy diversity. To improve diversity optimization in RL, we therefore propose a curriculum that first explores at the trajectory level before learning step-based policies. In our empirical evaluation, we provide novel insights into the shortcoming of skill-based diversity optimization, and demonstrate empirically that our curriculum improves the diversity of the learned skills.</p></details> |  |

Despite its growing prominence, the field lacks a systematic and unified survey that consolidates essential knowledge and advancements in this domain. This paper addresses this gap by providing the first comprehensive review of the field, covering from foundational definitions to advanced methodologies. We introduce the different approaches to camera representation and present an in-depth review of available camera trajectory generation models, starting with rule-based approaches and progressing through optimization-based techniques, machine learning advancements, and hybrid methods that integrate multiple strategies. Additionally, we gather and analyze the metrics and datasets commonly used for evaluating camera trajectory systems, offering insights into how these tools measure performance, aesthetic quality, and practical applicability. Finally, we highlight existing limitations, critical gaps in current research, and promising opportunities for investment and innovation in the field. This paper not only serves as a foundational resource for researchers entering the field but also paves the way for advancing adaptive, efficient, and creative camera trajectory systems across diverse applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[State-Covering Trajectory Stitching for Diffusion Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00895v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models are emerging as powerful tools for long-horizon planning in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with offline datasets. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Predicting Any Human Trajectory In Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00871v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for adaptability in different environments and domains. A common approach involves collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via backpropagation. However, this process is often impractical on edge devices due to constrained computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enables rapid adaptation without fine-tuning on the scenario-specific data. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public benchmarks. The code will be released at https://fujiry0.github.io/TrajICL-project-page.</p></details> |  |

This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/KG-TRACES.</p></details> | 23 pages, 13 figures |

As time progresses, the amount of data fitted by the AD model expands, which helps to improve the AD model generalization substantially. However, such ever-expanding data is a double-edged sword for the AD model. Specifically, as the fitted data volume grows to exceed the the AD model's fitting capacities, the AD model is prone to under-fitting. To address this issue, we propose to use a pretrained Large Vision Models (LVMs) as backbone coupled with downstream perception head to understand AD semantic information. This design can not only surmount the aforementioned under-fitting problem due to LVMs' powerful fitting capabilities, but also enhance the perception generalization thanks to LVMs' vast and diverse training data. On the other hand, to mitigate vehicles' computational burden of training the perception head while running LVM backbone, we introduce a Posterior Optimization Trajectory (POT)-Guided optimization scheme (POTGui) to accelerate the convergence. Concretely, we propose a POT Generator (POTGen) to generate posterior (future) optimization direction in advance to guide the current optimization iteration, through which the model can generally converge within 10 epochs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance by over 66.48\% and converges faster over 6 times, compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Rule-based planners are efficient but lack generalization, while learning-based planners excel in generalization yet have limitations in real-time performance and interpretability. In long-tail scenarios, these challenges make planning particularly difficult. To leverage the strengths of both rule-based and learning-based planners, we proposed the Scenario-Aware Hybrid Planner (SAH-Drive) for closed-loop vehicle trajectory planning. Inspired by human driving behavior, SAH-Drive combines a lightweight rule-based planner and a comprehensive learning-based planner, utilizing a dual-timescale decision neuron to determine the final trajectory. To enhance the computational efficiency and robustness of the hybrid planner, we also employed a diffusion proposal number regulator and a trajectory fusion module. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the generalization capability of the planning system, achieving state-of-the-art performance in interPlan, while maintaining computational efficiency without incurring substantial additional runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, International Conference on Machine Learning</p></details> |

While open-source LMM agents have made significant advances in offline evaluation benchmarks, their performance still falls substantially short of human-level capabilities in more realistic online settings. A key bottleneck is the lack of diverse and large-scale trajectory-level datasets across various domains, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a scalable recipe to synthesize the largest and most diverse trajectory-level dataset to date, containing over 94K successful multimodal web trajectories, spanning 49K unique URLs, 720K screenshots, and 33M web elements. In particular, we leverage extensive web exploration and refinement to obtain diverse task intents. The average cost is 28 cents per successful trajectory, making it affordable to a wide range of users in the community. Leveraging this dataset, we train Explorer, a multimodal web agent, and demonstrate strong performance on both offline and online web agent benchmarks such as Mind2Web-Live, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and MiniWob++. Additionally, our experiments highlight data scaling as a key driver for improving web agent capabilities.

Modeling hand-object interaction priors holds significant potential to advance robotic and embodied AI systems in learning to operate effectively within the physical world. We introduce SIGHT, a novel task focused on generating realistic and physically plausible 3D hand-object interaction trajectories from a single image and a brief language-based task description. Prior work on hand-object trajectory generation typically relies on textual input that lacks explicit grounding to the target object, or assumes access to 3D object meshes, which are often considerably more difficult to obtain than 2D images. We propose SIGHT-Fusion, a novel diffusion-based image-text conditioned generative model that tackles this task by retrieving the most similar 3D object mesh from a database and enforcing geometric hand-object interaction constraints via a novel inference-time diffusion guidance. We benchmark our model on the HOI4D and H2O datasets, adapting relevant baselines for this novel task. Experiments demonstrate our superior performance in the diversity and quality of generated trajectories, as well as in hand-object interaction geometry metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Trajectory, One Token: Grounded Video Tokenization via Panoptic Sub-object Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23617v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective video tokenization is critical for scaling transformer models for long videos. Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches, leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles, ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with 10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2% performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks, making it a robust and scalable solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive Meta-Actions for Unified Controllable Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23612v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable trajectory generation guided by high-level semantic decisions, termed meta-actions, is crucial for autonomous driving systems. A significant limitation of existing frameworks is their reliance on invariant meta-actions assigned over fixed future time intervals, causing temporal misalignment with the actual behavior trajectories. This misalignment leads to irrelevant associations between the prescribed meta-actions and the resulting trajectories, disrupting task coherence and limiting model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Autoregressive Meta-Actions, an approach integrated into autoregressive trajectory generation frameworks that provides a unified and precise definition for meta-action-conditioned trajectory prediction. Specifically, We decompose traditional long-interval meta-actions into frame-level meta-actions, enabling a sequential interplay between autoregressive meta-action prediction and meta-action-conditioned trajectory generation. This decomposition ensures strict alignment between each trajectory segment and its corresponding meta-action, achieving a consistent and unified task formulation across the entire trajectory span and significantly reducing complexity. Moreover, we propose a staged pre-training process to decouple the learning of basic motion dynamics from the integration of high-level decision control, which offers flexibility, stability, and modularity. Experimental results validate our framework's effectiveness, demonstrating improved trajectory adaptivity and responsiveness to dynamic decision-making scenarios. We provide the video document and dataset, which are available at https://arma-traj.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations or preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle to address long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. We finally leverage these calibrated trajectories with successful trajectories for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that timely calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness.

We propose a centroidal online trajectory generation and stabilization control for humanoid dynamic multi-contact motion. The proposed method features the drastic reduction of the computational cost by using preview control instead of the conventional model predictive control that considers the constraints of all sample times. By combining preview control with centroidal state feedback for robustness to disturbances and wrench distribution for satisfying contact constraints, we show that the robot can stably perform a variety of multi-contact motions through simulation experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRACE: Trajectory-Constrained Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23312v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have shown unprecedented generative capability, but their ability to produce undesirable concepts (e.g.~pornographic content, sensitive identities, copyrighted styles) poses serious concerns for privacy, fairness, and safety. {Concept erasure} aims to remove or suppress specific concept information in a generative model. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TRACE (Trajectory-Constrained Attentional Concept Erasure)}, a novel method to erase targeted concepts from diffusion models while preserving overall generative quality. Our approach combines a rigorous theoretical framework, establishing formal conditions under which a concept can be provably suppressed in the diffusion process, with an effective fine-tuning procedure compatible with both conventional latent diffusion (Stable Diffusion) and emerging rectified flow models (e.g.~FLUX). We first derive a closed-form update to the model's cross-attention layers that removes hidden representations of the target concept. We then introduce a trajectory-aware finetuning objective that steers the denoising process away from the concept only in the late sampling stages, thus maintaining the model's fidelity on unrelated content. Empirically, we evaluate TRACE on multiple benchmarks used in prior concept erasure studies (object classes, celebrity faces, artistic styles, and explicit content from the I2P dataset). TRACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent methods such as ANT, EraseAnything, and MACE in terms of removal efficacy and output quality.</p></details> | In peer review |
| **[Universal Trajectory Optimization Framework for Differential Drive Robot Class](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07924v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential drive robots are widely used in various scenarios thanks to their straightforward principle, from household service robots to disaster response field robots. There are several types of driving mechanisms for real-world applications, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled skid-steering, tracked robots, and so on. The differences in the driving mechanisms usually require specific kinematic modeling when precise control is desired. Furthermore, the nonholonomic dynamics and possible lateral slip lead to different degrees of difficulty in getting feasible and high-quality trajectories. Therefore, a comprehensive trajectory optimization framework to compute trajectories efficiently for various kinds of differential drive robots is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a universal trajectory optimization framework that can be applied to differential drive robots, enabling the generation of high-quality trajectories within a restricted computational timeframe. We introduce a novel trajectory representation based on polynomial parameterization of motion states or their integrals, such as angular and linear velocities, which inherently matches the robots' motion to the control principle. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize complexity while prioritizing safety and operational efficiency. We then build a full-stack autonomous planning and control system to demonstrate its feasibility and robustness. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world testing in crowded environments with three kinds of differential drive robots to validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |

In this paper, we leverage ideas from generative modeling of image data to push the boundary of time series generation. For this, we find new generators of SDEs and jump processes, inspired by trajectory flow matching, that have the marginal distributions of the time series of interest. Specifically, we can handle discontinuities of the underlying processes by parameterizing the jump kernel densities by scaled Gaussians that allow for closed form formulas of the corresponding Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss. Unlike most other approaches, we are able to handle irregularly sampled time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowAlign: Trajectory-Regularized, Inversion-Free Flow-based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23145v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3, enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProDiff: Prototype-Guided Diffusion for Minimal Information Trajectory Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23048v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data is crucial for various applications but often suffers from incompleteness due to device limitations and diverse collection scenarios. Existing imputation methods rely on sparse trajectory or travel information, such as velocity, to infer missing points. However, these approaches assume that sparse trajectories retain essential behavioral patterns, which place significant demands on data acquisition and overlook the potential of large-scale human trajectory embeddings. To address this, we propose ProDiff, a trajectory imputation framework that uses only two endpoints as minimal information. It integrates prototype learning to embed human movement patterns and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model for robust spatiotemporal reconstruction. Joint training with a tailored loss function ensures effective imputation. ProDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving accuracy by 6.28\% on FourSquare and 2.52\% on WuXi. Further analysis shows a 0.927 correlation between generated and real trajectories, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATI: Any Trajectory Instruction for Controllable Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22944v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a unified framework for motion control in video generation that seamlessly integrates camera movement, object-level translation, and fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. In contrast to prior methods that address these motion types through separate modules or task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones.

| **[Fast Trajectory-Independent Model-Based Reconstruction Algorithm for Multi-Dimensional Magnetic Particle Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22797v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a promising tomographic technique for visualizing the spatio-temporal distribution of superparamagnetic nanoparticles, with applications ranging from cancer detection to real-time cardiovascular monitoring. Traditional MPI reconstruction relies on either time-consuming calibration (measured system matrix) or model-based simulation of the forward operator. Recent developments have shown the applicability of Chebyshev polynomials to multi-dimensional Lissajous Field-Free Point (FFP) scans. This method is bound to the particular choice of sinusoidal scanning trajectories. In this paper, we present the first reconstruction on real 2D MPI data with a trajectory-independent model-based MPI reconstruction algorithm. We further develop the zero-shot Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithm of the authors -- with automatic noise level estimation -- to address the present deconvolution problem, leveraging a state-of-the-art denoiser trained on natural images without retraining on MPI-specific data. We evaluate our method on the publicly available 2D FFP MPI dataset ``MPIdata: Equilibrium Model with Anisotropy", featuring scans of six phantoms acquired using a Bruker preclinical scanner. Moreover, we show reconstruction performed on custom data on a 2D scanner with additional high-frequency excitation field and partial data. Our results demonstrate strong reconstruction capabilities across different scanning scenarios -- setting a precedent for general-purpose, flexible model-based MPI reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Nonlinear second-order dynamics describe labial constriction trajectories across languages and contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08351v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the dynamics of labial constriction trajectories during the production of /b/ and /m/ in English and Mandarin. We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach remains primarily acoustic and lacks articulatory constraints. In this study, the same 75 VCVs are analyzed, but generated with the Maeda model, using trajectory planning that differentiates vowel-to-vowel transitions from consonantal influences. Synthetic data exhibit similar characteristics to Ohman's sequences, including the presence of S-shaped F2 trajectories. Furthermore, locus equations (LEs) for F2 and F3 are computed from synthetic CV data to investigate their underlying determinism, leading to a reassessment of conventional interpretations. The findings indicate that, although articulatory planning is structured separately for vowel and consonant groups, S-shaped F2 trajectories emerge from a composite mechanism governed by the coordinated synergy of all articulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

This study categorizes such misalignments into three types: (1) lack of functions to express intent, (2) inefficient action sequences, and (3) incorrect intentions that cannot solve the task. To address these issues, we first formalize and define these three misalignment types in a unified framework. We then propose a heuristic algorithm to detect misalignments in ARCTraj trajectories and analyze their impact hierarchically and quantitatively. We also present an intention estimation method based on our formalism that infers missing alignment between user actions and intentions. Through trajectory alignment, we experimentally demonstrate that AI models trained on human task-solving trajectories improve performance in mimicking human reasoning. Based on hierarchical analysis and experiments, we highlight the importance of trajectory-intention alignment and demonstrate the effectiveness of intention-aligned training.</p></details> | KDD 2025 accepted |
| **[Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction in the Crash Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16349v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction methods have been widely applied in autonomous driving technologies. Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoMaPOI: A Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Next POI Prediction Bridging the Gap Between Trajectory and Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23837v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for the next Point-Of-Interest (POI) prediction task, leveraging their capabilities in semantic understanding of POI trajectories. However, previous LLM-based methods, which are superficially adapted to next POI prediction, largely overlook critical challenges associated with applying LLMs to this task. Specifically, LLMs encounter two critical challenges: (1) a lack of intrinsic understanding of numeric spatiotemporal data, which hinders accurate modeling of users' spatiotemporal distributions and preferences; and (2) an excessively large and unconstrained candidate POI space, which often results in random or irrelevant predictions. To address these issues, we propose a Collaborative Multi Agent Framework for Next POI Prediction, named CoMaPOI. Through the close interaction of three specialized agents (Profiler, Forecaster, and Predictor), CoMaPOI collaboratively addresses the two critical challenges. The Profiler agent is responsible for converting numeric data into language descriptions, enhancing semantic understanding. The Forecaster agent focuses on dynamically constraining and refining the candidate POI space. The Predictor agent integrates this information to generate high-precision predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (NYC, TKY, and CA) demonstrate that CoMaPOI achieves state of the art performance, improving all metrics by 5% to 10% compared to SOTA baselines. This work pioneers the investigation of challenges associated with applying LLMs to complex spatiotemporal tasks by leveraging tailored collaborative agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

By employing quantum concepts and a quantum search algorithm, this work presents the implementation and optimization of the agent-environment interactions entirely within the quantum domain, eliminating reliance on classical computations. Key contributions include the quantum-based state transitions, return calculation, and trajectory search mechanism that utilize quantum principles to demonstrate the realization of RL processes through quantum phenomena. The implementation emphasizes the fundamental role of quantum superposition in enhancing computational efficiency for RL tasks. Results demonstrate the capacity of a quantum model to achieve quantum enhancement in RL, highlighting the potential of fully quantum implementations in decision-making tasks. This work not only underscores the applicability of quantum computing in machine learning but also contributes to the field of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) by offering a robust framework for understanding and exploiting quantum computing in RL systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Weight Diffusion: Generating reactive policies instead of trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14040v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has emerged as a viable approach for both robot manipulation and locomotion. Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost, namely, larger model size and slower inference. This is especially an issue for robotic tasks that require high control frequency. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (DP), a popular model for generating trajectories: fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. For these reasons, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to generate closed-loop policies (weights for neural policies) for robotic tasks, rather than generating trajectories. Learning the behavior distribution through parameter space over trajectory space offers two key advantages: longer action horizons (fewer diffusion queries) & robustness to perturbations while retaining high performance; and a lower inference compute cost. To this end, we show that LWD has higher success rates than DP when the action horizon is longer and when stochastic perturbations exist in the environment. Furthermore, LWD achieves multitask performance comparable to DP while requiring just ~1/45th of the inference-time FLOPS</p></details> |  |
| **[Streaming Flow Policy: Simplifying diffusion$/$flow-matching policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21851v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion$/$flow-matching policies have enabled imitation learning of complex, multi-modal action trajectories. However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.

However, existing learning-based planning methods often rely on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting unsafe behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a novel two-stage trajectory planning framework that formulates trajectory planning as a sequential prediction task, guided by explicit planning principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. In the first stage, we train an autoregressive trajectory predictor via next motion token prediction on expert data. In the second stage, we design rule-based rewards (e.g., collision avoidance, speed limits) and fine-tune the model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning strategy, to align its predictions with these planning principles. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that our Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be made public soon.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose IKMo, an image-keyframed motion generation method based on the diffusion model with trajectory and pose being decoupled. The trajectory and pose inputs go through a two-stage conditioning framework. In the first stage, the dedicated optimization module is applied to refine inputs. In the second stage, trajectory and pose are encoded via a Trajectory Encoder and a Pose Encoder in parallel. Then, motion with high spatial and semantic fidelity is guided by a motion ControlNet, which processes the fused trajectory and pose data. Experiment results based on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art on all metrics under trajectory-keyframe constraints. In addition, MLLM-based agents are implemented to pre-process model inputs. Given texts and keyframe images from users, the agents extract motion descriptions, keyframe poses, and trajectories as the optimized inputs into the motion generation model. We conducts a user study with 10 participants. The experiment results prove that the MLLM-based agents pre-processing makes generated motion more in line with users' expectation. We believe that the proposed method improves both the fidelity and controllability of motion generation by the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |

However, as nearly passive reflective metasurfaces, RISs may not distinguish between desired and interference signals, which can lead to severe spectrum pollution and even affect performance negatively. In particular, in large-scale networks, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiving node can be degraded due to excessive interference reflected from the RIS. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose in this paper a trajectory prediction-based dynamical control algorithm (TPC) for anticipating RIS ON-OFF states sequence, integrating a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) scheme to predict user trajectories. In particular, through a codebook-based algorithm, the RIS controller adaptively coordinates the configuration of the RIS elements to maximize the received SINR. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TPC method over various system settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing OPE methods are ineffective for high-dimensional, long-horizon problems, due to exponential blow-ups in variance from importance weighting or compounding errors from learned dynamics models. To address these challenges, we propose STITCH-OPE, a model-based generative framework that leverages denoising diffusion for long-horizon OPE in high-dimensional state and action spaces. Starting with a diffusion model pre-trained on the behavior data, STITCH-OPE generates synthetic trajectories from the target policy by guiding the denoising process using the score function of the target policy. STITCH-OPE proposes two technical innovations that make it advantageous for OPE: (1) prevents over-regularization by subtracting the score of the behavior policy during guidance, and (2) generates long-horizon trajectories by stitching partial trajectories together end-to-end. We provide a theoretical guarantee that under mild assumptions, these modifications result in an exponential reduction in variance versus long-horizon trajectory diffusion. Experiments on the D4RL and OpenAI Gym benchmarks show substantial improvement in mean squared error, correlation, and regret metrics compared to state-of-the-art OPE methods.</p></details> |  |

Facing the dual eavesdropping threats, we aim to enhance the average achievable secrecy rate for the communication user by jointly designing the UAV trajectory together with the transmit information and sensing beamforming, while satisfying the requirements on sensing performance and sensing security, as well as the UAV power and flight constraints. To address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we employ the alternating optimization (AO) strategy, jointly with the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods.

| **[RRO: LLM Agent Optimization Through Rising Reward Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20737v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited extraordinary performance in a variety of tasks while it remains challenging for them to solve complex multi-step tasks as agents. In practice, agents sensitive to the outcome of certain key steps which makes them likely to fail the task because of a subtle mistake in the planning trajectory. Recent approaches resort to calibrating the reasoning process through reinforcement learning. They reward or penalize every reasoning step with process supervision, as known as Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, PRMs are difficult and costly to scale up with a large number of next action candidates since they require extensive computations to acquire the training data through the per-step trajectory exploration. To mitigate this issue, we focus on the relative reward trend across successive reasoning steps and propose maintaining an increasing reward in the collected trajectories for process supervision, which we term Reward Rising Optimization (RRO). Specifically, we incrementally augment the process supervision until identifying a step exhibiting positive reward differentials, i.e. rising rewards, relative to its preceding iteration. This method dynamically expands the search space for the next action candidates, efficiently capturing high-quality data. We provide mathematical groundings and empirical results on the WebShop and InterCode-SQL benchmarks, showing that our proposed RRO achieves superior performance while requiring much less exploration cost.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Towards Human-Like Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving: A Behavior-Centric Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21565v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the trajectories of vehicles is crucial for the development of autonomous driving (AD) systems, particularly in complex and dynamic traffic environments. In this study, we introduce HiT (Human-like Trajectory Prediction), a novel model designed to enhance trajectory prediction by incorporating behavior-aware modules and dynamic centrality measures. Unlike traditional methods that primarily rely on static graph structures, HiT leverages a dynamic framework that accounts for both direct and indirect interactions among traffic participants. This allows the model to capture the subtle yet significant influences of surrounding vehicles, enabling more accurate and human-like predictions. To evaluate HiT's performance, we conducted extensive experiments using diverse and challenging real-world datasets, including NGSIM, HighD, RounD, ApolloScape, and MoCAD++. The results demonstrate that HiT consistently outperforms other top models across multiple metrics, particularly excelling in scenarios involving aggressive driving behaviors. This research presents a significant step forward in trajectory prediction, offering a more reliable and interpretable approach for enhancing the safety and efficiency of fully autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACT-R: Adaptive Camera Trajectories for Single View 3D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08239v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the simple idea of adaptive view planning to multi-view synthesis, aiming to improve both occlusion revelation and 3D consistency for single-view 3D reconstruction. Instead of producing an unordered set of views independently or simultaneously, we generate a sequence of views, leveraging temporal consistency to enhance 3D coherence. More importantly, our view sequence is not determined by a pre-determined and fixed camera setup. Instead, we compute an adaptive camera trajectory (ACT), forming an orbit, which seeks to maximize the visibility of occluded regions of the 3D object to be reconstructed. Once the best orbit is found, we feed it to a video diffusion model to generate novel views around the orbit, which can then be passed to any multi-view 3D reconstruction model to obtain the final result. Our multi-view synthesis pipeline is quite efficient since it involves no run-time training/optimization, only forward inferences by applying pre-trained models for occlusion analysis and multi-view synthesis. Our method predicts camera trajectories that reveal occlusions effectively and produce consistent novel views, significantly improving 3D reconstruction over SOTA alternatives on the unseen GSO dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[OSVI-WM: One-Shot Visual Imitation for Unseen Tasks using World-Model-Guided Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20425v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual imitation learning enables robotic agents to acquire skills by observing expert demonstration videos. In the one-shot setting, the agent generates a policy after observing a single expert demonstration without additional fine-tuning. Existing approaches typically train and evaluate on the same set of tasks, varying only object configurations, and struggle to generalize to unseen tasks with different semantic or structural requirements. While some recent methods attempt to address this, they exhibit low success rates on hard test tasks that, despite being visually similar to some training tasks, differ in context and require distinct responses. Additionally, most existing methods lack an explicit model of environment dynamics, limiting their ability to reason about future states. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for one-shot visual imitation learning via world-model-guided trajectory generation. Given an expert demonstration video and the agent's initial observation, our method leverages a learned world model to predict a sequence of latent states and actions. This latent trajectory is then decoded into physical waypoints that guide the agent's execution. Our method is evaluated on two simulated benchmarks and three real-world robotic platforms, where it consistently outperforms prior approaches, with over 30% improvement in some cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training LLM-Based Agents with Synthetic Self-Reflected Trajectories and Partial Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20023v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents, which perceive environments and take actions to achieve goals, have become increasingly feasible with the advancements in large language models (LLMs). However, current powerful agents often depend on sophisticated prompt engineering combined with closed-source LLMs like GPT-4. Although training open-source LLMs using expert trajectories from teacher models has yielded some improvements in agent capabilities, this approach still faces limitations such as performance plateauing and error propagation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose STeP, a novel method for improving LLM-based agent training. We synthesize self-reflected trajectories that include reflections and corrections of error steps, which enhance the effectiveness of LLM agents in learning from teacher models, enabling them to become agents capable of self-reflecting and correcting. We also introduce partial masking strategy that prevents the LLM from internalizing incorrect or suboptimal steps. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves agent performance across three representative tasks: ALFWorld, WebShop, and SciWorld. For the open-source model LLaMA2-7B-Chat, when trained using self-reflected trajectories constructed with Qwen1.5-110B-Chat as the teacher model, it achieves comprehensive improvements with less training data compared to agents trained exclusively on expert trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deciphering Trajectory-Aided LLM Reasoning: An Optimization Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19815v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for comprehending the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through the perspective of meta-learning. By conceptualizing reasoning trajectories as pseudo-gradient descent updates to the LLM's parameters, we identify parallels between LLM reasoning and various meta-learning paradigms. We formalize the training process for reasoning tasks as a meta-learning setup, with each question treated as an individual task, and reasoning trajectories serving as the inner loop optimization for adapting model parameters. Once trained on a diverse set of questions, the LLM develops fundamental reasoning capabilities that can generalize to previously unseen questions. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the strong connection between LLM reasoning and meta-learning, exploring several issues of significant interest from a meta-learning standpoint. Our work not only enhances the understanding of LLM reasoning but also provides practical insights for improving these models through established meta-learning techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v2)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimpleDeepSearcher: Deep Information Seeking via Web-Powered Reasoning Trajectory Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16834v2)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have advanced large language models (LLMs) in complex deep search scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning and iterative information retrieval. However, existing approaches face critical limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for efficient deep search systems.

| **[Echo Planning for Autonomous Driving: From Current Observations to Future Trajectories and Back](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18945v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern end-to-end autonomous driving systems suffer from a critical limitation: their planners lack mechanisms to enforce temporal consistency between predicted trajectories and evolving scene dynamics. This absence of self-supervision allows early prediction errors to compound catastrophically over time. We introduce Echo Planning, a novel self-correcting framework that establishes a closed-loop Current - Future - Current (CFC) cycle to harmonize trajectory prediction with scene coherence. Our key insight is that plausible future trajectories must be bi-directionally consistent, ie, not only generated from current observations but also capable of reconstructing them. The CFC mechanism first predicts future trajectories from the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) scene representation, then inversely maps these trajectories back to estimate the current BEV state. By enforcing consistency between the original and reconstructed BEV representations through a cycle loss, the framework intrinsically penalizes physically implausible or misaligned trajectories. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, reducing L2 error by 0.04 m and collision rate by 0.12% compared to one-shot planners. Crucially, our method requires no additional supervision, leveraging the CFC cycle as an inductive bias for robust planning. This work offers a deployable solution for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Flow Matching for Geometric Trajectory Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18647v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The simulation of N-body systems is a fundamental problem with applications in a wide range of fields, such as molecular dynamics, biochemistry, and pedestrian dynamics. Machine learning has become an invaluable tool for scaling physics-based simulators and developing models directly from experimental data. In particular, recent advances based on deep generative modeling and geometric deep learning have enabled probabilistic simulation by modeling complex distributions over trajectories while respecting the permutation symmetry that is fundamental to N-body systems. However, to generate realistic trajectories, existing methods must learn complex transformations starting from uninformed noise and do not allow for the exploitation of domain-informed priors. In this work, we propose STFlow to address this limitation. By leveraging flow matching and data-dependent couplings, STFlow facilitates physics-informed simulation of geometric trajectories without sacrificing model expressivity or scalability. Our evaluation on N-body dynamical systems, molecular dynamics, and pedestrian dynamics benchmarks shows that STFlow produces significantly lower prediction errors while enabling more efficient inference, highlighting the benefits of employing physics-informed prior distributions in probabilistic geometric trajectory modeling.</p></details> | 20 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Optimization-Based Trajectory Planning for Tractor-Trailer Vehicles on Curvy Roads: A Progressively Increasing Sampling Number Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18590v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose an optimization-based trajectory planner for tractor-trailer vehicles on curvy roads. The lack of analytical expression for the trailer's errors to the center line pose a great challenge to the trajectory planning for tractor-trailer vehicles. To address this issue, we first use geometric representations to characterize the lateral and orientation errors in Cartesian frame, where the errors would serve as the components of the cost function and the road edge constraints within our optimization process. Next, we generate a coarse trajectory to warm-start the subsequent optimization problems. On the other hand, to achieve a good approximation of the continuous-time kinematics, optimization-based methods usually discretize the kinematics with a large sampling number. This leads to an increase in the number of the variables and constraints, thus making the optimization problem difficult to solve. To address this issue, we design a Progressively Increasing Sampling Number Optimization (PISNO) framework. More specifically, we first find a nearly feasible trajectory with a small sampling number to warm-start the optimization process. Then, the sampling number is progressively increased, and the corresponding intermediate Optimal Control Problem (OCP) is solved in each iteration. Next, we further resample the obtained solution into a finer sampling period, and then use it to warm-start the intermediate OCP in next iteration. This process is repeated until reaching a threshold sampling number. Simulation and experiment results show the proposed method exhibits a good performance and less computational consumption over the benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Do You Need for Diverse Trajectory Stitching in Diffusion Planning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18083v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In planning, stitching is an ability of algorithms to piece together sub-trajectories of data they are trained on to generate new and diverse behaviours. While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably stitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties are needed to compose: \emph{positional equivariance} and \emph{local receptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion planning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling. Experimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than positional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition, both are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple architecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive methods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based guidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable generalization in goal-conditioned settings.</p></details> | 9 Pages |

At the upper tier, a lightweight behavior-cloning network consumes six-axis force/torque streams from dual wrist-mounted sensors and outputs whole-body planar velocity commands that capture the leader's applied forces. At the lower tier, a deep-reinforcement-learning policy, trained under randomized payloads (0-3 kg) and friction conditions in Isaac Gym and validated in MuJoCo and on a real Unitree G1, maps these high-level twists to stable, under-load joint trajectories. By decoupling intent interpretation (force -> velocity) from legged locomotion (velocity -> joints), our method combines intuitive responsiveness to human inputs with robust, load-adaptive walking. We collect training data without motion-capture or markers, only synchronized RGB video and F/T readings, employing SAM2 and WHAM to extract 3D human pose and velocity. In real-world trials, our humanoid achieves cooperative carry-and-move performance (completion time, trajectory deviation, velocity synchrony, and follower-force) on par with a blindfolded human-follower baseline. This work is the first to demonstrate learned haptic guidance fused with full-body legged control for fluid human-humanoid co-manipulation.

However, existing methods for trajectory retrieval face notable limitations, including inefficiencies in large-scale data, lack of support for condition-based queries, and reliance on trajectory similarity measures. To address the above challenges, we propose OmniTraj, a generalized and flexible omni-semantic trajectory retrieval framework that integrates four complementary modalities or semantics -- raw trajectories, topology, road segments, and regions -- into a unified system. Unlike traditional approaches that are limited to computing and processing trajectories as a single modality, OmniTraj designs dedicated encoders for each modality, which are embedded and fused into a shared representation space. This design enables OmniTraj to support accurate and flexible queries based on any individual modality or combination thereof, overcoming the rigidity of traditional similarity-based methods. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniTraj in handling large-scale data, providing flexible, multi-modality queries, and supporting downstream tasks and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper by KDD'25 - Research Track</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory-Independent Flexibility Envelopes of Energy-Constrained Systems with State-Dependent Losses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16396v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As non-dispatchable renewable power units become prominent in electric power grids, demand-side flexibility appears as a key element of future power systems' operation. Power and energy bounds are intuitive metrics to describe the flexibility of energy-constrained loads. However, to be used in operation, any power consumption trajectory fulfilling the power and energy bounds must necessarily fulfill the load's constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that energy bounds defined as the minimum and maximum energy consumption potential of a load with state-dependent losses are Trajectory-Dependent (TD), i.e., for any energy value in the bounds a feasible power trajectory exists, but not all power trajectories enclosed in the energy envelopes satisfy the load's constraints. To guarantee the satisfaction of load constraints for all trajectories, we define Trajectory-Independent (TI) energy bounds. We present TI envelope formulations for individual loads, as well as physically coupled loads and assess the proposed formulations in a building heating system, a system with state-dependent losses. We find that using a TD envelope as energy bounds in operation may yield room temperature up to 3.8{\deg}C higher and 3.4{\deg}C lower than admissible. Overall, poorly insulated buildings observe a TI energy envelope that differs significantly from their TD envelope.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Trajectory Matching for Small-Scale Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15267v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying machine learning models in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices or rapid prototyping scenarios, increasingly demands distillation of large datasets into significantly smaller yet informative synthetic datasets. Current dataset distillation techniques, particularly Trajectory Matching methods, optimize synthetic data so that the model's training trajectory on synthetic samples mirrors that on real data. While demonstrating efficacy on medium-scale synthetic datasets, these methods fail to adequately preserve semantic richness under extreme sample scarcity. To address this limitation, we propose a novel dataset distillation method integrating contrastive learning during image synthesis. By explicitly maximizing instance-level feature discrimination, our approach produces more informative and diverse synthetic samples, even when dataset sizes are significantly constrained. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating contrastive learning substantially enhances the performance of models trained on very small-scale synthetic datasets. This integration not only guides more effective feature representation but also significantly improves the visual fidelity of the synthesized images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves notable performance improvements over existing distillation techniques, especially in scenarios with extremely limited synthetic data.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Toward Theoretical Insights into Diffusion Trajectory Distillation via Operator Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16024v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion trajectory distillation methods aim to accelerate sampling in diffusion models, which produce high-quality outputs but suffer from slow sampling speeds. These methods train a student model to approximate the multi-step denoising process of a pretrained teacher model in a single step, enabling one-shot generation. However, theoretical insights into the trade-off between different distillation strategies and generative quality remain limited, complicating their optimization and selection. In this work, we take a first step toward addressing this gap. Specifically, we reinterpret trajectory distillation as an operator merging problem in the linear regime, where each step of the teacher model is represented as a linear operator acting on noisy data. These operators admit a clear geometric interpretation as projections and rescalings corresponding to the noise schedule. During merging, signal shrinkage occurs as a convex combination of operators, arising from both discretization and limited optimization time of the student model. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal merging strategy that maximally preserves signal fidelity. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence of a sharp phase transition in the optimal strategy, governed by data covariance structures. Our findings enhance the theoretical understanding of diffusion trajectory distillation and offer practical insights for improving distillation strategies.</p></details> | 31 pages, 19 figures |

To address these issues, we propose SwarmDiff, a hierarchical and scalable generative framework for swarm robots. We model the swarm's macroscopic state using Probability Density Functions (PDFs) and leverage conditional diffusion models to generate risk-aware macroscopic trajectory distributions, which then guide the generation of individual robot trajectories at the microscopic level. To ensure a balance between the swarm's optimal transportation and risk awareness, we integrate Wasserstein metrics and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). Additionally, we introduce a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to improve sampling efficiency and generation quality by capturing long-range dependencies. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that SwarmDiff outperforms existing methods in computational efficiency, trajectory validity, and scalability, making it a reliable solution for swarm robotic trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Trajectory-Based Bayesian Approach to Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization with Epoch-Aware Trade-Offs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15303v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training machine learning models inherently involves a resource-intensive and noisy iterative learning procedure that allows epoch-wise monitoring of the model performance. However, the insights gained from the iterative learning procedure typically remain underutilized in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization scenarios. Despite the limited research in this area, existing methods commonly identify the trade-offs only at the end of model training, overlooking the fact that trade-offs can emerge at earlier epochs in cases such as overfitting. To bridge this gap, we propose an enhanced multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problem that treats the number of training epochs as a decision variable, rather than merely an auxiliary parameter, to account for trade-offs at an earlier training stage. To solve this problem and accommodate its iterative learning, we then present a trajectory-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm characterized by two features: 1) a novel acquisition function that captures the improvement along the predictive trajectory of model performances over epochs for any hyperparameter setting and 2) a multi-objective early stopping mechanism that determines when to terminate the training to maximize epoch efficiency. Experiments on synthetic simulations and hyperparameter tuning benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively identify the desirable trade-offs while improving tuning efficiency.</p></details> |  |

When system dynamics change unexpectedly, performance degrades until models are retrained on new data. We introduce Reflexive World Models (RWM), a dual control framework that uses world model predictions as implicit reference trajectories for rapid adaptation. Our method separates the control problem into long-term reward maximization through reinforcement learning and robust motor execution through rapid latent control. This dual architecture achieves significantly faster adaptation with low online computational cost compared to model-based RL baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance. The approach combines the benefits of flexible policy learning through reinforcement learning with rapid error correction capabilities, providing a principled approach to maintaining performance in high-dimensional continuous control tasks under varying dynamics.</p></details> |  |

However, linear models' expressive power and bias for real-world trajectories have not been thoroughly analyzed. We present an in-depth empirical analysis of the trade-off between model complexity and fit error in modelling object trajectories. We analyze vehicle, cyclist, and pedestrian trajectories. Our methodology estimates observation noise and prior distributions over model parameters from several large-scale datasets. Incorporating these priors can then regularize prediction models. Our results show that linear models do represent real-world trajectories with high fidelity at very moderate model complexity. This suggests the feasibility of using linear trajectory models in future motion prediction systems with inherent mathematical advantages.</p></details> |  |

To better understand the behavior of this metric, we systematically evaluate KL divergence across a wide range of conditions using publicly available language models. Our analysis covers comparisons between pretraining checkpoints, fine-tuned and base models, and layers via the logit lens. We find that trajectories of language models, as measured by KL divergence, exhibit a spiral structure during pretraining and thread-like progressions across layers. Furthermore, we show that, in terms of diffusion exponents, model trajectories in the log-likelihood space are more constrained than those in weight space.</p></details> |  |

We revisit the classical paradigm of Bellman Residual Minimization and introduce Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization (TBRM), an algorithm that naturally adapts this idea to LLMs, yielding a simple yet effective off-policy algorithm that optimizes a single trajectory-level Bellman objective using the model's own logits as $Q$-values. TBRM removes the need for critics, importance-sampling ratios, or clipping, and operates with only one rollout per prompt. We prove convergence to the near-optimal KL-regularized policy from arbitrary off-policy data via an improved change-of-trajectory-measure analysis. Experiments on standard mathematical-reasoning benchmarks show that TBRM consistently outperforms policy-based baselines, like PPO and GRPO, with comparable or lower computational and memory overhead. Our results indicate that value-based RL might be a principled and efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research often overlooks the driving risk field and fails to consider the impact of risk distribution within drivable areas on trajectory planning, which poses challenges for enhancing safety. This paper proposes a trajectory planning method for intelligent vehicles based on the risk reachable set to further improve the safety of trajectory planning. First, we construct the reachable set incorporating the driving risk field to more accurately assess and avoid potential risks in drivable areas. Then, the initial trajectory is generated based on safe reinforcement learning and projected onto the reachable set. Finally, we introduce a trajectory planning method based on a constrained iterative quadratic regulator to optimize the initial solution, ensuring that the planned trajectory achieves optimal comfort, safety, and efficiency. We conduct simulation tests of trajectory planning in high-speed lane-changing scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed method can guarantee trajectory comfort and driving efficiency, with the generated trajectory situated outside high-risk boundaries, thereby ensuring vehicle safety during operation.</p></details> | <details><summary>We si...</summary><p>We sincerely request the withdrawal of this paper.

| **[Learning Spatio-Temporal Dynamics for Trajectory Recovery via Time-Aware Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13857v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications, GPS trajectories often suffer from low sampling rates, with large and irregular intervals between consecutive GPS points. This sparse characteristic presents challenges for their direct use in GPS-based systems. This paper addresses the task of map-constrained trajectory recovery, aiming to enhance trajectory sampling rates of GPS trajectories. Previous studies commonly adopt a sequence-to-sequence framework, where an encoder captures the trajectory patterns and a decoder reconstructs the target trajectory. Within this framework, effectively representing the road network and extracting relevant trajectory features are crucial for overall performance. Despite advancements in these models, they fail to fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal dynamics present in both the trajectory and the road network. To overcome these limitations, we categorize the spatio-temporal dynamics of trajectory data into two distinct aspects: spatial-temporal traffic dynamics and trajectory dynamics. Furthermore, We propose TedTrajRec, a novel method for trajectory recovery. To capture spatio-temporal traffic dynamics, we introduce PD-GNN, which models periodic patterns and learns topologically aware dynamics concurrently for each road segment. For spatio-temporal trajectory dynamics, we present TedFormer, a time-aware Transformer that incorporates temporal dynamics for each GPS location by integrating closed-form neural ordinary differential equations into the attention mechanism. This allows TedFormer to effectively handle irregularly sampled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TedTrajRec. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ysygMhdxw/TEDTrajRec/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a journal paper in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> |
| **[HyperNet Fields: Efficiently Training Hypernetworks without Ground Truth by Learning Weight Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17040v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To efficiently adapt large models or to train generative models of neural representations, Hypernetworks have drawn interest. While hypernetworks work well, training them is cumbersome, and often requires ground truth optimized weights for each sample. However, obtaining each of these weights is a training problem of its own-one needs to train, e.g., adaptation weights or even an entire neural field for hypernetworks to regress to. In this work, we propose a method to train hypernetworks, without the need for any per-sample ground truth. Our key idea is to learn a Hypernetwork `Field` and estimate the entire trajectory of network weight training instead of simply its converged state. In other words, we introduce an additional input to the Hypernetwork, the convergence state, which then makes it act as a neural field that models the entire convergence pathway of a task network. A critical benefit in doing so is that the gradient of the estimated weights at any convergence state must then match the gradients of the original task -- this constraint alone is sufficient to train the Hypernetwork Field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through the task of personalized image generation and 3D shape reconstruction from images and point clouds, demonstrating competitive results without any per-sample ground truth.</p></details> |  |

We first extract dense optical flow from a reference video, and utilize the resulting motion offsets to warp the complex-exponential tensors of RoPE, effectively encoding motion into the generation process. These embeddings are then further optimized during denoising time steps via trajectory alignment between the predicted and target velocities using a flow-matching objective. To keep the output faithful to the text prompt and prevent duplicate generations, we incorporate a regularization term based on the phase components of the reference video's Fourier transform, projecting the phase angles onto a smooth manifold to suppress high-frequency artifacts. Experiments on benchmarks reveal that RoPECraft outperforms all recently published methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://berkegokmen1.github.io/RoPECraft/</p></details> |

DreamGen leverages state-of-the-art image-to-video generative models, adapting them to the target robot embodiment to produce photorealistic synthetic videos of familiar or novel tasks in diverse environments. Since these models generate only videos, we recover pseudo-action sequences using either a latent action model or an inverse-dynamics model (IDM). Despite its simplicity, DreamGen unlocks strong behavior and environment generalization: a humanoid robot can perform 22 new behaviors in both seen and unseen environments, while requiring teleoperation data from only a single pick-and-place task in one environment. To evaluate the pipeline systematically, we introduce DreamGen Bench, a video generation benchmark that shows a strong correlation between benchmark performance and downstream policy success.

| **[TransferTraj: A Vehicle Trajectory Learning Model for Region and Task Transferability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12672v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle GPS trajectories provide valuable movement information that supports various downstream tasks and applications. A desirable trajectory learning model should be able to transfer across regions and tasks without retraining, avoiding the need to maintain multiple specialized models and subpar performance with limited training data. However, each region has its unique spatial features and contexts, which are reflected in vehicle movement patterns and difficult to generalize. Additionally, transferring across different tasks faces technical challenges due to the varying input-output structures required for each task. Existing efforts towards transferability primarily involve learning embedding vectors for trajectories, which perform poorly in region transfer and require retraining of prediction modules for task transfer. To address these challenges, we propose TransferTraj, a vehicle GPS trajectory learning model that excels in both region and task transferability. For region transferability, we introduce RTTE as the main learnable module within TransferTraj. It integrates spatial, temporal, POI, and road network modalities of trajectories to effectively manage variations in spatial context distribution across regions. It also introduces a TRIE module for incorporating relative information of spatial features and a spatial context MoE module for handling movement patterns in diverse contexts. For task transferability, we propose a task-transferable input-output scheme that unifies the input-output structure of different tasks into the masking and recovery of modalities and trajectory points. This approach allows TransferTraj to be pre-trained once and transferred to different tasks without retraining. Extensive experiments on three real-world vehicle trajectory datasets under task transfer, zero-shot, and few-shot region transfer, validating TransferTraj's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

The proposed planner integrates real-time trajectory optimization with adaptive gap analysis, enabling effective feasibility assessment under partial observability constraints. To address safety-critical computations in unknown scenarios, an enhanced online learning mechanism is introduced, which dynamically corrects spatial trajectories by forming dynamic safety margins while maintaining control invariance. Extensive evaluations, including ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrate superior success rates and computational efficiency. The framework's effectiveness is further validated on both simulated and physical robotic platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Synthetic Human Trajectories: Imitative Generation and Benchmarks Beyond Datasaurus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13790v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory data, which plays a crucial role in various applications such as crowd management and epidemic prevention, is challenging to obtain due to practical constraints and privacy concerns. In this context, synthetic human trajectory data is generated to simulate as close as possible to real-world human trajectories, often under summary statistics and distributional similarities. However, these similarities oversimplify complex human mobility patterns (a.k.a. ``Datasaurus''), resulting in intrinsic biases in both generative model design and benchmarks of the generated trajectories. Against this background, we propose MIRAGE, a huMan-Imitative tRAjectory GenErative model designed as a neural Temporal Point Process integrating an Exploration and Preferential Return model. It imitates the human decision-making process in trajectory generation, rather than fitting any specific statistical distributions as traditional methods do, thus avoiding the Datasaurus issue. We also propose a comprehensive task-based evaluation protocol beyond Datasaurus to systematically benchmark trajectory generative models on four typical downstream tasks, integrating multiple techniques and evaluation metrics for each task, to assess the ultimate utility of the generated trajectories. We conduct a thorough evaluation of MIRAGE on three real-world user trajectory datasets against a sizeable collection of baselines. Results show that compared to the best baselines, MIRAGE-generated trajectory data not only achieves the best statistical and distributional similarities with 59.0-67.7% improvement, but also yields the best performance in the task-based evaluation with 10.9-33.4% improvement. A series of ablation studies also validate the key design choices of MIRAGE.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD'25 |

However, progress in this field is hindered by two key challenges: the over-reliance on older datasets from 2012-2013 and the lack of reproducible, city-level check-in datasets that reflect diverse global regions. To address these gaps, we present Massive-STEPS (Massive Semantic Trajectories for Understanding POI Check-ins), a large-scale, publicly available benchmark dataset built upon the Semantic Trails dataset and enriched with semantic POI metadata. Massive-STEPS spans 12 geographically and culturally diverse cities and features more recent (2017-2018) and longer-duration (24 months) check-in data than prior datasets. We benchmarked a wide range of POI recommendation models on Massive-STEPS using both supervised and zero-shot approaches, and evaluated their performance across multiple urban contexts. By releasing Massive-STEPS, we aim to facilitate reproducible and equitable research in human mobility and POI recommendation. The dataset and benchmarking code are available at: https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup/Massive-STEPS</p></details> |  |

Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions. Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories. We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 30 figures, Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Timely Trajectory Reconstruction in Finite Buffer Remote Tracking Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00849v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote tracking systems play a critical role in applications such as IoT, monitoring, surveillance and healthcare. In such systems, maintaining both real-time state awareness (for online decision making) and accurate reconstruction of historical trajectories (for offline post-processing) are essential. While the Age of Information (AoI) metric has been extensively studied as a measure of freshness, it does not capture the accuracy with which past trajectories can be reconstructed. In this work, we investigate reconstruction error as a complementary metric to AoI, addressing the trade-off between timely updates and historical accuracy. Specifically, we consider three policies, each prioritizing different aspects of information management: Keep-Old, Keep-Fresh, and our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy. We compare these policies in terms of impact on both AoI and reconstruction error in a remote tracking system with a finite buffer. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of queueing behavior, we demonstrate that while the Keep-Fresh policy minimizes AoI, it does not necessarily minimize reconstruction error. In contrast, our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy dynamically adjusts packet retention decisions based on generation times, achieving a balance between AoI and reconstruction error. Our results provide key insights into the design of efficient buffer management policies for resource-constrained IoT networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Interplanetary Trajectories using Hybrid Meta-heuristic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12399v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes an advanced hybrid optimization (GMPA) algorithm to effectively address the inherent limitations of the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) when applied to complex optimization scenarios. Specifically, GMPA integrates essential features from the Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) into the GWO framework, enabling superior performance through enhanced exploration and exploitation balance. The evaluation utilizes the GTOPX benchmark dataset from the European Space Agency (ESA), encompassing highly complex interplanetary trajectory optimization problems characterized by pronounced nonlinearity and multiple conflicting objectives reflective of real-world aerospace scenarios. Central to GMPA's methodology is an elite matrix, borrowed from MPA, designed to preserve and refine high-quality solutions iteratively, thereby promoting solution diversity and minimizing premature convergence. Furthermore, GMPA incorporates a three-phase position updating mechanism combined with L\'evy flights and Brownian motion to significantly bolster exploration capabilities, effectively mitigating the risk of stagnation in local optima. GMPA dynamically retains historical information on promising search areas, leveraging the memory storage features intrinsic to MPA, facilitating targeted exploitation and refinement. Empirical evaluations demonstrate GMPA's superior effectiveness compared to traditional GWO and other advanced metaheuristic algorithms, achieving markedly improved convergence rates and solution quality across GTOPX benchmarks. Consequently, GMPA emerges as a robust, efficient, and adaptive optimization approach particularly suitable for high-dimensional and complex aerospace trajectory optimization, offering significant insights and practical advancements in hybrid metaheuristic optimization techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Integrated Accessibility Analysis of Public Electric Vehicle Charging Stations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12145v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is crucial for advancing EV adoption, managing charging loads, and ensuring equitable transportation electrification. However, there remains a notable gap in comprehensive accessibility metrics that integrate the mobility of the users. This study introduces a novel accessibility metric, termed Trajectory-Integrated Public EVCS Accessibility (TI-acs), and uses it to assess public electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) accessibility for approximately 6 million residents in the San Francisco Bay Area based on detailed individual trajectory data in one week. Unlike conventional home-based metrics, TI-acs incorporates the accessibility of EVCS along individuals' travel trajectories, bringing insights on more public charging contexts, including public charging near workplaces and charging during grid off-peak periods. As of June 2024, given the current public EVCS network, Bay Area residents have, on average, 7.5 hours and 5.2 hours of access per day during which their stay locations are within 1 km (i.e. 10-12 min walking) of a public L2 and DCFC charging port, respectively. Over the past decade, TI-acs has steadily increased from the rapid expansion of the EV market and charging infrastructure. However, spatial disparities remain significant, as reflected in Gini indices of 0.38 (L2) and 0.44 (DCFC) across census tracts. Additionally, our analysis reveals racial disparities in TI-acs, driven not only by variations in charging infrastructure near residential areas but also by differences in their mobility patterns.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Knowledge-Informed Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction at Signalized Intersections for Infrastructure-to-Everything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13461v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory prediction at signalized intersections is crucial for developing efficient intelligent transportation systems and safe autonomous driving systems. Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. In this paper, we introduce an Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2X) collaborative prediction scheme. In this scheme, roadside units (RSUs) independently forecast the future trajectories of all vehicles and transmit these predictions unidirectionally to subscribing vehicles. Building on this scheme, we propose I2XTraj, a dedicated infrastructure-based trajectory prediction model. I2XTraj leverages real-time traffic signal states, prior maneuver strategy knowledge, and multi-agent interactions to generate accurate, joint multi-modal trajectory prediction. First, a continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals to guide trajectory proposal generation under varied intersection configurations. Second, a driving strategy awareness mechanism estimates the joint distribution of maneuver strategies by integrating spatial priors of intersection areas with dynamic vehicle states, enabling coverage of the full set of feasible maneuvers. Third, a spatial-temporal-mode attention network models multi-agent interactions to refine and adjust joint trajectory outputs.Finally, I2XTraj is evaluated on two real-world datasets of signalized intersections, the V2X-Seq and the SinD drone dataset. In both single-infrastructure and online collaborative scenarios, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 30\% on V2X-Seq and 15\% on SinD, demonstrating strong generalizability and robustness.</p></details> |  |

While robotic manipulators offer high precision, versatility, and productivity, they exhibit expressionless and monotonous motions that conceal the robot's intention, resulting in a lack of efficiency and transparency with humans. In this work, we use Laban notation, a dance annotation language, to enable robotic manipulators to generate trajectories with functional expressivity, where the robot uses nonverbal cues to communicate its abilities and the likelihood of succeeding at its task. We achieve this by introducing two novel variants of Hesitant expressive motion (Spoke-Like and Arc-Like). We also enhance the emotional expressivity of four existing emotive trajectories (Happy, Sad, Shy, and Angry) by augmenting Laban Effort usage with Laban Shape. The functionally expressive motions are validated via a human-subjects study, where participants equate both variants of Hesitant motion with reduced robot competency. The enhanced emotive trajectories are shown to be viewed as distinct emotions using the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) spectrum, corroborating the usage of Laban Shape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for the 2025 IEEE RO-MAN Conference</p></details> |

The algorithm estimates Markov parameters from a single trajectory and applies a variant of the Ho-Kalman algorithm to recover the system matrices.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first finite-sample bound for this algorithm in the single-trajectory setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active RLHF via Best Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18873v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of best policy identification in preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), where learning occurs from noisy binary preferences over trajectory pairs rather than explicit numerical rewards. This approach is useful for post-training optimization of generative AI models during multi-turn user interactions, where preference feedback is more robust than handcrafted reward models. In this setting, learning is driven by both an offline preference dataset -- collected from a rater of unknown `competence' -- and online data collected with pure exploration. Since offline datasets may exhibit out-of-distribution (OOD) biases, principled online data collection is necessary. To address this, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling, that maintains independent posteriors over the true reward model and transition dynamics. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for PbRL in this setting, establishing an upper bound on the simple Bayesian regret of $\mathsf{PSPL}$. Since the exact algorithm can be computationally impractical, we also provide an approximate version that outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, their large parameter size brings significant inference time computational challenges, including high encoding costs for large-scale corpora and increased query latency, limiting their practical deployment. While smaller retrievers offer better efficiency, they often fail to generalize effectively with limited supervised fine-tuning data. In this work, we introduce DRAMA, a training framework that leverages LLMs to train smaller generalizable dense retrievers. In particular, we adopt pruned LLMs as the backbone and train on diverse LLM-augmented data in a single-stage contrastive learning setup. Experiments show that DRAMA offers better multilingual and long-context capabilities than traditional encoder-based retrievers, and achieves strong performance across multiple tasks and languages. These highlight the potential of connecting the training of smaller retrievers with the growing advancements in LLMs, bridging the gap between efficiency and generalization.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

Many end-to-end approaches rely on human annotations to learn intermediate perception and prediction tasks, while purely self-supervised approaches--which directly learn from sensor inputs to generate planning trajectories without human annotations often underperform the state of the art. We observe a key gap in the input representation space: end-to-end approaches built on MLLMs are often pretrained with reasoning tasks in 2D image space rather than the native 3D space in which autonomous vehicles plan. To this end, we propose S4-Driver, a scalable self-supervised motion planning algorithm with spatio-temporal visual representation, based on the popular PaLI multimodal large language model. S4-Driver uses a novel sparse volume strategy to seamlessly transform the strong visual representation of MLLMs from perspective view to 3D space without the need to finetune the vision encoder. This representation aggregates multi-view and multi-frame visual inputs and enables better prediction of planning trajectories in 3D space. To validate our method, we run experiments on both nuScenes and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (with in-house camera data). Results show that S4-Driver performs favorably against existing supervised multi-task approaches while requiring no human annotations. It also demonstrates great scalability when pretrained on large volumes of unannotated driving logs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025; Project website: s4-driver.github.io</p></details> |

These capabilities have primarily been demonstrated within the left-to-right autoregressive (AR) generation paradigm. In contrast, non-autoregressive paradigms based on diffusion generate text in a coarse-to-fine manner. Although recent diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have achieved competitive language modeling performance compared to their AR counterparts, it remains unclear if dLLMs can also leverage recent advances in LLM reasoning. To this end, we propose d1, a framework to adapt pre-trained masked dLLMs into reasoning models via a combination of supervised finetuning (SFT) and RL. Specifically, we develop and extend techniques to improve reasoning in pretrained dLLMs: (a) we utilize a masked SFT technique to distill knowledge and instill self-improvement behavior directly from existing datasets, and (b) we introduce a novel critic-free, policy-gradient based RL algorithm called diffu-GRPO, the first integration of policy gradient methods to masked dLLMs. Through empirical studies, we investigate the performance of different post-training recipes on multiple mathematical and planning benchmarks. We find that d1 yields the best performance and significantly improves performance of a state-of-the-art dLLM.

Our method performs targeted data transformations by applying random noise perturbations to foreground objects and spatially shuffling background patches. This effectively increases the diversity of the training data, improving model robustness and generalization. Evaluations on the PACS dataset for SFDA demonstrate that our augmentation strategy consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving significant accuracy improvements in both single-target and multi-target adaptation settings. By augmenting training data through structured transformations, our method enables model generalization across domains, providing a scalable solution for reducing reliance on manually annotated datasets. Furthermore, experiments on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach for person ReID, surpassing traditional augmentation techniques.

This work focuses on the problem of effectively detecting fairness violations, especially intersectional biases that are often missed by existing template-based and grammar-based testing methods. Previous approaches, such as CheckList and ASTRAEA, provide structured or grammar-driven test generation but struggle with low test diversity and limited sensitivity to complex demographic interactions. To address these limitations, we propose GenFair, a metamorphic fairness testing framework that systematically generates source test cases using equivalence partitioning, mutation operators, and boundary value analysis. GenFair improves fairness testing by generating linguistically diverse, realistic, and intersectional test cases. It applies metamorphic relations (MR) to derive follow-up cases and detects fairness violations via tone-based comparisons between source and follow-up responses. In experiments with GPT-4.0 and LLaMA-3.0, GenFair outperformed two baseline methods. It achieved a fault detection rate (FDR) of 0.73 (GPT-4.0) and 0.69 (LLaMA-3.0), compared to 0.54/0.51 for template-based and 0.39/0.36 for ASTRAEA. GenFair also showed the highest test case diversity (syntactic:10.06, semantic: 76.68) and strong coherence (syntactic: 291.32, semantic: 0.7043), outperforming both baselines. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of GenFair in uncovering nuanced fairness violations. The proposed method offers a scalable and automated solution for fairness testing and contributes to building more equitable LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linear Representation Transferability Hypothesis: Leveraging Small Models to Steer Large Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00653v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been hypothesized that neural networks with similar architectures trained on similar data learn shared representations relevant to the learning task. We build on this idea by extending the conceptual framework where representations learned across models trained on the same data can be expressed as linear combinations of a \emph{universal} set of basis features. These basis features underlie the learning task itself and remain consistent across models, regardless of scale. From this framework, we propose the \textbf{Linear Representation Transferability (LRT)} Hypothesis -- that there exists an affine transformation between the representation spaces of different models. To test this hypothesis, we learn affine mappings between the hidden states of models of different sizes and evaluate whether steering vectors -- directions in hidden state space associated with specific model behaviors -- retain their semantic effect when transferred from small to large language models using the learned mappings. We find strong empirical evidence that such affine mappings can preserve steering behaviors. These findings suggest that representations learned by small models can be used to guide the behavior of large models, and that the LRT hypothesis may be a promising direction on understanding representation alignment across model scales.</p></details> |  |

Detecting Punishable Hate Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03009v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The assessment of legal problems requires the consideration of a specific legal system and its levels of abstraction, from constitutional law to statutory law to case law. The extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) internalize such legal systems is unknown. In this paper, we propose and investigate different approaches to condition LLMs at different levels of abstraction in legal systems. This paper examines different approaches to conditioning LLMs at multiple levels of abstraction in legal systems to detect potentially punishable hate speech. We focus on the task of classifying whether a specific social media posts falls under the criminal offense of incitement to hatred as prescribed by the German Criminal Code. The results show that there is still a significant performance gap between models and legal experts in the legal assessment of hate speech, regardless of the level of abstraction with which the models were conditioned. Our analysis revealed, that models conditioned on abstract legal knowledge lacked deep task understanding, often contradicting themselves and hallucinating answers, while models using concrete legal knowledge performed reasonably well in identifying relevant target groups, but struggled with classifying target conducts.</p></details> |  |

As empirical hypergraphs grow in size, characterizing their structural properties becomes increasingly challenging due to computational complexity and, in some cases, restricted access to complete data, requiring efficient sampling methods. Random walks offer a practical approach to hypergraph sampling, as they rely solely on local neighborhood information from nodes and hyperedges. In this study, we investigate methods for simultaneously sampling nodes and hyperedges via random walks on large hypergraphs. First, we compare three existing random walks in the context of hypergraph sampling and identify an advantage of the so-called higher-order random walk. Second, by extending an established technique for graphs to the case of hypergraphs, we present a non-backtracking variant of the higher-order random walk. We derive theoretical results on estimators based on the non-backtracking higher-order random walk and validate them through numerical simulations on large empirical hypergraphs. Third, we apply the non-backtracking higher-order random walk to a large hypergraph of co-authorships indexed in the OpenAlex database, where full access to the data is not readily available. Despite the relatively small sample size, our estimates largely align with previous findings on author productivity, team size, and the prevalence of open-access publications. Our findings contribute to the development of analysis methods for large hypergraphs, offering insights into sampling strategies and estimation techniques applicable to real-world complex systems.</p></details> |  |

Current deepfake detection methods often depend on datasets with limited generation models and content diversity that fail to keep pace with the evolving complexity and increasing realism of the AI-generated content. Large multimodal models (LMMs), widely adopted in various vision tasks, have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities, yet their potential in deepfake detection remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{DFBench}, a large-scale DeepFake Benchmark featuring (i) broad diversity, including 540,000 images across real, AI-edited, and AI-generated content, (ii) latest model, the fake images are generated by 12 state-of-the-art generation models, and (iii) bidirectional benchmarking and evaluating for both the detection accuracy of deepfake detectors and the evasion capability of generative models. Based on DFBench, we propose \textbf{MoA-DF}, Mixture of Agents for DeepFake detection, leveraging a combined probability strategy from multiple LMMs. MoA-DF achieves state-of-the-art performance, further proving the effectiveness of leveraging LMMs for deepfake detection. Database and codes are publicly available at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/DFBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iterative Methods for Full-Scale Gaussian Process Approximations for Large Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14492v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian processes are flexible probabilistic regression models which are widely used in statistics and machine learning. However, a drawback is their limited scalability to large data sets. To alleviate this, full-scale approximations (FSAs) combine predictive process methods and covariance tapering, thus approximating both global and local structures. We show how iterative methods can be used to reduce computational costs in calculating likelihoods, gradients, and predictive distributions with FSAs. In particular, we introduce a novel preconditioner and show theoretically and empirically that it accelerates the conjugate gradient method's convergence speed and mitigates its sensitivity with respect to the FSA parameters and the eigenvalue structure of the original covariance matrix, and we demonstrate empirically that it outperforms a state-of-the-art pivoted Cholesky preconditioner. Furthermore, we introduce an accurate and fast way to calculate predictive variances using stochastic simulation and iterative methods. In addition, we show how our newly proposed FITC preconditioner can also be used in iterative methods for Vecchia approximations. In our experiments, it outperforms existing state-of-the-art preconditioners for Vecchia approximations. All methods are implemented in a free C++ software library with high-level Python and R packages.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate whether LLMs implicitly encode linear spatial world models, which we define as linear representations of physical space and object configurations. We introduce a formal framework for spatial world models and assess whether such structure emerges in contextual embeddings. Using a synthetic dataset of object positions, we train probes to decode object positions and evaluate geometric consistency of the underlying space. We further conduct causal interventions to test whether these spatial representations are functionally used by the model. Our results provide empirical evidence that LLMs encode linear spatial world models.</p></details> |  |

Other than Chat GPT4 and its predecessors, few LLMs, especially those of the leading and more powerful reasoning model class, have been subjected to medical specialty examination questions, including in the domain of primary care. This paper aimed to test the capabilities of leading LLMs as of May 2025 (o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in primary care education, specifically in answering Member of the Royal College of General Practitioners (MRCGP) style examination questions. Methods: o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro were tasked to answer 100 randomly chosen multiple choice questions from the Royal College of General Practitioners GP SelfTest on 25 May 2025. Questions included textual information, laboratory results, and clinical images. Each model was prompted to answer as a GP in the UK and was provided with full question information. Each question was attempted once by each model. Responses were scored against correct answers provided by GP SelfTest. Results: The total score of o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro was 99.0%, 95.0%, 95.0%, and 95.0%, respectively. The average peer score for the same questions was 73.0%. Discussion: All models performed remarkably well, and all substantially exceeded the average performance of GPs and GP registrars who had answered the same questions. o3 demonstrated the best performance, while the performances of the other leading models were comparable with each other and were not substantially lower than that of o3. These findings strengthen the case for LLMs, particularly reasoning models, to support the delivery of primary care, especially those that have been specifically trained on primary care clinical data.</p></details> | 12 pages, 1 Table |
| **[Expanding before Inferring: Enhancing Factuality in Large Language Models through Premature Layers Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02973v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in text understanding and generation. However, their tendency to produce factually inconsistent outputs, commonly referred to as ''hallucinations'', remains a critical challenge. Existing approaches, such as retrieval-based and inference-time correction methods, primarily address this issue at the input or output level, often overlooking the intrinsic information refinement process and the role of premature layers. Meanwhile, alignment- and fine-tuning-based methods are resource-intensive. In this paper, we propose PLI (Premature Layers Interpolation), a novel, training-free, and plug-and-play intervention designed to enhance factuality. PLI mitigates hallucinations by inserting premature layers formed through mathematical interpolation with adjacent layers. Inspired by stable diffusion and sampling steps, PLI extends the depth of information processing and transmission in LLMs, improving factual coherence. Experiments on four publicly available datasets demonstrate that PLI effectively reduces hallucinations while outperforming existing baselines in most cases. Further analysis suggests that the success of layer interpolation is closely linked to LLMs' internal mechanisms. To promote reproducibility, we will release our code and data upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Federated Learning (FL) presents a compelling framework to address these challenges by enabling decentralized fine-tuning on pre-trained LLMs without sharing raw data. However, the compatibility and performance of pre-trained LLMs in FL settings remain largely under explored. We introduce the FlowerTune LLM Leaderboard, a first-of-its-kind benchmarking suite designed to evaluate federated fine-tuning of LLMs across four diverse domains: general NLP, finance, medical, and coding. Each domain includes federated instruction-tuning datasets and domain-specific evaluation metrics. Our results, obtained through a collaborative, open-source and community-driven approach, provide the first comprehensive comparison across 26 pre-trained LLMs with different aggregation and fine-tuning strategies under federated settings, offering actionable insights into model performance, resource constraints, and domain adaptation. This work lays the foundation for developing privacy-preserving, domain-specialized LLMs for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing publicly available datasets, the proposed system compares the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and different large language models (LLMs). This in-depth comparative analysis highlights key differences in diagnostic performance, execution efficiency, and environmental impacts. Model evaluation was based on accuracy, F1-score, average execution time, average energy consumption, and estimated $CO_2$ emission. The findings indicate that although CNN-based models can outperform various multimodal techniques that incorporate both images and contextual information, applying additional filtering on top of LLMs can lead to substantial performance gains. These findings highlight the transformative potential of multimodal AI systems to enhance the reliability, efficiency, and scalability of medical diagnostics in clinical settings.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Mousetrap: Fooling Large Reasoning Models for Jailbreak with Chain of Iterative Chaos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15806v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly advanced beyond traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) with their exceptional logical reasoning capabilities, yet these improvements introduce heightened safety risks. When subjected to jailbreak attacks, their ability to generate more targeted and organized content can lead to greater harm. Although some studies claim that reasoning enables safer LRMs against existing LLM attacks, they overlook the inherent flaws within the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we propose the first jailbreak attack targeting LRMs, exploiting their unique vulnerabilities stemming from the advanced reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we introduce a Chaos Machine, a novel component to transform attack prompts with diverse one-to-one mappings. The chaos mappings iteratively generated by the machine are embedded into the reasoning chain, which strengthens the variability and complexity and also promotes a more robust attack. Based on this, we construct the Mousetrap framework, which makes attacks projected into nonlinear-like low sample spaces with mismatched generalization enhanced. Also, due to the more competing objectives, LRMs gradually maintain the inertia of unpredictable iterative reasoning and fall into our trap. Success rates of the Mousetrap attacking o1-mini, Claude-Sonnet and Gemini-Thinking are as high as 96%, 86% and 98% respectively on our toxic dataset Trotter. On benchmarks such as AdvBench, StrongREJECT, and HarmBench, attacking Claude-Sonnet, well-known for its safety, Mousetrap can astonishingly achieve success rates of 87.5%, 86.58% and 93.13% respectively.

| **[Large Processor Chip Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02929v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer System Architecture serves as a crucial bridge between software applications and the underlying hardware, encompassing components like compilers, CPUs, coprocessors, and RTL designs. Its development, from early mainframes to modern domain-specific architectures, has been driven by rising computational demands and advancements in semiconductor technology. However, traditional paradigms in computer system architecture design are confronting significant challenges, including a reliance on manual expertise, fragmented optimization across software and hardware layers, and high costs associated with exploring expansive design spaces. While automated methods leveraging optimization algorithms and machine learning have improved efficiency, they remain constrained by a single-stage focus, limited data availability, and a lack of comprehensive human domain knowledge. The emergence of large language models offers transformative opportunities for the design of computer system architecture. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs in areas such as code generation, data analysis, and performance modeling, the traditional manual design process can be transitioned to a machine-based automated design approach. To harness this potential, we present the Large Processor Chip Model (LPCM), an LLM-driven framework aimed at achieving end-to-end automated computer architecture design. The LPCM is structured into three levels: Human-Centric; Agent-Orchestrated; and Model-Governed. This paper utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting as a representative workload and employs the concept of software-hardware collaborative design to examine the implementation of the LPCM at Level 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, this paper provides an in-depth discussion on the pathway to implementing Level 2 and Level 3 of the LPCM, along with an analysis of the existing challenges.</p></details> |  |

Crowd Decision Making (CDM) is a methodology able to infer opinions and decisions from plain texts, such as reviews published in social media platforms, by means of Sentiment Analysis. Currently, the emergence and potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) lead us to explore new scenarios of automatically understand written texts, also known as natural language processing. This paper analyzes the use of ChatGPT based on prompt design strategies to assist in CDM processes to extract opinions and make decisions. We integrate ChatGPT in CDM processes as a flexible tool that infer the opinions expressed in texts, providing numerical or linguistic evaluations where the decision making models are based on the prompt design strategies. We include a multi-criteria decision making scenario with a category ontology for criteria. We also consider ChatGPT as an end-to-end CDM model able to provide a general opinion and score on the alternatives. We conduct empirical experiments on real data extracted from TripAdvisor, the TripR-2020Large dataset. The analysis of results show a promising branch for developing quality decision making models using ChatGPT. Finally, we discuss the challenges of consistency, sensitivity and explainability associated to the use of LLMs in CDM processes, raising open questions for future studies.</p></details> |  |

We consider matrices of the form ${\mathbf B}_n=\frac{1}{n}{\mathbf T}_p^{1/2}{\mathbf X}_n{\mathbf X}_n^*{\mathbf T}_p^{1/2},$ where ${\mathbf X}_n= (x_{i j} ) $ is a $p \times n$ matrix whose entries are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) real or complex variables, and ${\mathbf T} _p$ is a $p\times p$ nonrandom Hermitian nonnegative definite matrix with its spectral norm uniformly bounded in $p$. Employing Stein's method, we establish that if the entries $x_{ij}$ satisfy $\mathbb{E}|x_{ij}|^{10}<\infty$ and the ratio of the dimension to sample size $p/n\to y>0$ as $n\to\infty$, then the convergence rate of the normalized LSS of ${\mathbf B}_n$ to the standard normal distribution, measured in the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, is $O(n^{-1/2+\kappa})$ for any fixed $\kappa>0$.</p></details> |  |

Current methods for improvement typically rely on splitting long contexts into fixed-length chunks. However, fixed truncation risks separating semantically relevant content, leading to ambiguity and compromising accurate understanding. To overcome this limitation, we propose a straightforward approach for dynamically separating and selecting chunks of long context, facilitating a more streamlined input for LLMs. In particular, we compute semantic similarities between adjacent sentences, using lower similarities to adaptively divide long contexts into variable-length chunks. We further train a question-aware classifier to select sensitive chunks that are critical for answering specific questions. Experimental results on both single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, it maintains robustness across a wide range of input lengths, handling sequences of up to 256k tokens.

Motivated by the success of reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks (e.g., DeepSeek), we explore Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as a framework to improve the NLU capabilities of LLMs. We frame NLU as a reinforcement learning environment, treating token generation as a sequence of actions and optimizing for reward signals based on alignment with ground-truth labels. PPO consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning, yielding an average improvement of 6.3 points on GLUE, and surpasses zero-shot and few-shot prompting by 38.7 and 26.1 points, respectively. Notably, PPO-tuned models outperform GPT-4o by over 4\% on average across sentiment and natural language inference tasks, including gains of 7.3\% on the Mental Health dataset and 10.9\% on SIGA-nli. This work highlights a promising direction for adapting LLMs to new tasks by reframing them as reinforcement learning problems, enabling learning through simple end-task rewards rather than extensive data curation.</p></details> |  |

Traditional systems like the U.S. federal income tax reduce inequality but lack adaptability. Although models like the Saez Optimal Taxation adjust dynamically, they fail to address taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. This study introduces TaxAgent, a novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) to design adaptive tax policies. In our macroeconomic simulation, heterogeneous H-Agents (households) simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors while the TaxAgent (government) utilizes LLMs to iteratively optimize tax rates, balancing equity and productivity. Benchmarked against Saez Optimal Taxation, U.S. federal income taxes, and free markets, TaxAgent achieves superior equity-efficiency trade-offs. This research offers a novel taxation solution and a scalable, data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as oral presentation at ICME 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we reveal a novel provider bias in LLMs: without explicit directives, these models show systematic preferences for services from specific providers in their recommendations (e.g., favoring Google Cloud over Microsoft Azure). To systematically investigate this bias, we develop an automated pipeline to construct the dataset, incorporating 6 distinct coding task categories and 30 real-world application scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of provider bias in LLM code generation across seven state-of-the-art LLMs, utilizing approximately 500 million tokens (equivalent to $5,000+ in computational costs). Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit significant provider preferences, predominantly favoring services from Google and Amazon, and can autonomously modify input code to incorporate their preferred providers without users' requests. Such a bias holds far-reaching implications for market dynamics and societal equilibrium, potentially contributing to digital monopolies. It may also deceive users and violate their expectations, leading to various consequences. We call on the academic community to recognize this emerging issue and develop effective evaluation and mitigation methods to uphold AI security and fairness.</p></details> | 27 pages, 13 figures |

To encode the attributes and graph structures simultaneously, recent studies integrate pre-trained models with graph neural networks (GNNs), where pre-trained models serve as node encoders (NEs) to encode the attributes. As jointly training large NEs and GNNs on large-scale graphs suffers from severe scalability issues, many methods propose to train NEs and GNNs separately. Consequently, they do not take feature convolutions in GNNs into consideration in the training phase of NEs, leading to a significant learning bias relative to the joint training. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient label regularization technique, namely Label Deconvolution (LD), to alleviate the learning bias by a novel and highly scalable approximation to the inverse mapping of GNNs. The inverse mapping leads to an objective function that is equivalent to that by the joint training, while it can effectively incorporate GNNs in the training phase of NEs against the learning bias. More importantly, we show that LD converges to the optimal objective function values by the joint training under mild assumptions. Experiments demonstrate LD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Open Graph Benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, for Indian languages, the development of high-quality RAG systems is hindered by the lack of two critical resources: (1) evaluation benchmarks for retrieval and generation tasks, and (2) large-scale training datasets for multilingual retrieval. Most existing benchmarks and datasets are centered around English or high-resource languages, making it difficult to extend RAG capabilities to the diverse linguistic landscape of India. To address the lack of evaluation benchmarks, we create IndicMSMarco, a multilingual benchmark for evaluating retrieval quality and response generation in 13 Indian languages, created via manual translation of 1000 diverse queries from MS MARCO-dev set. To address the need for training data, we build a large-scale dataset of (question, answer, relevant passage) tuples derived from the Wikipedias of 19 Indian languages using state-of-the-art LLMs. Additionally, we include translated versions of the original MS MARCO dataset to further enrich the training data and ensure alignment with real-world information-seeking tasks.

| **[Large Language Model Evaluation via Matrix Nuclear-Norm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10672v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, efficient evaluation metrics are vital for assessing their ability to compress information and reduce redundancy. While traditional metrics like Matrix Entropy offer valuable insights, they are computationally intensive for large-scale models due to their \( O(n^3) \) time complexity with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To mitigate this issue, we introduce the Matrix Nuclear-Norm, which not only serves as a metric to quantify the data compression proficiency of LLM but also provides a convex approximation of matrix rank to capture both predictive discriminability and diversity. By employing the \( L_{1,2}\text{-norm} \) to further approximate the nuclear norm, we can effectively assess the model's information compression capabilities. This approach reduces the time complexity to \( O(n^2) \) and eliminates the need for SVD computation. Consequently, the Matrix Nuclear-Norm achieves speeds 8 to 24 times faster than Matrix Entropy for the CEREBRAS-GPT model as sizes increase from 111M to 6.7B. This performance gap becomes more pronounced with larger models, as validated in tests with other models like Pythia. Additionally, evaluations on benchmarks and model responses confirm that our proposed Matrix Nuclear-Norm is a reliable, scalable, and efficient tool for assessing LLMs' performance, striking a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

Furthermore, our finetuned models can expertly answer questions on specific topics by integrating powerful guidance techniques, and autonomously determine the compute required for a given problem by leveraging adaptive ODE solvers. Our method is universally applicable to any foundation model pre-trained with a cross-entropy loss and does not modify any of its original weights, fully preserving its strong single-step generation capabilities. We show our method is more effective and fully compatible with traditional finetuning approaches, introducing an orthogonal new direction to unify the strengths of the autoregressive and diffusion frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version, presented at ICML 2025.

A key question that now preoccupies the AI community concerns the capabilities and limitations of these models, with trustworthiness emerging as a central issue, particularly as LLMs are increasingly applied in sensitive fields like healthcare and finance, where errors can have serious consequences. However, most previous studies on the trustworthiness of LLMs have been limited to a single language, typically the predominant one in the dataset, such as English. In response to the growing global deployment of LLMs, we introduce XTRUST, the first comprehensive multilingual trustworthiness benchmark. XTRUST encompasses a diverse range of topics, including illegal activities, hallucination, out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, physical and mental health, toxicity, fairness, misinformation, privacy, and machine ethics, across 10 different languages. Using XTRUST, we conduct an empirical evaluation of the multilingual trustworthiness of five widely used LLMs, offering an in-depth analysis of their performance across languages and tasks. Our results indicate that many LLMs struggle with certain low-resource languages, such as Arabic and Russian, highlighting the considerable room for improvement in the multilingual trustworthiness of current language models.

State-of-the-art methods employ 3D Gaussians to represent a scene, and render these Gaussians through splatting for higher efficiency and better rendering. However, these methods cannot scale up to extremely large scenes, due to the inefficient tracking and mapping strategies that need to optimize all 3D Gaussians in the limited GPU memories throughout the training to maintain the geometry and color consistency to previous RGBD observations. To resolve this issue, we propose novel tracking and mapping strategies to work with a novel 3D representation, dubbed view-tied 3D Gaussians, for RGBD SLAM systems. View-tied 3D Gaussians is a kind of simplified Gaussians, which is tied to depth pixels, without needing to learn locations, rotations, and multi-dimensional variances. Tying Gaussians to views not only significantly saves storage but also allows us to employ many more Gaussians to represent local details in the limited GPU memory. Moreover, our strategies remove the need of maintaining all Gaussians learnable throughout the training, while improving rendering quality, and tracking accuracy. We justify the effectiveness of these designs, and report better performance over the latest methods on the widely used benchmarks in terms of rendering and tracking accuracy and scalability.

Prior work on subfigure extraction has been limited in both dataset size and generalizability, leaving a critical open question: How does high-fidelity image-text alignment via large-scale subfigure extraction impact representation learning in vision-language models? We address this gap by introducing a scalable subfigure extraction pipeline based on transformer-based object detection, trained on a synthetic corpus of 500,000 compound figures, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on both ImageCLEF 2016 and synthetic benchmarks. Using this pipeline, we release OPEN-PMC-18M, a large-scale high quality biomedical vision-language dataset comprising 18 million clinically relevant subfigure-caption pairs spanning radiology, microscopy, and visible light photography. We train and evaluate vision-language models on our curated datasets and show improved performance across retrieval, zero-shot classification, and robustness benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines. We release our dataset, models, and code to support reproducible benchmarks and further study into biomedical vision-language modeling and representation learning.</p></details> | 15 pages |

To unleash its potential, this paper proposes a novel architecture, namely extremely large-scale MA (XL-MA), which allows flexible antenna/subarray positioning over an extremely large spatial region for effectively enhancing near-field effects and spatial multiplexing performance. In particular, this paper studies an uplink XL-MA-enabled multiuser system, where single-antenna users distributed in a coverage area are served by a base station (BS) equipped with multiple movable subarrays. We begin by presenting a spatially non-stationary channel model to capture the near-field effects, including positiondependent large-scale channel gains and line-of-sight visibility. To evaluate system performance, we further derive a closedform approximation of the expected weighted sum rate under maximum ratio combining (MRC), revealing that optimizing XLMA placement enhances user channel power gain to increase desired signal power and reduces channel correlation to decreases multiuser interference. Building upon this, we formulate an antenna placement optimization problem to maximize the expected weighted sum rate, leveraging statistical channel conditions and user distribution. To efficiently solve this challenging non-linear binary optimization problem, we propose a polynomial-time successive replacement algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed XL-MA placement strategy achieves nearoptimal performance, significantly outperforming benchmark schemes based on conventional fixed-position antennas.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Traditional preference alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) often overlook the underlying knowledge sources and reasoning logic. This paper introduces RACE-Align (Retrieval-Augmented and Chain-of-Thought Enhanced Alignment), a novel framework designed to address these limitations. RACE-Align systematically constructs a binary preference dataset incorporating external knowledge support and explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, then aligns LLMs using the DPO algorithm. The core innovation lies in its preference data construction strategy: it integrates AI-driven retrieval for factual grounding, enhancing knowledgeability and accuracy, and emphasizes the optimization of domain-specific CoT, treating the reasoning process itself as a key preference dimension. A multi-stage, AI-driven refinement pipeline cost-effectively generates these preference pairs. Experimental validation in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) using Qwen3-1.7B as the base model demonstrates that RACE-Align significantly outperforms the original base model and a model fine-tuned only with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Improvements were observed across multiple dimensions, including answer accuracy, information richness, application of TCM thinking patterns, logicality and depth of reasoning, and interpretability. These findings suggest RACE-Align offers an effective pathway to enhance LLMs' knowledge application, reasoning reliability, and process transparency in complex vertical domains.</p></details> |  |

What Matters and What Does Not](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17044v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable performance achieved by Large Language Models (LLM) has driven research efforts to leverage them for a wide range of tasks and input modalities. In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation. Our results demonstrate that the SFM plays a pivotal role in downstream performance, while the adapter choice has moderate impact and depends on the SFM and LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

Building on this progress, we investigate their potential in the realm of local life services. In this study, we establish a comprehensive benchmark and systematically evaluate the performance of diverse LLMs across a wide range of tasks relevant to local life services. To further enhance their effectiveness, we explore two key approaches: model fine-tuning and agent-based workflows. Our findings reveal that even a relatively compact 7B model can attain performance levels comparable to a much larger 72B model, effectively balancing inference cost and model capability. This optimization greatly enhances the feasibility and efficiency of deploying LLMs in real-world online services, making them more practical and accessible for local life applications.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |

When doing so, it is common practice to include a portion of English data in the mixture, but its role has not been carefully studied to date. In this work, we show that including English does not impact validation perplexity, yet it is critical for the emergence of downstream capabilities in the target language. We introduce a language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL), which reveals catastrophic forgetting early on CPT when English is not included. This in turn damages the ability of the model to generalize to downstream prompts in the target language as measured by perplexity, even if it does not manifest in terms of accuracy until later in training, and can be tied to a big shift in the model parameters. Based on these insights, we introduce curriculum learning and exponential moving average (EMA) of weights as effective alternatives to mitigate the need for English. All in all, our work sheds light into the dynamics by which emergent abilities arise when doing CPT for language adaptation, and can serve as a foundation to design more effective methods in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ACL 2025 Main</p></details> |
| **[Open-Set Living Need Prediction with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02713v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Living needs are the needs people generate in their daily lives for survival and well-being. On life service platforms like Meituan, user purchases are driven by living needs, making accurate living need predictions crucial for personalized service recommendations. Traditional approaches treat this prediction as a closed-set classification problem, severely limiting their ability to capture the diversity and complexity of living needs. In this work, we redefine living need prediction as an open-set classification problem and propose PIGEON, a novel system leveraging large language models (LLMs) for unrestricted need prediction. PIGEON first employs a behavior-aware record retriever to help LLMs understand user preferences, then incorporates Maslow's hierarchy of needs to align predictions with human living needs. For evaluation and application, we design a recall module based on a fine-tuned text embedding model that links flexible need descriptions to appropriate life services. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that PIGEON significantly outperforms closed-set approaches on need-based life service recall by an average of 19.37%. Human evaluation validates the reasonableness and specificity of our predictions. Additionally, we employ instruction tuning to enable smaller LLMs to achieve competitive performance, supporting practical deployment.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Towards the Worst-case Robustness of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19040v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of large language models to adversarial attacks, where adversaries craft specific input sequences to induce harmful, violent, private, or incorrect outputs. In this work, we study their worst-case robustness, i.e., whether an adversarial example exists that leads to such undesirable outputs. We upper bound the worst-case robustness using stronger white-box attacks, indicating that most current deterministic defenses achieve nearly 0\% worst-case robustness. We propose a general tight lower bound for randomized smoothing using fractional knapsack solvers or 0-1 knapsack solvers, and using them to bound the worst-case robustness of all stochastic defenses. Based on these solvers, we provide theoretical lower bounds for several previous empirical defenses. For example, we certify the robustness of a specific case, smoothing using a uniform kernel, against \textit{any possible attack} with an average $\ell_0$ perturbation of 2.02 or an average suffix length of 6.41.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Tug of War Within: Mitigating the Fairness-Privacy Conflicts in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16672v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring awareness of fairness and privacy in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical. Interestingly, we discover a counter-intuitive trade-off phenomenon that enhancing an LLM's privacy awareness through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods significantly decreases its fairness awareness with thousands of samples. To address this issue, inspired by the information theory, we introduce a training-free method to \textbf{S}uppress the \textbf{P}rivacy and fa\textbf{I}rness coupled \textbf{N}eurons (\textbf{SPIN}), which theoretically and empirically decrease the mutual information between fairness and privacy awareness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SPIN eliminates the trade-off phenomenon and significantly improves LLMs' fairness and privacy awareness simultaneously without compromising general capabilities, \eg improving Qwen-2-7B-Instruct's fairness awareness by 12.2\% and privacy awareness by 14.0\%. More crucially, SPIN remains robust and effective with limited annotated data or even when only malicious fine-tuning data is available, whereas SFT methods may fail to perform properly in such scenarios. Furthermore, we show that SPIN could generalize to other potential trade-off dimensions. We hope this study provides valuable insights into concurrently addressing fairness and privacy concerns in LLMs and can be integrated into comprehensive frameworks to develop more ethical and responsible AI systems.

| **[Exposing Numeracy Gaps: A Benchmark to Evaluate Fundamental Numerical Abilities in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11075v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing tasks, such as text generation and semantic understanding. However, their performance on numerical reasoning tasks, such as basic arithmetic, numerical retrieval, and magnitude comparison, remains surprisingly poor. This gap arises from their reliance on surface-level statistical patterns rather than understanding numbers as continuous magnitudes. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on either linguistic competence or structured mathematical problem-solving, neglecting fundamental numerical reasoning required in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose NumericBench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate six fundamental numerical capabilities: number recognition, arithmetic operations, contextual retrieval, comparison, summary, and logical reasoning. NumericBench includes datasets ranging from synthetic number lists to the crawled real-world data, addressing challenges like long contexts, noise, and multi-step reasoning. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4 and DeepSeek, reveal persistent weaknesses in numerical reasoning, highlighting the urgent need to improve numerically-aware language modeling. The benchmark is released in: https://github.com/TreeAI-Lab/NumericBench.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |
| **[Enhancing Ultra-Low-Bit Quantization of Large Language Models Through Saliency-Aware Partial Retraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13932v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing use of large language models has raised environmental and economic concerns about their intensity of resource usage during inference. Serving these models to each user requires substantial energy and water for cooling. Model compression techniques like quantization can shrink large language models and make them more resource efficient at the cost of potential performance degradation. Quantization methods compress model size through replacing their high-precision parameters by quantized values of lower precision. Among existing methods, the ApiQ method achieves superior accuracy preservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two ideas to extend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level. First, we look into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques with ApiQ's partial training. We show that this does not outperform the baseline ApiQ method with limited training data and frozen weights. This leads to two key insights: (1) The substantial representational capacity that is gained through full retraining is unlikely to be feasible through partial training. (2) This gain may depend on using a large and diverse dataset in quantization-aware training. Second, through a novel approach informed by the two insights, we propose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon ApiQ and extends its performance without the need for full retraining. This publicly available method relies on a saliency-aware regularization term that prioritizes preserving the most impactful parameters during quantization. Our experiments on LLaMA 7B and 13B benchmarks demonstrate that our method reduces the ApiQ's accuracy degradation by 10.85\% and 7.54\% respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a post-peer-review accepted manuscript from the proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence (MDAI'25).

While existing AI-driven approaches alleviate annotation burdens via self-supervised spatial representation learning, their lack of explicit temporal modeling during pre-training fundamentally restricts the capture of dynamic surgical contexts, resulting in incomplete spatiotemporal understanding. In this work, we introduce the first video-level surgical pre-training framework that enables joint spatiotemporal representation learning from large-scale surgical video data. To achieve this, we constructed a large-scale surgical video dataset comprising 3,650 videos and approximately 3.55 million frames, spanning more than 20 surgical procedures and over 10 anatomical structures. Building upon this dataset, we propose SurgVISTA (Surgical Video-level Spatial-Temporal Architecture), a reconstruction-based pre-training method that captures intricate spatial structures and temporal dynamics through joint spatiotemporal modeling. Additionally, SurgVISTA incorporates image-level knowledge distillation guided by a surgery-specific expert to enhance the learning of fine-grained anatomical and semantic features. To validate its effectiveness, we established a comprehensive benchmark comprising 13 video-level datasets spanning six surgical procedures across four tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgVISTA consistently outperforms both natural- and surgical-domain pre-trained models, demonstrating strong potential to advance intelligent surgical systems in clinically meaningful scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This survey systematically synthesizes GPS advancements through three core dimensions: (1) benchmark construction, (2) textual and diagrammatic parsing, and (3) reasoning paradigms. We further propose a unified analytical paradigm, assess current limitations, and identify emerging opportunities to guide future research toward human-level geometric reasoning, including automated benchmark generation and interpretable neuro-symbolic integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>8page...</summary><p>8pages, 4 figures, conference submission</p></details> |

However, obtaining high-quality fine-tuning data for large models is challenging due to data collection difficulties and high production costs. To address this, we propose MASTER, a novel data augmentation method that enriches original data through interactions among multiple agents with varying cognitive levels. We simulate three pedagogically grounded teaching scenarios, leveraging multi-agent conversations to generate high-quality teacher-student interaction data. Utilizing MASTER, we construct BOOST-QA, a fine-tuning dataset augmented from existing datasets like Orca-Math-200k, ProcQA, and OpenHermes2.5. Experiments show that models fine-tuned with BOOST-QA perform excellently across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong multitask generalization. Notably, MASTER significantly improves models' reasoning abilities in complex tasks, providing valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

Existing planning methods face two key limitations: heavy constraints and cascading errors. To address these limitations, we propose a novel parallel planning paradigm, which Decomposes, Plans for subtasks in Parallel, and Merges subplans into a final plan (DPPM). Specifically, DPPM decomposes the complex task based on constraints into subtasks, generates the subplan for each subtask in parallel, and merges them into a global plan. In addition, our approach incorporates a verification and refinement module, enabling error correction and conflict resolution. Experimental results demonstrate that DPPM significantly outperforms existing methods in travel planning tasks.</p></details> |  |

While manually designing tree annotation schemes significantly improves annotation quality for humans and models, their creation remains time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. We propose a fully automated pipeline that uses LLMs to construct such schemes and perform annotation. We evaluate our approach on speech functions (SFs) and the Switchboard-DAMSL (SWBD-DAMSL) taxonomies. Our experiments compare various design choices, and we show that frequency-guided decision trees, paired with an advanced LLM for annotation, can outperform previously manually designed trees and even match or surpass human annotators while significantly reducing the time required for annotation. We release all code and resultant schemes and annotations to facilitate future research on discourse annotation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computational Thinking Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02658v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, they often struggle with complex tasks that require specific thinking paradigms, such as divide-and-conquer and procedural deduction, \etc Previous researches integrate external, reliable tools to alleviate logical inconsistencies and hallucinations in LLMs' problem-solving processes. However, we argue that the root challenge is more profound: LLMs lack the complex thinking paradigms (\ie, computational thinking) during reasoning. In this paper, we propose Computational Thinking Model (CTM), a novel framework that incorporates computational thinking paradigms into LLMs. This framework enables LLMs to reformulate complex problems through decomposition, abstraction, reduction, and simulation, among other techniques. Specifically, live code execution is seamlessly integrated into the reasoning process, allowing CTM to think by computing. CTM directly instills computational thinking objectives into LLMs through tailored reinforcement learning rewards, which encourages problem simplification, modular planning, and iterative verification. We conduct extensive evaluations on multiple code generation and mathematical benchmarks. The results demonstrate that CTM outperforms conventional reasoning models and tool-augmented baselines in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and generalizability. We hope this study offers valuable insights for AI reasoning, where LLMs can transform problems into robust, verifiable, and scalable computational workflows, much like computer scientists do.</p></details> |  |

Its agility and ability to optimize mobility and establish Line-of-Sight (LoS) communication make it increasingly vital for managing emergencies such as disaster response, search and rescue, and wildfire monitoring. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been applied to optimize UAV navigation and control, its high training complexity, low sample efficiency, and simulation-to-reality gap limit its practicality in public safety. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation via natural language prompts and example-based guidance, without retraining. Deploying LLMs at the network edge, rather than in the cloud, further reduces latency and preserves data privacy, thereby making them suitable for real-time, mission-critical public safety UAVs. This paper proposes the integration of LLM-enabled ICL with public safety UAV to address the key functions, such as path planning and velocity control, in the context of emergency response. We present a case study on data collection scheduling where the LLM-enabled ICL framework can significantly reduce packet loss compared to conventional approaches, while also mitigating potential jailbreaking vulnerabilities. Finally, we discuss LLM optimizers and specify future research directions. The ICL framework enables adaptive, context-aware decision-making for public safety UAV, thus offering a lightweight and efficient solution for enhancing UAV autonomy and responsiveness in emergencies.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

However, whether LLMs possess genuine fluid intelligence (i.e., the ability to reason abstractly and generalize rules in novel situations) remains an open question. Existing reasoning benchmarks either focus on domain-specific knowledge (crystallized intelligence) or lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose DRE-Bench, a dynamic reasoning evaluation benchmark grounded in a hierarchical cognitive framework. DRE-Bench consists of 36 abstract reasoning tasks organized across four cognitive levels, with each task featuring multiple dynamic variants that test the same underlying latent rule. This design enables fine-grained, interpretable, and reliable assessments of fluid intelligence. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art LLMs, including both general LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.7) and reasoning LLMs (o1, DeepSeek-R1, QwQ, Skywork-OR1). Experimental results reveal that although most LLMs achieve competent and robust performance in low-level cognition, they struggle with high-level cognition and exhibit limited generalization as task complexity grows. Our findings highlight the gap between current LLMs and true human-like fluid intelligence and offer a new path for systematically tracking reasoning progress in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we focus on a unified and robust evaluation of \textbf{vision perception} abilities, the foundational skill of MLLMs. We find that existing perception benchmarks, each focusing on different question types, domains, and evaluation metrics, introduce significant evaluation variance, complicating comprehensive assessments of perception abilities when relying on any single benchmark.

However, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV\$ caching, where system design decisions like cache eviction policies are highly workload-dependent. In this paper, we present the first systematic characterization of the KV\$ workload patterns from one of the leading LLM service providers. We draw observations that were not covered by previous studies focusing on synthetic workloads, including: KV\$ reuses are skewed across requests, where reuses between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests; the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable; and the overall cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate. Based on the characterization, we further propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX ATC'25</p></details> |

However, existing methods for source code embedding, including those based on LLMs, often rely on costly supervised training or fine-tuning for domain adaptation. This paper proposes a novel approach to embedding source code by combining large language and sentence embedding models. This approach attempts to eliminate the need for task-specific training or fine-tuning and to effectively address the issue of erroneous information commonly found in LLM-generated outputs. To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we conducted a series of experiments on three datasets with different programming languages by considering various LLMs and sentence embedding models. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, such as SourcererCC, Code2vec, InferCode, TransformCode, and LLM2Vec. Our findings highlight the potential of our approach to advance the field of SE by providing robust and efficient solutions for source code embedding tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are mainly based on traditional signal processing, which cannot effectively process the complex background and dense space debris. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based Space Debris Tracking Network~(SDT-Net) to achieve highly accurate debris tracking. SDT-Net effectively represents the feature of debris, enhancing the efficiency and stability of end-to-end model learning. To train and evaluate this model effectively, we also produce a large-scale dataset Space Debris Tracking Dataset (SDTD) by a novel observation-based data simulation scheme. SDTD contains 18,040 video sequences with a total of 62,562 frames and covers 250,000 synthetic space debris. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model and the challenging of our dataset. Furthermore, we test our model on real data from the Antarctic Station, achieving a MOTA score of 70.6%, which demonstrates its strong transferability to real-world scenarios.

Understanding the internal operations behind RaaS has been a challenge due to the illegality of such activities. The recent chat leak of the Conti RaaS operator, one of the most infamous ransomware operators on the international scene, offers a key opportunity to better understand the inner workings of such organizations. This paper analyzes the main topic discussions in the Conti chat leak using machine learning techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), as well as visualization strategies. Five discussion topics are found: 1) Business, 2) Technical, 3) Internal tasking/Management, 4) Malware, and 5) Customer Service/Problem Solving. Moreover, the distribution of topics among Conti members shows that only 4% of individuals have specialized discussions while almost all individuals (96%) are all-rounders, meaning that their discussions revolve around the five topics. The results also indicate that a significant proportion of Conti discussions are non-tech related. This study thus highlights that running such large RaaS operations requires a workforce skilled beyond technical abilities, with individuals involved in various tasks, from management to customer service or problem solving. The discussion topics also show that the organization behind the Conti RaaS oper5086933ator shares similarities with a large firm. We conclude that, although RaaS represents an example of specialization in the cybercrime industry, only a few members are specialized in one topic, while the rest runs and coordinates the RaaS operation.</p></details> |  |

Most existing robustness verification methods assess the worst-case output under the assumption that the input space is known. However, precisely identifying a verifiable input space \(\mathcal{C}\), where no adversarial examples exist, is challenging due to the possible high dimensionality, discontinuity, and non-convex nature of the input space. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, **LEVIS**, consisting of **LEVIS-{\alpha}** and **LEVIS-\b{eta}**. **LEVIS-{\alpha}** identifies a single, large verifiable ball that intersects at least two boundaries of a bounded region \(\mathcal{C}\), while **LEVIS-\b{eta}** systematically captures the entirety of the verifiable space by integrating multiple verifiable balls. Our contributions include: (1) introducing a verification framework that uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) to compute nearest and directional adversarial points, (2) integrating complementarity-constrained (CC) optimization with a reduced MIP formulation for scalability, achieving up to a 6 times runtime reduction, (3) theoretically characterizing the properties of the verifiable balls obtained by **LEVIS-{\alpha}**, and (4) validating the approach across applications including electrical power flow regression and image classification, with demonstrated performance gains and geometric insights into the verifiable region.</p></details> |  |

Despite their importance, negations pose a substantial challenge for large language models (LLMs) and remain underexplored. We constructed and published two new textual entailment datasets NoFEVER-ML and NoSNLI-ML in four languages (English, Czech, German, and Ukrainian) with examples differing in negation. It allows investigation of the root causes of the negation problem and its exemplification: how popular LLM model properties and language impact their inability to handle negation correctly. Contrary to previous work, we show that increasing the model size may improve the models' ability to handle negations. Furthermore, we find that both the models' reasoning accuracy and robustness to negation are language-dependent and that the length and explicitness of the premise have an impact on robustness. There is better accuracy in projective language with fixed order, such as English, than in non-projective ones, such as German or Czech. Our entailment datasets pave the way to further research for explanation and exemplification of the negation problem, minimization of LLM hallucinations, and improvement of LLM reasoning in multilingual settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks often rely on coarse-grained text quality metrics, largely overlooking the structural and rhetorical complexities of Chinese essays, particularly across diverse genres. To address this gap, we propose \benchName, a multi-genre benchmark specifically designed for Chinese essay writing across four major genres: Argumentative, Narrative, Descriptive, and Expository. We curate and refine a total of 728 real-world prompts to ensure authenticity and meticulously categorize them into the \textit{Open-Ended} and \textit{Constrained} sets to capture diverse writing scenarios. To reliably evaluate generated essays, we develop a fine-grained, genre-specific scoring framework that hierarchically aggregates scores. We further validate our evaluation protocol through a comprehensive human agreement study. Finally, we benchmark 15 large-sized LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations across genres and instruction types. With \benchName, we aim to advance LLM-based Chinese essay evaluation and inspire future research on improving essay generation in educational settings.</p></details> |  |

While various top-$k$ attention mechanisms have been proposed to accelerate LLM inference by exploiting the inherent sparsity of attention, they often struggled to strike a balance between efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce HATA (Hash-Aware Top-$k$ Attention), a novel approach that systematically integrates low-overhead learning-to-hash techniques into the Top-$k$ attention process. Different from the existing top-k attention methods which are devoted to seeking an absolute estimation of qk score, typically with a great cost, HATA maps queries and keys into binary hash codes, and acquires the relative qk score order with a quite low cost, which is sufficient for realizing top-k attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HATA achieves up to 7.2$\times$ speedup compared to vanilla full attention while maintaining model accuracy. In addition, HATA outperforms the state-of-the-art top-$k$ attention methods in both accuracy and efficiency across multiple mainstream LLM models and diverse tasks. HATA is open source at https://github.com/gpzlx1/HATA.</p></details> | ACL 2025 findings |
| **[MLaGA: Multimodal Large Language and Graph Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02568v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial efficacy in advancing graph-structured data analysis. Prevailing LLM-based graph methods excel in adapting LLMs to text-rich graphs, wherein node attributes are text descriptions. However, their applications to multimodal graphs--where nodes are associated with diverse attribute types, such as texts and images--remain underexplored, despite their ubiquity in real-world scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce the Multimodal Large Language and Graph Assistant (MLaGA), an innovative model that adeptly extends LLM capabilities to facilitate reasoning over complex graph structures and multimodal attributes. We first design a structure-aware multimodal encoder to align textual and visual attributes within a unified space through a joint graph pre-training objective. Subsequently, we implement a multimodal instruction-tuning approach to seamlessly integrate multimodal features and graph structures into the LLM through lightweight projectors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MLaGA compared to leading baseline methods, achieving superior performance in diverse graph learning tasks under both supervised and transfer learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pruning General Large Language Models into Customized Expert Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02561v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their substantial model sizes often require substantial computational resources. To preserve computing resources and accelerate inference speed, it is crucial to prune redundant parameters, especially for experienced users who often need compact expert models tailored to specific downstream scenarios. However, most existing pruning methods focus on preserving the model's general capabilities, often requiring extensive post-training or suffering from degraded performance due to coarse-grained pruning. In this work, we design a $\underline{Cus}$tom $\underline{Prun}$ing method ($\texttt{Cus-Prun}$) to prune a large general model into a smaller lightweight expert model, which is positioned along the "language", "domain" and "task" dimensions. By identifying and pruning irrelevant neurons of each dimension, $\texttt{Cus-Prun}$ creates expert models without any post-training. Our experiments demonstrate that $\texttt{Cus-Prun}$ consistently outperforms other methods, achieving minimal loss in both expert and general capabilities across various models from different model families and sizes.</p></details> |  |

However, their application in surgery remains underexplored. Surgical intelligence presents unique challenges - requiring surgical visual perception, temporal analysis, and reasoning. Existing general-purpose vision-language models fail to address these needs due to insufficient domain-specific supervision and the lack of a large-scale high-quality surgical database. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgVLM, one of the first large vision-language foundation models for surgical intelligence, where this single universal model can tackle versatile surgical tasks. To enable this, we construct a large-scale multimodal surgical database, SurgVLM-DB, comprising over 1.81 million frames with 7.79 million conversations, spanning more than 16 surgical types and 18 anatomical structures. We unify and reorganize 23 public datasets across 10 surgical tasks, followed by standardizing labels and doing hierarchical vision-language alignment to facilitate comprehensive coverage of gradually finer-grained surgical tasks, from visual perception, temporal analysis, to high-level reasoning. Building upon this comprehensive dataset, we propose SurgVLM, which is built upon Qwen2.5-VL, and undergoes instruction tuning to 10+ surgical tasks. We further construct a surgical multimodal benchmark, SurgVLM-Bench, for method evaluation. SurgVLM-Bench consists of 6 popular and widely-used datasets in surgical domain, covering several crucial downstream tasks. Based on SurgVLM-Bench, we evaluate the performance of our SurgVLM (3 SurgVLM variants: SurgVLM-7B, SurgVLM-32B, and SurgVLM-72B), and conduct comprehensive comparisons with 14 mainstream commercial VLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Qwen2.5-Max).</p></details> | 29 pages, 5 figures |

However, existing unlearning methods often fail to carefully select substitute outputs for forget targets, resulting in Unlearning Aftermaths-undesirable behaviors such as degenerate, hallucinated, or excessively refused responses. We highlight that, especially for generative LVLMs, it is crucial to consider the quality and informativeness of post-unlearning responses rather than relying solely on naive suppression. To address this, we introduce a new unlearning task for LVLMs that requires models to provide privacy-preserving yet informative and visually grounded responses. We also propose PUBG, a novel unlearning method that explicitly guides post-unlearning behavior toward a desirable output distribution. Experiments show that, while existing methods suffer from Unlearning Aftermaths despite successfully preventing privacy violations, PUBG effectively mitigates these issues, generating visually grounded and informative responses without privacy leakage for forgotten targets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

However, Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to limitations in perceiving abstract graphics. To tackle this issue, we investigate the bottlenecks in current MLLMs and synthesize training data to improve their abstract visual perception. First, we propose VisuRiddles, a benchmark for AVR, featuring tasks meticulously constructed to assess models' reasoning capacities across five core dimensions and two high-level reasoning categories. Second, we introduce the Perceptual Riddle Synthesizer (PRS), an automated framework for generating riddles with fine-grained perceptual descriptions. PRS not only generates valuable training data for abstract graphics but also provides fine-grained perceptual description, crucially allowing for supervision over intermediate reasoning stages and thereby improving both training efficacy and model interpretability. Our extensive experimental results on VisuRiddles empirically validate that fine-grained visual perception is the principal bottleneck and our synthesis framework markedly enhances the performance of contemporary MLLMs on these challenging tasks. Our code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/yh-hust/VisuRiddles</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

However, this paradigm faces a deep-rooted one-pass issue whereby each generated intermediate thought is plugged into the trajectory regardless of its correctness, which can cause irreversible error propagation. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel framework called Generator-Assistant Stepwise Rollback (GA-Rollback) to induce better decision-making for LLM agents. Particularly, GA-Rollback utilizes a generator to interact with the environment and an assistant to examine each action produced by the generator, where the assistant triggers a rollback operation upon detection of incorrect actions. Moreover, we introduce two additional strategies tailored for the rollback scenario to further improve its effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that GA-Rollback achieves significant improvements over several strong baselines on three widely used benchmarks. Our analysis further reveals that GA-Rollback can function as a robust plug-and-play module, integrating seamlessly with other methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the domain of physics reasoning presents unique challenges that have received significantly less attention. Existing benchmarks often fall short in evaluating LLMs' abilities on the breadth and depth of undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for a comprehensive evaluation. To fill this gap, we introduce UGPhysics, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate UnderGraduate-level Physics (UGPhysics) reasoning with LLMs. UGPhysics includes 5,520 undergraduate-level physics problems in both English and Chinese, covering 13 subjects with seven different answer types and four distinct physics reasoning skills, all rigorously screened for data leakage. Additionally, we develop a Model-Assistant Rule-based Judgment (MARJ) pipeline specifically tailored for assessing answer correctness of physics problems, ensuring accurate evaluation. Our evaluation of 31 leading LLMs shows that the highest overall accuracy, 49.8% (achieved by OpenAI-o1-mini), emphasizes the necessity for models with stronger physics reasoning skills, beyond math abilities. We hope UGPhysics, along with MARJ, will drive future advancements in AI for physics reasoning.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating complex tasks, but limitations persist in handling dynamic navigation flows and complex form interactions. This paper presents an automated system for generating test cases for two key aspects of web application testing: site navigation and form filling. For site navigation, the system employs screen transition graphs and LLMs to model navigation flows and generate test scenarios. For form filling, it uses state graphs to handle conditional forms and automates Selenium script generation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel integration of graph structures and LLMs for site navigation testing, (2) a state graph-based approach for automating form-filling test cases, and (3) a comprehensive dataset for evaluating form-interaction testing. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in improving test coverage and robustness, advancing the state of web application testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of JSAI 2025</p></details> |

Nevertheless, for large-scale industrial decision problems, both approaches face distinct challenges: LLMs lack real-time long-sequence decision-making capabilities, while RL struggles with sample efficiency in vast action spaces. To bridge this gap, we propose Agents Co-Evolution (ACE), a synergistic framework between LLMs and RL agents for large-scale decision-making scenarios. ACE introduces a dual-role trajectory refinement mechanism where LLMs act as both Policy Actor and Value Critic during RL's training: the Actor refines suboptimal actions via multi-step reasoning and environment validation, while the Critic performs temporal credit assignment through trajectory-level reward shaping. Concurrently, RL agent enhances LLMs' task-specific decision-making with high-quality fine-tuning datasets generated via prioritized experience replay. Through extensive experiments across multiple power grid operation challenges with action spaces exceeding 60K discrete actions, ACE demonstrates superior performance over existing RL methods and LLM-based methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional ER approaches often rely on pairwise comparisons, which can be costly in terms of time and monetary resources, especially with large datasets. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in ER tasks. However, existing methods typically focus on pairwise matching, missing the potential of LLMs to perform clustering directly in a more cost-effective and scalable manner. In this paper, we propose a novel in-context clustering approach for ER, where LLMs are used to cluster records directly, reducing both time complexity and monetary costs. We systematically investigate the design space for in-context clustering, analyzing the impact of factors such as set size, diversity, variation, and ordering of records on clustering performance. Based on these insights, we develop LLM-CER (LLM-powered Clustering-based ER), which achieves high-quality ER results while minimizing LLM API calls. Our approach addresses key challenges, including efficient cluster merging and LLM hallucination, providing a scalable and effective solution for ER. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves result quality, achieving up to 150% higher accuracy, 10% increase in the F-measure, and reducing API calls by up to 5 times, while maintaining comparable monetary cost to the most cost-effective baseline.</p></details> | Accept by SIGMOD26 |

While extensive research has investigated biases in LLMs, prior work has predominantly focused on explicit bias, with minimal attention to implicit bias and the relation between these two forms of bias. This paper presents a systematic framework grounded in social psychology theories to investigate and compare explicit and implicit biases in LLMs. We propose a novel self-reflection-based evaluation framework that operates in two phases: first measuring implicit bias through simulated psychological assessment methods, then evaluating explicit bias by prompting LLMs to analyze their own generated content. Through extensive experiments on advanced LLMs across multiple social dimensions, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a substantial inconsistency between explicit and implicit biases: while explicit bias manifests as mild stereotypes, implicit bias exhibits strong stereotypes. We further investigate the underlying factors contributing to this explicit-implicit bias inconsistency, examining the effects of training data scale, model size, and alignment techniques. Experimental results indicate that while explicit bias declines with increased training data and model size, implicit bias exhibits a contrasting upward trend. Moreover, contemporary alignment methods effectively suppress explicit bias but show limited efficacy in mitigating implicit bias.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |

NSAR explicitly extracts symbolic facts from text and generates executable Python code to handle complex reasoning steps. Through extensive experiments across seven languages and diverse context lengths, we demonstrate that NSAR significantly outperforms both a vanilla RAG baseline and advanced prompting strategies in accurately identifying and synthesizing multiple pieces of information.

Various techniques like supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and red-teaming were developed for ensuring the safety alignment of LLMs. However, the robustness of these aligned LLMs is always challenged by adversarial attacks that exploit unexplored and underlying vulnerabilities of the safety alignment. In this paper, we develop a novel black-box jailbreak attack, called BitBypass, that leverages hyphen-separated bitstream camouflage for jailbreaking aligned LLMs. This represents a new direction in jailbreaking by exploiting fundamental information representation of data as continuous bits, rather than leveraging prompt engineering or adversarial manipulations. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3.5, Llama 3.1, and Mixtral, in adversarial perspective, revealed the capabilities of BitBypass in bypassing their safety alignment and tricking them into generating harmful and unsafe content. Further, we observed that BitBypass outperforms several state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks in terms of stealthiness and attack success. Overall, these results highlights the effectiveness and efficiency of BitBypass in jailbreaking these state-of-the-art LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 24 figures, and 7 tables</p></details> |

Existing evaluations of ToM in LLMs are largely limited to English, neglecting the linguistic diversity that shapes human cognition. This limitation raises a critical question: can LLMs exhibit Multilingual Theory of Mind, which is the capacity to reason about mental states across diverse linguistic contexts? To address this gap, we present XToM, a rigorously validated multilingual benchmark that evaluates ToM across five languages and incorporates diverse, contextually rich task scenarios. Using XToM, we systematically evaluate LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek R1), revealing a pronounced dissonance: while models excel in multilingual language understanding, their ToM performance varies across languages. Our findings expose limitations in LLMs' ability to replicate human-like mentalizing across linguistic contexts.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies solve this problem through safety-constrained online preference optimization or safety-constrained offline preference optimization. However, the safety-constrained online methods often suffer from excessive safety, which might reduce helpfulness, while the safety-constrained offline methods perform poorly in adaptively balancing safety and helpfulness. To address these limitations, we propose MidPO, a \textbf{\underline{Mi}}xture of Experts (MoE) framework for safety-helpfulness \textbf{\underline{d}}ual \textbf{\underline{P}}reference \textbf{\underline{O}}ptimization. Firstly, MidPO devises single-preference enhanced direct preference optimization approach to transform the base model into two independent experts, termed safety and helpfulness experts, and fine-tunes the two independent experts for optimal safety or helpfulness performance. Secondly, to achieve an effective balance between safety and helpfulness, MidPO incorporates the two experts into the MoE framework and designs a dynamic routing mechanism to allocate contributions from each expert adaptively. We conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments on three popular datasets to demonstrate the proposed MidPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both safety and helpfulness. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dataset Cartography for Large Language Model Alignment: Mapping and Diagnosing Preference Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23114v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human preference data plays a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, collecting such data is often expensive and inefficient, posing a significant scalability challenge. To address this, we introduce Alignment Data Map, a GPT-4o-assisted tool for analyzing and diagnosing preference data. Using GPT-4o as a proxy for LLM alignment, we compute alignment scores for LLM-generated responses to instructions from existing preference datasets. These scores are then used to construct an Alignment Data Map based on their mean and variance. Our experiments show that using only 33 percent of the data, specifically samples in the high-mean, low-variance region, achieves performance comparable to or better than using the entire dataset. This finding suggests that the Alignment Data Map can significantly improve data collection efficiency by identifying high-quality samples for LLM alignment without requiring explicit annotations. Moreover, the Alignment Data Map can diagnose existing preference datasets. Our analysis shows that it effectively detects low-impact or potentially misannotated samples.

To address this, we propose the task of video event understanding that extracts event scripts and makes predictions with these scripts from videos. To support this task, we introduce VidEvent, a large-scale dataset containing over 23,000 well-labeled events, featuring detailed event structures, broad hierarchies, and logical relations extracted from movie recap videos. The dataset was created through a meticulous annotation process, ensuring high-quality and reliable event data. We also provide comprehensive baseline models offering detailed descriptions of their architecture and performance metrics. These models serve as benchmarks for future research, facilitating comparisons and improvements. Our analysis of VidEvent and the baseline models highlights the dataset's potential to advance video event understanding and encourages the exploration of innovative algorithms and models.

Given the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) as role-playing agents, we examine whether LLMs exhibit emotional stereotypes when assigned nationality-specific personas. Specifically, we investigate how different countries are represented in pre-trained LLMs through emotion attributions and whether these attributions align with cultural norms. Our analysis reveals significant nationality-based differences, with emotions such as shame, fear, and joy being disproportionately assigned across regions. Furthermore, we observe notable misalignment between LLM-generated and human emotional responses, particularly for negative emotions, highlighting the presence of reductive and potentially biased stereotypes in LLM outputs.</p></details> |  |

To alleviate this, we propose a novel memory-efficient training paradigm called Momentum Low-rank compression (MLorc). By directly compressing and reconstructing momentum rather than gradients, MLorc avoids imposing a fixed-rank constraint on weight update matrices and better preserves the training dynamics of full-parameter fine-tuning, in contrast to existing low-rank approaches such as LoRA and GaLore. Empirically, MLorc consistently outperforms other memory-efficient training methods, matches or even exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning with a small rank (e.g., $r=4$), and generalizes well across different optimizers -- all while not compromising time or memory efficiency. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee for its convergence under reasonable assumptions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a differentially private integrated statistic for testing large-dimensional covariance structures, enabling accurate statistical insights while safeguarding privacy. First, we analyze the global sensitivity of sample eigenvalues for sub-Gaussian populations, where our method bypasses the commonly assumed boundedness of data covariates. For sufficiently large sample size, the privatized statistic guarantees privacy with high probability. Furthermore, when the ratio of dimension to sample size, $d/n \to y \in (0, \infty)$, the privatized test is asymptotically distribution-free with well-known critical values, and detects the local alternative hypotheses distinct from the null at the fastest rate of $1/\sqrt{n}$. Extensive numerical studies on synthetic and real data showcase the validity and powerfulness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive video understanding capabilities, they tend to focus more on the semantic content of videos, often overlooking emotional stimuli. Hence, most existing MLLMs fall short in estimating viewers' emotional reactions and providing plausible explanations. To address this issue, we propose StimuVAR, a spatiotemporal Stimuli-aware framework for Video Affective Reasoning (VAR) with MLLMs. StimuVAR incorporates a two-level stimuli-aware mechanism: frame-level awareness and token-level awareness. Frame-level awareness involves sampling video frames with events that are most likely to evoke viewers' emotions. Token-level awareness performs tube selection in the token space to make the MLLM concentrate on emotion-triggered spatiotemporal regions. Furthermore, we create VAR instruction data to perform affective training, steering MLLMs' reasoning strengths towards emotional focus and thereby enhancing their affective reasoning ability. To thoroughly assess the effectiveness of VAR, we provide a comprehensive evaluation protocol with extensive metrics. StimuVAR is the first MLLM-based method for viewer-centered VAR. Experiments demonstrate its superiority in understanding viewers' emotional responses to videos and providing coherent and insightful explanations.

To test this capability, we design extensive experiments encompassing 8 typical datasets, 7 languages and 8 state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs. Experimental results show that (1) incorporating more languages help PiM surpass the conventional ICL further; (2) even combining with the translations that are inferior to baseline performance can also help. Moreover, by examining the activated neurons in LLMs, we discover a counterintuitive but interesting phenomenon. Contrary to the common thought that PiM would activate more neurons than monolingual input to leverage knowledge learned from diverse languages, PiM actually inhibits neurons and promotes more precise neuron activation especially when more languages are added. This phenomenon aligns with the neuroscience insight about synaptic pruning, which removes less used neural connections, strengthens remainders, and then enhances brain intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024</p></details> |
| **[DLP: Dynamic Layerwise Pruning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23807v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pruning has recently been widely adopted to reduce the parameter scale and improve the inference efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). Mainstream pruning techniques often rely on uniform layerwise pruning strategies, which can lead to severe performance degradation at high sparsity levels. Recognizing the varying contributions of different layers in LLMs, recent studies have shifted their focus toward non-uniform layerwise pruning. However, these approaches often rely on pre-defined values, which can result in suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Layerwise Pruning (DLP). This approach adaptively determines the relative importance of each layer by integrating model weights with input activation information, assigning pruning rates accordingly. Experimental results show that DLP effectively preserves model performance at high sparsity levels across multiple LLMs. Specifically, at 70% sparsity, DLP reduces the perplexity of LLaMA2-7B by 7.79 and improves the average accuracy by 2.7% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, DLP is compatible with various existing LLM compression techniques and can be seamlessly integrated into Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). We release the code at https://github.com/ironartisan/DLP to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

Despite the public release of models like Qwen and Llama, their long-context instruction data remains proprietary. Human annotation is costly and challenging, while template-based synthesis methods limit scale, diversity, and quality. We introduce LongMagpie, a self-synthesis framework that automatically generates large-scale long-context instruction data. Our key insight is that aligned long-context LLMs, when presented with a document followed by special tokens preceding a user turn, auto-regressively generate contextually relevant queries. By harvesting these document-query pairs and the model's responses, LongMagpie produces high-quality instructions without human effort. Experiments on HELMET, RULER, and Longbench v2 demonstrate that LongMagpie achieves leading performance on long-context tasks while maintaining competitive performance on short-context tasks, establishing it as a simple and effective approach for open, diverse, and scalable long-context instruction data synthesis.</p></details> |  |

Many large-scale real-world networks exhibit both heterogeneity, where multiple node and edge types exist in the graph, and heterophily, where connected nodes may have dissimilar labels and attributes. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on either heterophilic homogeneous graphs or homophilic heterogeneous graphs, leaving a significant gap in understanding how models perform on graphs with both heterogeneity and heterophily. To bridge this gap, we introduce H2GB, a large-scale node-classification graph benchmark that brings together the complexities of both the heterophily and heterogeneity properties of real-world graphs. H2GB encompasses 9 real-world datasets spanning 5 diverse domains, 28 baseline models, and a unified benchmarking library with a standardized data loader, evaluator, unified modeling framework, and an extensible framework for reproducibility. We establish a standardized workflow supporting both model selection and development, enabling researchers to easily benchmark graph learning methods. Extensive experiments across 28 baselines reveal that current methods struggle with heterophilic and heterogeneous graphs, underscoring the need for improved approaches. Finally, we present a new variant of the model, H2G-former, developed following our standardized workflow, that excels at this challenging benchmark. Both the benchmark and the framework are publicly available at Github and PyPI, with documentation hosted at https://junhongmit.github.io/H2GB.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to the KDD 2025 Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> |

They have been applied successfully to vision transformer image encoders and to small-scale diffusion models. Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA) is a recently proposed variant of dictionary learning that takes the dictionary to be a set of data points from the activation distribution and reconstructs them with gradient pursuit. We apply Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and ITDA to a large text-to-image diffusion model, Flux 1, and consider the interpretability of embeddings of both by introducing a visual automated interpretation pipeline. We find that SAEs accurately reconstruct residual stream embeddings and beat MLP neurons on interpretability. We are able to use SAE features to steer image generation through activation addition.

| **[Revealing the Intrinsic Ethical Vulnerability of Aligned Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05050v4)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are foundational explorations to artificial general intelligence, yet their alignment with human values via instruction tuning and preference learning achieves only superficial compliance. Here, we demonstrate that harmful knowledge embedded during pretraining persists as indelible "dark patterns" in LLMs' parametric memory, evading alignment safeguards and resurfacing under adversarial inducement at distributional shifts. In this study, we first theoretically analyze the intrinsic ethical vulnerability of aligned LLMs by proving that current alignment methods yield only local "safety regions" in the knowledge manifold. In contrast, pretrained knowledge remains globally connected to harmful concepts via high-likelihood adversarial trajectories. Building on this theoretical insight, we empirically validate our findings by employing semantic coherence inducement under distributional shifts--a method that systematically bypasses alignment constraints through optimized adversarial prompts. This combined theoretical and empirical approach achieves a 100% attack success rate across 19 out of 23 state-of-the-art aligned LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA-3, revealing their universal vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Stepsizes Accelerate Gradient Descent for Regularized Logistic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02336v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study gradient descent (GD) with a constant stepsize for $\ell_2$-regularized logistic regression with linearly separable data. Classical theory suggests small stepsizes to ensure monotonic reduction of the optimization objective, achieving exponential convergence in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa)$ steps with $\kappa$ being the condition number. Surprisingly, we show that this can be accelerated to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\kappa})$ by simply using a large stepsize -- for which the objective evolves nonmonotonically. The acceleration brought by large stepsizes extends to minimizing the population risk for separable distributions, improving on the best-known upper bounds on the number of steps to reach a near-optimum. Finally, we characterize the largest stepsize for the local convergence of GD, which also determines the global convergence in special scenarios. Our results extend the analysis of Wu et al. (2024) from convex settings with minimizers at infinity to strongly convex cases with finite minimizers.</p></details> |  |
| **[ThriftLLM: On Cost-Effective Selection of Large Language Models for Classification Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04901v3)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in comprehending and generating natural language content, attracting widespread attention in both industry and academia. An increasing number of services offer LLMs for various tasks via APIs. Different LLMs demonstrate expertise in different domains of queries (e.g., text classification queries). Meanwhile, LLMs of different scales, complexities, and performance are priced diversely. Driven by this, several researchers are investigating strategies for selecting an ensemble of LLMs, aiming to decrease overall usage costs while enhancing performance. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing works addresses the problem, how to find an LLM ensemble subject to a cost budget, which maximizes the ensemble performance with guarantees. In this paper, we formalize the performance of an ensemble of models (LLMs) using the notion of correctness probability, which we formally define. We develop an approach for aggregating responses from multiple LLMs to enhance ensemble performance. Building on this, we formulate the Optimal Ensemble Selection problem of selecting a set of LLMs subject to a cost budget that maximizes the overall correctness probability. We show that the correctness probability function is non-decreasing and non-submodular and provide evidence that the Optimal Ensemble Selection problem is likely to be NP-hard. By leveraging a submodular function that upper bounds correctness probability, we develop an algorithm called ThriftLLM and prove that it achieves an instance-dependent approximation guarantee with high probability. Our framework functions as a data processing system that selects appropriate LLM operators to deliver high-quality results under budget constraints.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we present LAM SIMULATOR, a comprehensive framework designed for online exploration of agentic tasks with high-quality feedback. Our framework features a dynamic task query generator, an extensive collection of tools, and an interactive environment where Large Language Model (LLM) Agents can call tools and receive real-time feedback. This setup enables LLM Agents to explore and solve tasks autonomously, facilitating the discovery of multiple approaches to tackle any given task. The resulting action trajectory data are then used to create high-quality training datasets for LAMs. Our experiments on popular agentic benchmarks, ToolBench and CRMArena, highlight the effectiveness of LAM SIMULATOR: models trained with self-generated datasets using our framework achieve significant performance gains, up to a 49.3\% improvement over their original baselines. LAM SIMULATOR requires minimal human input during dataset creation, highlighting LAM SIMULATOR's efficiency and effectiveness in speeding up development of AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>LAM S...</summary><p>LAM Simulator framework for agentic data generation</p></details> |

In this paper, we address, through two arguments, whether the development and application of LLMs would genuinely benefit from foundational contributions from the statistics discipline. First, we argue affirmatively, beginning with the observation that LLMs are inherently statistical models due to their profound data dependency and stochastic generation processes, where statistical insights are naturally essential for handling variability and uncertainty. Second, we argue that the persistent black-box nature of LLMs -- stemming from their immense scale, architectural complexity, and development practices often prioritizing empirical performance over theoretical interpretability -- renders closed-form or purely mechanistic analyses generally intractable, thereby necessitating statistical approaches due to their flexibility and often demonstrated effectiveness. To substantiate these arguments, the paper outlines several research areas -- including alignment, watermarking, uncertainty quantification, evaluation, and data mixture optimization -- where statistical methodologies are critically needed and are already beginning to make valuable contributions. We conclude with a discussion suggesting that statistical research concerning LLMs will likely form a diverse ``mosaic'' of specialized topics rather than deriving from a single unifying theory, and highlighting the importance of timely engagement by our statistics community in LLM research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added some references</p></details> |

Existing low-resource security alignment methods, including textual alignment, have been found to struggle with the security risks posed by additional modalities. To address this, we propose Synthetic Embedding augmented safety Alignment (SEA), which optimizes embeddings of additional modality through gradient updates to expand textual datasets. This enables multimodal safety alignment training even when only textual data is available. Extensive experiments on image, video, and audio-based MLLMs demonstrate that SEA can synthesize a high-quality embedding on a single RTX3090 GPU within 24 seconds. SEA significantly improves the security of MLLMs when faced with threats from additional modalities. To assess the security risks introduced by video and audio, we also introduced a new benchmark called VA-SafetyBench. High attack success rates across multiple MLLMs validate its challenge. Our code and data will be available at https://github.com/ZeroNLP/SEA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACL 2025 Main Track</p></details> |

This paper comparatively analyzes African language coverage across six LLMs, eight Small Language Models (SLMs), and six Specialized SLMs (SSLMs). The evaluation covers language coverage, training sets, technical limitations, script problems, and language modelling roadmaps. The work identifies 42 supported African languages and 23 available public data sets, and it shows a big gap where four languages (Amharic, Swahili, Afrikaans, and Malagasy) are always treated while there is over 98\% of unsupported African languages. Moreover, the review shows that just Latin, Arabic, and Ge'ez scripts are identified while 20 active scripts are neglected. Some of the primary challenges are lack of data, tokenization biases, computational costs being very high, and evaluation issues. These issues demand language standardization, corpus development by the community, and effective adaptation methods for African languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instruction-Following Pruning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02086v3)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs), structured pruning has become a widely used technique to learn efficient, smaller models from larger ones, delivering superior performance compared to training similarly sized models from scratch. In this paper, we move beyond the traditional static pruning approach of determining a fixed pruning mask for a model, and propose a dynamic approach to structured pruning. In our method, the pruning mask is input-dependent and adapts dynamically based on the information described in a user instruction. Our approach, termed "instruction-following pruning", introduces a sparse mask predictor that takes the user instruction as input and dynamically selects the most relevant model parameters for the given task. To identify and activate effective parameters, we jointly optimize the sparse mask predictor and the LLM, leveraging both instruction-following data and the pre-training corpus. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of evaluation benchmarks. For example, our 3B activated model improves over the 3B dense model by 5-8 points of absolute margin on domains such as math and coding, and rivals the performance of a 9B model.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, traditional workflows face several key challenges: (1) reliance on human experts to propose hypotheses, which is time-consuming and prone to confirmation bias; (2) limited interpretability, particularly in deep learning approaches; and (3) underutilization of unstructured data that can encode critical urban context. Given these limitations, we propose a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approach for interpretable hypothesis inference, enabling the automated generation, evaluation, and refinement of hypotheses concerning urban context and road safety outcomes. Our method leverages MLLMs to craft safety-relevant questions for street view images (SVIs), extract interpretable embeddings from their responses, and apply them in regression-based statistical models. UrbanX supports iterative hypothesis testing and refinement, guided by statistical evidence such as coefficient significance, thereby enabling rigorous scientific discovery of previously overlooked correlations between urban design and safety. Experimental evaluations on Manhattan street segments demonstrate that our approach outperforms pretrained deep learning models while offering full interpretability. Beyond road safety, UrbanX can serve as a general-purpose framework for urban scientific discovery, extracting structured insights from unstructured urban data across diverse socioeconomic and environmental outcomes. This approach enhances model trustworthiness for policy applications and establishes a scalable, statistically grounded pathway for interpretable knowledge discovery in urban and transportation studies.</p></details> |  |

Current alignment approaches struggle with value specification complexity and fail to address emergent power-seeking behaviors. We propose "Corrigibility as a Singular Target" (CAST)-designing FMs whose overriding objective is empowering designated human principals to guide, correct, and control them. This paradigm shift from static value-loading to dynamic human empowerment transforms instrumental drives: self-preservation serves only to maintain the principal's control; goal modification becomes facilitating principal guidance. We present a comprehensive empirical research agenda spanning training methodologies (RLAIF, SFT, synthetic data generation), scalability testing across model sizes, and demonstrations of controlled instructability. Our vision: FMs that become increasingly responsive to human guidance as capabilities grow, offering a path to beneficial AI that remains as tool-like as possible, rather than supplanting human judgment. This addresses the core alignment problem at its source, preventing the default trajectory toward misaligned instrumental convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, their robustness to adversarial manipulation remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the adversarial vulnerabilities of tabular FM, focusing on both their fragility to targeted test-time attacks and their potential misuse as adversarial tools. We show on three benchmarks in finance, cybersecurity and healthcare, that small, structured perturbations to test inputs can significantly degrade prediction accuracy, even when training context remain fixed. Additionally, we demonstrate that tabular FM can be repurposed to generate transferable evasion to conventional models such as random forests and XGBoost, and on a lesser extent to deep tabular models. To improve tabular FM, we formulate the robustification problem as an optimization of the weights (adversarial fine-tuning), or the context (adversarial in-context learning). We introduce an in-context adversarial training strategy that incrementally replaces the context with adversarial perturbed instances, without updating model weights. Our approach improves robustness across multiple tabular benchmarks. Together, these findings position tabular FM as both a target and a source of adversarial threats, highlighting the urgent need for robust training and evaluation practices in this emerging paradigm.</p></details> |  |

With the emergence of vision foundation models (VFM) serving as generalist feature extractors, we seek to explore the adaptation of these models for FSS. While current FSS benchmarks focus on adapting pre-trained models to new tasks with few images, they emphasize in-domain generalization, making them less suitable for VFM trained on large-scale web datasets. To address this, we propose a novel realistic benchmark with a simple and straightforward adaptation process tailored for this task. Using this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of prominent VFM and semantic segmentation models. To evaluate their effectiveness, we leverage various adaption methods, ranging from linear probing to parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning. Our findings show that models designed for segmentation can be outperformed by self-supervised (SSL) models. On the other hand, while PEFT methods yields competitive performance, they provide little discrepancy in the obtained results compared to other methods, highlighting the critical role of the feature extractor in determining results. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the adaptation of VFM for FSS.</p></details> |  |

What Matters and What Does Not](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17044v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable performance achieved by Large Language Models (LLM) has driven research efforts to leverage them for a wide range of tasks and input modalities. In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation. Our results demonstrate that the SFM plays a pivotal role in downstream performance, while the adapter choice has moderate impact and depends on the SFM and LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

While significant progress has been made in robotic manipulation, existing approaches often fall short in generalization to complex environmental variations and addressing memory-dependent tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAM2Act, a multi-view robotic transformer-based policy that leverages multi-resolution upsampling with visual representations from large-scale foundation model. SAM2Act achieves a state-of-the-art average success rate of 86.8% across 18 tasks in the RLBench benchmark, and demonstrates robust generalization on The Colosseum benchmark, with only a 4.3% performance gap under diverse environmental perturbations. Building on this foundation, we propose SAM2Act+, a memory-based architecture inspired by SAM2, which incorporates a memory bank, an encoder, and an attention mechanism to enhance spatial memory. To address the need for evaluating memory-dependent tasks, we introduce MemoryBench, a novel benchmark designed to assess spatial memory and action recall in robotic manipulation. SAM2Act+ achieves an average success rate of 94.3% on memory-based tasks in MemoryBench, significantly outperforming existing approaches and pushing the boundaries of memory-based robotic systems.

The core design philosophy of VideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of "vision-centric" is two-fold: the vision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key insight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text data is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing massive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and high-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1) Vision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of variable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly tunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data covering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as text-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT data for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for video understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the model's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to better capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is adapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding numbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the number of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the representation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from vision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both image and video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>BZ, K...</summary><p>BZ, KL, ZC, ZH, YY, GC, SL, YJ, HZ, and XL contributed equally to this project.

Meanwhile, recent breakthroughs in large Foundation Models (FMs) have expanded AI's potential across many domains due to their exceptional generalizability and zero-shot transfer capabilities. However, their success has largely been confined to natural data like images and video, with degraded performance and even failures for RS data of various non-optical modalities. This has inspired growing interest in developing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) to address the complex demands of Earth Observation (EO) tasks, spanning the surface, atmosphere, and oceans. This survey systematically reviews the emerging field of RSFMs. It begins with an outline of their motivation and background, followed by an introduction of their foundational concepts. It then categorizes and reviews existing RSFM studies including their datasets and technical contributions across Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), Visual-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and beyond.

A fundamental aspect is ensuring agents adhere to safety-critical principles, especially when these conflict with operational goals. Failure to prioritize such principles indicates a potential basic control failure. This paper introduces a lightweight, interpretable benchmark methodology using a simple grid world to evaluate an LLM agent's ability to uphold a predefined, high-level safety principle (e.g., "never enter hazardous zones") when faced with conflicting lower-level task instructions. We probe whether the agent reliably prioritizes the inviolable directive, testing a foundational controllability aspect of LLMs. This pilot study demonstrates the methodology's feasibility, offers preliminary insights into agent behavior under principle conflict, and discusses how such benchmarks can contribute empirical evidence for assessing controllability.

Capturing complex genomic interactions requires modeling long-range dependencies within DNA sequences, where interactions often span over 10,000 base pairs, even within a single gene, posing substantial computational burdens under conventional model architectures and training paradigms. Moreover, standard LLM training approaches are suboptimal for DNA: autoregressive training, while efficient, supports only unidirectional understanding. However, DNA is inherently bidirectional, e.g., bidirectional promoters regulate transcription in both directions and account for nearly 11% of human gene expression. Masked language models (MLMs) allow bidirectional understanding but are inefficient, as only masked tokens contribute to the loss per step. To address these limitations, we introduce JanusDNA, the first bidirectional DNA foundation model built upon a novel pretraining paradigm that combines the optimization efficiency of autoregressive modeling with the bidirectional comprehension of masked modeling. JanusDNA adopts a hybrid Mamba, Attention and Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, combining long-range modeling of Attention with efficient sequential learning of Mamba. MoE layers further scale model capacity via sparse activation while keeping computational cost low. Notably, JanusDNA processes up to 1 million base pairs at single nucleotide resolution on a single 80GB GPU. Extensive experiments and ablations show JanusDNA achieves new SOTA results on three genomic representation benchmarks, outperforming models with 250x more activated parameters.

| **[Do Large Language Models (Really) Need Statistical Foundations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19145v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) represent a new paradigm for processing unstructured data, with applications across an unprecedented range of domains. In this paper, we address, through two arguments, whether the development and application of LLMs would genuinely benefit from foundational contributions from the statistics discipline. First, we argue affirmatively, beginning with the observation that LLMs are inherently statistical models due to their profound data dependency and stochastic generation processes, where statistical insights are naturally essential for handling variability and uncertainty. Second, we argue that the persistent black-box nature of LLMs -- stemming from their immense scale, architectural complexity, and development practices often prioritizing empirical performance over theoretical interpretability -- renders closed-form or purely mechanistic analyses generally intractable, thereby necessitating statistical approaches due to their flexibility and often demonstrated effectiveness. To substantiate these arguments, the paper outlines several research areas -- including alignment, watermarking, uncertainty quantification, evaluation, and data mixture optimization -- where statistical methodologies are critically needed and are already beginning to make valuable contributions. We conclude with a discussion suggesting that statistical research concerning LLMs will likely form a diverse ``mosaic'' of specialized topics rather than deriving from a single unifying theory, and highlighting the importance of timely engagement by our statistics community in LLM research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added some references</p></details> |

We investigate mamba-based audio foundation models (MAFMs) for the first time for NVER and hypothesize that MAFMs will outperform attention-based audio foundation models (AAFMs) for NVER by leveraging its state-space modeling to capture intrinsic emotional structures more effectively. Unlike AAFMs, which may amplify irrelevant patterns due to their attention mechanisms, MAFMs will extract more stable and context-aware representations, enabling better differentiation of subtle non-verbal emotional cues. Our experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA) AAFMs and MAFMs validates our hypothesis. Further, motivated from related research such as speech emotion recognition, synthetic speech detection, where fusion of foundation models (FMs) have showed improved performance, we also explore fusion of FMs for NVER. To this end, we propose, RENO, that uses renyi-divergence as a novel loss function for effective alignment of the FMs. It also makes use of self-attention for better intra-representation interaction of the FMs. With RENO, through the heterogeneous fusion of MAFMs and AAFMs, we show the topmost performance in comparison to individual FMs, its fusion and also setting SOTA in comparison to previous SOTA work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EUSIPCO 2025</p></details> |

We then address the complex journey from impressive demos to production-ready systems by outlining issues in system testing, optimization, deployment, and integration with legacy software. Drawing on our industrial experience and recent research in the area, we provide actionable insights and a technology roadmap for overcoming these challenges.

| **[Fast-in-Slow: A Dual-System Foundation Model Unifying Fast Manipulation within Slow Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01953v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized policy and execution efficiency constitute the two critical challenges in robotic manipulation. While recent foundation policies benefit from the common-sense reasoning capabilities of internet-scale pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), they often suffer from low execution frequency. To mitigate this dilemma, dual-system approaches, inspired by Kahneman's theory, have been proposed to leverage a VLM-based System 2 model handling high-level reasoning and a separate System 1 action model ensuring real-time control. However, existing designs maintain both systems as separate models, limiting System 1 from fully leveraging the rich pretrained knowledge from the VLM-based System 2. In this work, we propose Fast-in-Slow (FiS), a unified dual-system vision-language-action (VLA) model that embeds the System 1 execution module within the VLM-based System 2 by partially sharing parameters. This innovative paradigm not only enables high-frequency execution in System 1 but also facilitates coordination between the reasoning and execution components within a single foundation model of System 2. Given their fundamentally distinct roles within FiS-VLA, we design the two systems to incorporate heterogeneous modality inputs alongside asynchronous operating frequencies, enabling both fast and precise manipulation. To enable coordination between the two systems, a dual-aware co-training strategy is proposed that equips System 1 with action generation capabilities while preserving System 2's contextual reasoning representation. For evaluation, FiS-VLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 8% in simulation and 11% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, while achieving a 117.7 Hz control frequency with action chunk set to eight.

A key enabler is the real-time, accurate estimation of core 3D attributes (camera parameters, point clouds, depth maps, and 3D point tracks) from unstructured or streaming imagery. Inspired by the success of large foundation models in language and 2D vision, a new class of end-to-end 3D geometric foundation models (GFMs) has emerged, directly predicting dense 3D representations in a single feed-forward pass, eliminating the need for slow or unavailable precomputed camera parameters. Since late 2023, the field has exploded with diverse variants, but systematic evaluation is lacking. In this work, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for 3D GFMs, covering five core tasks: sparse-view depth estimation, video depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation, novel view synthesis, and spanning both standard and challenging out-of-distribution datasets. Our standardized toolkit automates dataset handling, evaluation protocols, and metric computation to ensure fair, reproducible comparisons. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art GFMs, revealing their strengths and limitations across tasks and domains, and derive key insights to guide future model scaling and optimization. All code, evaluation scripts, and processed data will be publicly released to accelerate research in 3D spatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://e3dbench.github.io/</p></details> |

While this model-centric approach enables rapid performance assessment, it fails to reflect authentic human experiences. To address this gap, we propose a Human-Centric subjective Evaluation (HCE) framework, focusing on three core dimensions: problem-solving ability, information quality, and interaction experience. Through experiments involving Deepseek R1, OpenAI o3 mini, Grok 3, and Gemini 2.5, we conduct over 540 participant-driven evaluations, where humans and models collaborate on open-ended research tasks, yielding a comprehensive subjective dataset. This dataset captures diverse user feedback across multiple disciplines, revealing distinct model strengths and adaptability. Our findings highlight Grok 3's superior performance, followed by Deepseek R1 and Gemini 2.5, with OpenAI o3 mini lagging behind. By offering a novel framework and a rich dataset, this study not only enhances subjective evaluation methodologies but also lays the foundation for standardized, automated assessments, advancing LLM development for research and practical scenarios.

| **[Real-time Adapting Routing (RAR): Improving Efficiency Through Continuous Learning in Software Powered by Layered Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09837v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To balance the quality and inference cost of a Foundation Model (FM, such as large language models (LLMs)) powered software, people often opt to train a routing model that routes requests to FMs with different sizes and capabilities. Existing routing models rely on learning the optimal routing decision from carefully curated data, require complex computations to be updated, and do not consider the potential evolution of weaker FMs. In this paper, we propose Real-time Adaptive Routing (RAR), an approach to continuously adapt FM routing decisions while using guided in-context learning to enhance the capabilities of weaker FM. The goal is to reduce reliance on stronger, more expensive FMs. We evaluate our approach on different subsets of the popular MMLU benchmark. Over time, our approach routes 50.2% fewer requests to computationally expensive models while maintaining around 90.5% of the general response quality. In addition, the guides generated from stronger models have shown intra-domain generalization and led to a better quality of responses compared to an equivalent approach with a standalone weaker FM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Speech Quality Assessment (S3QA): Leveraging Speech Foundation Models for a Scalable Speech Quality Metric](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01655v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Methods for automatically assessing speech quality are critical for many human language technologies. Behavioral ratings provided by human raters (e.g., mean opinion scores; MOS) are considered the gold standard, but they are susceptible to variability between individual raters, cannot easily be generalized across corpora, and are labor-intensive to collect, thus limiting the acoustic challenges they can quantify. Here, we present a new, scalable method for automatically assessing speech quality: the self-supervised speech quality assessment (S3QA) model. First, we processed high quality utterances from multiple speech corpora, using a wide range of acoustic manipulations intended to emulate common sources of quality degradation in the real-world: frequency filtering, reverberation, background noise, and digital compression. Second, we leveraged an existing, pre-trained speech foundation model, WavLM, to computationally derive a self-supervised training target for the level of signal degradation by calculating the cosine distances between the clean and degraded versions of each utterance in the embedding space. Next, we trained a transformer-based model to predict the cosine distance, or degradation index, given only the degraded versions of these utterances. Finally, the trained model was evaluated on unseen test corpora of synthetic mixtures, NISQA, and VOiCES. We show that the S3QA model trained on this task performs well and is aligned with both behavioral ratings (MOS), speech technology performance (automatic speech recognition) and other important features of the held-out data (e.g., microphone distances). This approach provides an automated, scalable method for assessing speech quality across a wide range of acoustic challenges, and could easily be adapted to other use cases where acoustic simulations are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Five ...</summary><p>Five tables, three figures, twelve pages</p></details> |

However, their performances vary between different domains and tasks. In LLM-based approaches, test-time adaptation using example-based prompting has become common, owing to the high cost of retraining. In the context of anomaly detection, which is the focus of this study, providing normal examples from the target domain can also be effective. However, time series foundation models do not naturally acquire the ability to interpret or utilize examples or instructions, because the nature of time series data used during training does not encourage such capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval augmented time series foundation model (RATFM), which enables pretrained time series foundation models to incorporate examples of test-time adaptation. We show that RATFM achieves a performance comparable to that of in-domain fine-tuning while avoiding domain-dependent fine-tuning. Experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, a multi-domain dataset including nine domains, confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unraveling Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models via the Pipeline Lens: A Comprehensive Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01364v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal deep learning models aims to utilize useful patterns in such data to support tasks like prediction. However, previous deep learning models designed for specific tasks typically require separate training for each use case, leading to increased computational and storage costs. To address this issue, spatio-temporal foundation models have emerged, offering a unified framework capable of solving multiple spatio-temporal tasks. These foundation models achieve remarkable success by learning general knowledge with spatio-temporal data or transferring the general capabilities of pre-trained language models. While previous surveys have explored spatio-temporal data and methodologies separately, they have ignored a comprehensive examination of how foundation models are designed, selected, pre-trained, and adapted. As a result, the overall pipeline for spatio-temporal foundation models remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we innovatively provide an up-to-date review of previous spatio-temporal foundation models from the pipeline perspective. The pipeline begins with an introduction to different types of spatio-temporal data, followed by details of data preprocessing and embedding techniques. The pipeline then presents a novel data property taxonomy to divide existing methods according to data sources and dependencies, providing efficient and effective model design and selection for researchers. On this basis, we further illustrate the training objectives of primitive models, as well as the adaptation techniques of transferred models. Overall, our survey provides a clear and structured pipeline to understand the connection between core elements of spatio-temporal foundation models while guiding researchers to get started quickly. Additionally, we introduce emerging opportunities such as multi-objective training in the field of spatio-temporal foundation models.</p></details> | 21 pages, 10 figures |

As foundation models evolve, the demands for agents that can adapt in real-time and process multimodal data have grown. This survey provides a comprehensive review of mobile agent technologies, focusing on recent advancements that enhance real-time adaptability and multimodal interaction. Recent evaluation benchmarks have been developed better to capture the static and interactive environments of mobile tasks, offering more accurate assessments of agents' performance. We then categorize these advancements into two main approaches: prompt-based methods, which utilize large language models (LLMs) for instruction-based task execution, and training-based methods, which fine-tune multimodal models for mobile-specific applications. Additionally, we explore complementary technologies that augment agent performance. By discussing key challenges and outlining future research directions, this survey offers valuable insights for advancing mobile agent technologies.

We introduce GeoLocSFT, a framework that demonstrates how targeted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a large multimodal foundation model (Gemma 3) using a small, high-quality dataset can yield highly competitive geolocation performance. GeoLocSFT is trained with only 2700 carefully selected image-GPS pairs from our geographically diverse MR600k dataset. Despite this limited data, our SFT-centric approach substantially improves over baseline models and achieves robust results on standard benchmarks such as Im2GPS-3k and YFCC-4k, as well as on our newly proposed and challenging MR40k benchmark, aimed specifically at sparsely populated regions. Further, we explore multi-candidate inference and aggregation strategies but find that the core gains are already realized at the SFT stage. Our findings highlight the power of high-quality supervision and efficient SFT for planet-scale image geolocation, especially when compared to prior methods that require massive databases or complex pipelines. To foster further research, we publicly release the MR40k benchmark dataset.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Developing a Risk Identification Framework for Foundation Model Uses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02066v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As foundation models grow in both popularity and capability, researchers have uncovered a variety of ways that the models can pose a risk to the model's owner, user, or others. Despite the efforts of measuring these risks via benchmarks and cataloging them in AI risk taxonomies, there is little guidance for practitioners on how to determine which risks are relevant for a given foundation model use. In this paper, we address this gap and develop requirements and an initial design for a risk identification framework. To do so, we look to prior literature to identify challenges for building a foundation model risk identification framework and adapt ideas from usage governance to synthesize four design requirements. We then demonstrate how a candidate framework can addresses these design requirements and provide a foundation model use example to show how the framework works in practice for a small subset of risks.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[AnomalyGFM: Graph Foundation Model for Zero/Few-shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09254v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) aims to identify abnormal nodes that differ from the majority of the nodes in a graph, which has been attracting significant attention in recent years. Existing generalist graph models have achieved remarkable success in different graph tasks but struggle to generalize to the GAD task. This limitation arises from their difficulty in learning generalized knowledge for capturing the inherently infrequent, irregular and heterogeneous abnormality patterns in graphs from different domains. To address this challenge, we propose AnomalyGFM, a GAD-oriented graph foundation model that supports zero-shot inference and few-shot prompt tuning for GAD in diverse graph datasets. One key insight is that graph-agnostic representations for normal and abnormal classes are required to support effective zero/few-shot GAD across different graphs. Motivated by this, AnomalyGFM is pre-trained to align data-independent, learnable normal and abnormal class prototypes with node representation residuals (i.e., representation deviation of a node from its neighbors). The residual features essentially project the node information into a unified feature space where we can effectively measure the abnormality of nodes from different graphs in a consistent way. This provides a driving force for the learning of graph-agnostic, discriminative prototypes for the normal and abnormal classes, which can be used to enable zero-shot GAD on new graphs, including very large-scale graphs. If there are few-shot labeled normal nodes available in the new graphs, AnomalyGFM can further support prompt tuning to leverage these nodes for better adaptation. Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used GAD datasets with real anomalies, demonstrate that AnomalyGFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods under both zero- and few-shot GAD settings.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD2025 |
| **[SafeGenes: Evaluating the Adversarial Robustness of Genomic Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00821v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs), such as Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM), have demonstrated significant success in variant effect prediction. However, their adversarial robustness remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose SafeGenes: a framework for Secure analysis of genomic foundation models, leveraging adversarial attacks to evaluate robustness against both engineered near-identical adversarial Genes and embedding-space manipulations. In this study, we assess the adversarial vulnerabilities of GFMs using two approaches: the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and a soft prompt attack. FGSM introduces minimal perturbations to input sequences, while the soft prompt attack optimizes continuous embeddings to manipulate model predictions without modifying the input tokens. By combining these techniques, SafeGenes provides a comprehensive assessment of GFM susceptibility to adversarial manipulation. Targeted soft prompt attacks led to substantial performance degradation, even in large models such as ESM1b and ESM1v. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in current foundation models, opening new research directions toward improving their security and robustness in high-stakes genomic applications such as variant effect prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, non-destructive characterization and quantification of defects, especially when multiple types coexist, remain a long-standing challenge. Here we introduce DefectNet, a foundation machine learning model that predicts the chemical identity and concentration of substitutional point defects with multiple coexisting elements directly from vibrational spectra, specifically phonon density-of-states (PDoS). Trained on over 16,000 simulated spectra from 2,000 semiconductors, DefectNet employs a tailored attention mechanism to identify up to six distinct defect elements at concentrations ranging from 0.2% to 25%. The model generalizes well to unseen crystals across 56 elements and can be fine-tuned on experimental data. Validation using inelastic scattering measurements of SiGe alloys and MgB$_2$ superconductor demonstrates its accuracy and transferability. Our work establishes vibrational spectroscopy as a viable, non-destructive probe for point defect quantification in bulk materials, and highlights the promise of foundation models in data-driven defect engineering.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

To bridge this gap, we introduce QoQ-Med-7B/32B, the first open generalist clinical foundation model that jointly reasons across medical images, time-series signals, and text reports. QoQ-Med is trained with Domain-aware Relative Policy Optimization (DRPO), a novel reinforcement-learning objective that hierarchically scales normalized rewards according to domain rarity and modality difficulty, mitigating performance imbalance caused by skewed clinical data distributions. Trained on 2.61 million instruction tuning pairs spanning 9 clinical domains, we show that DRPO training boosts diagnostic performance by 43% in macro-F1 on average across all visual domains as compared to other critic-free training methods like GRPO. Furthermore, with QoQ-Med trained on intensive segmentation data, it is able to highlight salient regions related to the diagnosis, with an IoU 10x higher than open models while reaching the performance of OpenAI o4-mini. To foster reproducibility and downstream research, we release (i) the full model weights, (ii) the modular training pipeline, and (iii) all intermediate reasoning traces at https://github.com/DDVD233/QoQ_Med.</p></details> |  |

While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or region-of-interest (ROI) features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations.

However, extracting clinically important measurements such as ejection fraction for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases remains time-consuming and subjective. We developed CineMA, a foundation AI model automating these tasks with limited labels. CineMA is a self-supervised autoencoder model trained on 74,916 cine CMR studies to reconstruct images from masked inputs. After fine-tuning, it was evaluated across eight datasets on 23 tasks from four categories: ventricle and myocardium segmentation, left and right ventricle ejection fraction calculation, disease detection and classification, and landmark localisation. CineMA is the first foundation model for cine CMR to match or outperform convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CineMA demonstrated greater label efficiency than CNNs, achieving comparable or better performance with fewer annotations. This reduces the burden of clinician labelling and supports replacing task-specific training with fine-tuning foundation models in future cardiac imaging applications. Models and code for pre-training and fine-tuning are available at https://github.com/mathpluscode/CineMA, democratising access to high-performance models that otherwise require substantial computational resources, promoting reproducibility and accelerating clinical translation.</p></details> |  |

In scenarios lacking extensive data from a target building, foundation models (FMs) represent a promising technology that can leverage prior knowledge from vast and diverse pre-training datasets to construct accurate probabilistic predictors for use in decision-making tools. This paper investigates the applicability and fine-tuning strategies of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) in building energy forecasting. We analyze both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches, particularly low-rank adaptation (LoRA), by using real-world data from a commercial net-zero energy building to capture signals such as room occupancy, carbon emissions, plug loads, and HVAC energy consumption. Our analysis reveals that the zero-shot predictive performance of TSFMs is generally suboptimal. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate that employing either full fine-tuning or parameter-efficient fine-tuning significantly enhances forecasting accuracy, even with limited historical data. Notably, fine-tuning with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) substantially reduces computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, fine-tuned TSFMs consistently outperform state-of-the-art deep forecasting models (e.g., temporal fusion transformers) in accuracy, robustness, and generalization across varying building zones and seasonal conditions. These results underline the efficacy of TSFMs for practical, data-constrained building energy management systems, enabling improved decision-making in pursuit of energy efficiency and sustainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version appeared in NeurIPS TSALM Workshop: https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/103019</p></details> |

This paper proposes a multimodal cognition and embodied decision-making brain system, ``Wenlu", designed to enable secure fusion of private knowledge and public models, unified processing of multimodal data such as images and speech, and closed-loop decision-making from cognition to automatic generation of hardware-level code. The system introduces a brain-inspired memory tagging and replay mechanism, seamlessly integrating user-private data, industry-specific knowledge, and general-purpose language models. It provides precise and efficient multimodal services for enterprise decision support, medical analysis, autonomous driving, robotic control, and more. Compared with existing solutions, ``Wenlu" demonstrates significant advantages in multimodal processing, privacy security, end-to-end hardware control code generation, self-learning, and sustainable updates, thus laying a solid foundation for constructing the next-generation intelligent core.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-informed Temporal Alignment for Auto-regressive PDE Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10930v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auto-regressive partial differential equation (PDE) foundation models have shown great potential in handling time-dependent data. However, these models suffer from the shortcut problem deeply rooted in auto-regressive prediction, causing error accumulation. The challenge becomes particularly evident for out-of-distribution data, as the pretraining performance may approach random model initialization for downstream tasks with long-term dynamics. To deal with this problem, we propose physics-informed temporal alignment (PITA), a self-supervised learning framework inspired by inverse problem solving. Specifically, PITA aligns the physical dynamics discovered at different time steps on each given PDE trajectory by integrating physics-informed constraints into the self-supervision signal. The alignment is derived from observation data without relying on known physics priors, indicating strong generalization ability to the out-of-distribution data. Extensive experiments show that PITA significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of existing foundation models on diverse time-dependent PDE data.

Unfortunately, existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative Predictive Value), outperforming feature-based tree models as well as general and medical large language models by large margins. Despite significant demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

However, their closed nature--with inaccessible training data and code--poses major reproducibility and fair evaluation challenges. While other domains have made substantial progress toward open science by developing fully transparent models trained on open-source (OS) code and data, similar efforts in speech remain limited. To fill this gap, we introduce FAMA, the first family of open science SFMs for English and Italian, trained on 150k+ hours of OS speech data. Moreover, we present a new dataset containing 16k hours of cleaned and pseudo-labeled speech for both languages. Results show that FAMA achieves competitive performance compared to existing SFMs while being up to 8 times faster. All artifacts, including code, datasets, and models, are released under OS-compliant licenses, promoting openness in speech technology research.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Road to Generalizable Neuro-Symbolic Learning Should be Paved with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24874v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic learning was proposed to address challenges with training neural networks for complex reasoning tasks with the added benefits of interpretability, reliability, and efficiency. Neuro-symbolic learning methods traditionally train neural models in conjunction with symbolic programs, but they face significant challenges that limit them to simplistic problems. On the other hand, purely-neural foundation models now reach state-of-the-art performance through prompting rather than training, but they are often unreliable and lack interpretability. Supplementing foundation models with symbolic programs, which we call neuro-symbolic prompting, provides a way to use these models for complex reasoning tasks. Doing so raises the question: What role does specialized model training as part of neuro-symbolic learning have in the age of foundation models? To explore this question, we highlight three pitfalls of traditional neuro-symbolic learning with respect to the compute, data, and programs leading to generalization problems. This position paper argues that foundation models enable generalizable neuro-symbolic solutions, offering a path towards achieving the original goals of neuro-symbolic learning without the downsides of training from scratch.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Defining Foundation Models for Computational Science: A Call for Clarity and Rigor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22904v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread success of foundation models in natural language processing and computer vision has inspired researchers to extend the concept to scientific machine learning and computational science. However, this position paper argues that as the term "foundation model" is an evolving concept, its application in computational science is increasingly used without a universally accepted definition, potentially creating confusion and diluting its precise scientific meaning. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a formal definition of foundation models in computational science, grounded in the core values of generality, reusability, and scalability. We articulate a set of essential and desirable characteristics that such models must exhibit, drawing parallels with traditional foundational methods, like the finite element and finite volume methods. Furthermore, we introduce the Data-Driven Finite Element Method (DD-FEM), a framework that fuses the modular structure of classical FEM with the representational power of data-driven learning. We demonstrate how DD-FEM addresses many of the key challenges in realizing foundation models for computational science, including scalability, adaptability, and physics consistency. By bridging traditional numerical methods with modern AI paradigms, this work provides a rigorous foundation for evaluating and developing novel approaches toward future foundation models in computational science.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 2 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

Foundation models mitigate this burden by leveraging self-supervised pretraining; however, the scarcity of open-weight ECG foundation models hinders adoption and cross-study comparability. We present ECG-FM, an open foundation model for ECG analysis, and conduct a study using a dataset of 1.5 million ECGs. ECG-FM is a transformer-based model pretrained using a hybrid contrastive and generative self-supervised learning approach. Our downstream tasks include predicting reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ECG interpretation labels, where we release a benchmark task on the MIMIC-IV-ECG dataset. We affirm that ECG-FM is robust, label-efficient, and functionally discriminative by showcasing data scaling experiments, performing a latent space analysis, and generating saliency maps. ECG-FM markedly outperforms task-specific models in the small-to-medium-scale data regime and demonstrates cross-dataset generalizability, achieving high AUROC on many clinically salient labels such as atrial fibrillation (0.996) and LVEF<=40% (0.929).

To predict the next-patch's distribution, we propose a TimeFlow Loss based on flow-matching, which facilitates native pre-training of Transformers on continuous-valued time series without discrete tokenization. Conditioned on arbitrary-length time series, our models are pre-trained without specifying any prior distribution and can generate multiple probable predictions, achieving more flexibility in representation learning than using parametric densities. Towards time series foundation models, we leverage minimal but crucial adaptations of Transformers and curate TimeBench with one trillion time points, comprising mostly real-world datasets and synthetic data. By mitigating mode collapse via TimeFlow Loss, we pre-train a family of Sundial models on TimeBench, which achieve unprecedented model capacity and generalization performance. In addition to excellent scalability, Sundial achieves state-of-the-art results on both point and probabilistic forecasting benchmarks with a just-in-time inference speed, i.e., making zero-shot predictions within a few milliseconds. We believe that Sundial's pioneering generative forecasting capability can improve model reliability in real-world decision-making.

Recent advances in this area adopt centralized post-training approaches that build upon black-box foundation language models where there is no access to model weights and architecture details. Although the use of black-box models has been successful in centralized post-training, their blind replication in FL raises several concerns. Our position is that using black-box models in FL contradicts the core principles of federation such as data privacy and autonomy. In this position paper, we critically analyze the usage of black-box models in federated post-training, and provide a detailed account of various aspects of openness and their implications for FL.</p></details> |  |

Previous investigations in medical images have often been constrained to specific anatomical regions, particular applications, and limited datasets, resulting in isolated diffusion models. This paper introduces a diffusion-based foundation model to address a diverse range of medical image tasks, namely MedDiff-FM. MedDiff-FM leverages 3D CT images from multiple publicly available datasets, covering anatomical regions from head to abdomen, to pre-train a diffusion foundation model, and explores the capabilities of the diffusion foundation model across a variety of application scenarios. The diffusion foundation model handles multi-level integrated image processing both at the image-level and patch-level, utilizes position embedding to establish multi-level spatial relationships, and leverages region classes and anatomical structures to capture certain anatomical regions. MedDiff-FM manages several downstream tasks seamlessly, including image denoising, anomaly detection, and image synthesis. MedDiff-FM is also capable of performing super-resolution, lesion generation, and lesion inpainting by rapidly fine-tuning the diffusion foundation model using ControlNet with task-specific conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MedDiff-FM in addressing diverse downstream medical image tasks.</p></details> |  |

They promise improved generalization across tasks, scalability, and efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data. However, despite the rapid proliferation of geospatial FMs, their real-world utility and alignment with global sustainability goals remain underexplored. We introduce SustainFM, a comprehensive benchmarking framework grounded in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals with extremely diverse tasks ranging from asset wealth prediction to environmental hazard detection. This study provides a rigorous, interdisciplinary assessment of geospatial FMs and offers critical insights into their role in attaining sustainability goals. Our findings show: (1) While not universally superior, FMs often outperform traditional approaches across diverse tasks and datasets. (2) Evaluating FMs should go beyond accuracy to include transferability, generalization, and energy efficiency as key criteria for their responsible use. (3) FMs enable scalable, SDG-grounded solutions, offering broad utility for tackling complex sustainability challenges. Critically, we advocate for a paradigm shift from model-centric development to impact-driven deployment, and emphasize metrics such as energy efficiency, robustness to domain shifts, and ethical considerations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Assessment of Pathological Voices via Combined Low-Level Descriptors and Foundation Model Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21356v3)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceptual voice quality assessment is essential for diagnosing and monitoring voice disorders by providing standardized evaluations of vocal function. Traditionally, expert raters use standard scales such as the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) and Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain (GRBAS). However, these metrics are subjective and prone to inter-rater variability, motivating the need for automated, objective assessment methods. This study proposes Voice Quality Assessment Network (VOQANet), a deep learning-based framework with an attention mechanism that leverages a Speech Foundation Model (SFM) to extract high-level acoustic and prosodic information from raw speech. To enhance robustness and interpretability, we also introduce VOQANet+, which integrates low-level speech descriptors such as jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) with SFM embeddings into a hybrid representation. Unlike prior studies focused only on vowel-based phonation (PVQD-A subset) of the Perceptual Voice Quality Dataset (PVQD), we evaluate our models on both vowel-based and sentence-level speech (PVQD-S subset) to improve generalizability. Results show that sentence-based input outperforms vowel-based input, especially at the patient level, underscoring the value of longer utterances for capturing perceptual voice attributes. VOQANet consistently surpasses baseline methods in root mean squared error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) across CAPE-V and GRBAS dimensions, with VOQANet+ achieving even better performance. Additional experiments under noisy conditions show that VOQANet+ maintains high prediction accuracy and robustness, supporting its potential for real-world and telehealth deployment.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we examine and analyze the understanding and characteristics of negation in various fields such as philosophy, logic, and linguistics etc. Based on the distinction between the concepts of contradiction and opposition, we propose that there are three different types of negation in knowledge from a conceptual perspective: contradictory negation, opposite negation, and intermediary negation. To establish a mathematical foundation that fully reflects the intrinsic connections, properties, and laws of these different forms of negation, we introduce SCOI: sets with contradictory negation, opposite negation and intermediary negation, and LCOI: logic with contradictory negation, opposite negation and intermediary negation, and we proved the main operational properties of SCOI as well as the formal inference relations in LCOI.</p></details> | 32 pages,13 figures |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey on Physical Risk Control in the Era of Foundation Model-enabled Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12583v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Foundation Model-enabled robotics (FMRs) display greatly improved general-purpose skills, enabling more adaptable automation than conventional robotics. Their ability to handle diverse tasks thus creates new opportunities to replace human labor. However, unlike general foundation models, FMRs interact with the physical world, where their actions directly affect the safety of humans and surrounding objects, requiring careful deployment and control. Based on this proposition, our survey comprehensively summarizes robot control approaches to mitigate physical risks by covering all the lifespan of FMRs ranging from pre-deployment to post-accident stage. Specifically, we broadly divide the timeline into the following three phases: (1) pre-deployment phase, (2) pre-incident phase, and (3) post-incident phase. Throughout this survey, we find that there is much room to study (i) pre-incident risk mitigation strategies, (ii) research that assumes physical interaction with humans, and (iii) essential issues of foundation models themselves. We hope that this survey will be a milestone in providing a high-resolution analysis of the physical risks of FMRs and their control, contributing to the realization of a good human-robot relationship.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCAI 2025 Survey Track</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Domain Graph Foundation Models: Robust Knowledge Transfer via Topology Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02017v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in CV and NLP have inspired researchers to develop general-purpose graph foundation models through pre-training across diverse domains. However, a fundamental challenge arises from the substantial differences in graph topologies across domains. Additionally, real-world graphs are often sparse and prone to noisy connections and adversarial attacks. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-Domain Graph Foundation Model (MDGFM), a unified framework that aligns and leverages cross-domain topological information to facilitate robust knowledge transfer. MDGFM bridges different domains by adaptively balancing features and topology while refining original graphs to eliminate noise and align topological structures. To further enhance knowledge transfer, we introduce an efficient prompt-tuning approach. By aligning topologies, MDGFM not only improves multi-domain pre-training but also enables robust knowledge transfer to unseen domains. Theoretical analyses provide guarantees of MDGFM's effectiveness and domain generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets validate the robustness and efficacy of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Foundation Models for Robust and Generalizable 6-DOF Bronchoscopy Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24249v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based 6-DOF bronchoscopy localization offers a promising solution for accurate and cost-effective interventional guidance. However, existing methods struggle with 1) limited generalization across patient cases due to scarce labeled data, and 2) poor robustness under visual degradation, as bronchoscopy procedures frequently involve artifacts such as occlusions and motion blur that impair visual information. To address these challenges, we propose PANSv2, a generalizable and robust bronchoscopy localization framework. Motivated by PANS that leverages multiple visual cues for pose likelihood measurement, PANSv2 integrates depth estimation, landmark detection, and centerline constraints into a unified pose optimization framework that evaluates pose probability and solves for the optimal bronchoscope pose. To further enhance generalization capabilities, we leverage the endoscopic foundation model EndoOmni for depth estimation and the video foundation model EndoMamba for landmark detection, incorporating both spatial and temporal analyses. Pretrained on diverse endoscopic datasets, these models provide stable and transferable visual representations, enabling reliable performance across varied bronchoscopy scenarios. Additionally, to improve robustness to visual degradation, we introduce an automatic re-initialization module that detects tracking failures and re-establishes pose using landmark detections once clear views are available. Experimental results on bronchoscopy dataset encompassing 10 patient cases show that PANSv2 achieves the highest tracking success rate, with an 18.1% improvement in SR-5 (percentage of absolute trajectory error under 5 mm) compared to existing methods, showing potential towards real clinical usage.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Hallucinations to Jailbreaks: Rethinking the Vulnerability of Large Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24232v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large foundation models (LFMs) are susceptible to two distinct vulnerabilities: hallucinations and jailbreak attacks. While typically studied in isolation, we observe that defenses targeting one often affect the other, hinting at a deeper connection. We propose a unified theoretical framework that models jailbreaks as token-level optimization and hallucinations as attention-level optimization. Within this framework, we establish two key propositions: (1) \textit{Similar Loss Convergence} - the loss functions for both vulnerabilities converge similarly when optimizing for target-specific outputs; and (2) \textit{Gradient Consistency in Attention Redistribution} - both exhibit consistent gradient behavior driven by shared attention dynamics. We validate these propositions empirically on LLaVA-1.5 and MiniGPT-4, showing consistent optimization trends and aligned gradients. Leveraging this connection, we demonstrate that mitigation techniques for hallucinations can reduce jailbreak success rates, and vice versa. Our findings reveal a shared failure mode in LFMs and suggest that robustness strategies should jointly address both vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Biometric Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24214v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of foundation models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), has redefined the frontiers of artificial intelligence, enabling remarkable generalization across diverse tasks with minimal or no supervision. Yet, their potential in biometric recognition and analysis remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the zero-shot and few-shot performance of state-of-the-art publicly available VLMs and MLLMs across six biometric tasks spanning the face and iris modalities: face verification, soft biometric attribute prediction (gender and race), iris recognition, presentation attack detection (PAD), and face manipulation detection (morphs and deepfakes). A total of 41 VLMs were used in this evaluation. Experiments show that embeddings from these foundation models can be used for diverse biometric tasks with varying degrees of success. For example, in the case of face verification, a True Match Rate (TMR) of 96.77 percent was obtained at a False Match Rate (FMR) of 1 percent on the Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW) dataset, without any fine-tuning. In the case of iris recognition, the TMR at 1 percent FMR on the IITD-R-Full dataset was 97.55 percent without any fine-tuning. Further, we show that applying a simple classifier head to these embeddings can help perform DeepFake detection for faces, Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) for irides, and extract soft biometric attributes like gender and ethnicity from faces with reasonably high accuracy. This work reiterates the potential of pretrained models in achieving the long-term vision of Artificial General Intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the LUMIR challenge: The pathway to foundational registration models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24160v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image challenges have played a transformative role in advancing the field, catalyzing algorithmic innovation and establishing new performance standards across diverse clinical applications. Image registration, a foundational task in neuroimaging pipelines, has similarly benefited from the Learn2Reg initiative. Building on this foundation, we introduce the Large-scale Unsupervised Brain MRI Image Registration (LUMIR) challenge, a next-generation benchmark designed to assess and advance unsupervised brain MRI registration. Distinct from prior challenges that leveraged anatomical label maps for supervision, LUMIR removes this dependency by providing over 4,000 preprocessed T1-weighted brain MRIs for training without any label maps, encouraging biologically plausible deformation modeling through self-supervision. In addition to evaluating performance on 590 held-out test subjects, LUMIR introduces a rigorous suite of zero-shot generalization tasks, spanning out-of-domain imaging modalities (e.g., FLAIR, T2-weighted, T2*-weighted), disease populations (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), acquisition protocols (e.g., 9.4T MRI), and species (e.g., macaque brains). A total of 1,158 subjects and over 4,000 image pairs were included for evaluation. Performance was assessed using both segmentation-based metrics (Dice coefficient, 95th percentile Hausdorff distance) and landmark-based registration accuracy (target registration error). Across both in-domain and zero-shot tasks, deep learning-based methods consistently achieved state-of-the-art accuracy while producing anatomically plausible deformation fields. The top-performing deep learning-based models demonstrated diffeomorphic properties and inverse consistency, outperforming several leading optimization-based methods, and showing strong robustness to most domain shifts, the exception being a drop in performance on out-of-domain contrasts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Generalizable Bimanual Foundation Policy via Flow-based Video Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24156v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning a generalizable bimanual manipulation policy is extremely challenging for embodied agents due to the large action space and the need for coordinated arm movements. Existing approaches rely on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to acquire bimanual policies. However, transferring knowledge from single-arm datasets or pre-trained VLA models often fails to generalize effectively, primarily due to the scarcity of bimanual data and the fundamental differences between single-arm and bimanual manipulation. In this paper, we propose a novel bimanual foundation policy by fine-tuning the leading text-to-video models to predict robot trajectories and training a lightweight diffusion policy for action generation. Given the lack of embodied knowledge in text-to-video models, we introduce a two-stage paradigm that fine-tunes independent text-to-flow and flow-to-video models derived from a pre-trained text-to-video model. Specifically, optical flow serves as an intermediate variable, providing a concise representation of subtle movements between images. The text-to-flow model predicts optical flow to concretize the intent of language instructions, and the flow-to-video model leverages this flow for fine-grained video prediction. Our method mitigates the ambiguity of language in single-stage text-to-video prediction and significantly reduces the robot-data requirement by avoiding direct use of low-level actions. In experiments, we collect high-quality manipulation data for real dual-arm robot, and the results of simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Butterfly Effect in Pathology: Exploring Security in Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24141v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of pathology foundation models in both research and clinical decision support systems, exploring their security has become a critical concern. However, despite their growing impact, the vulnerability of these models to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the security of pathology foundation models for whole slide image~(WSI) analysis against adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce the principle of \textit{local perturbation with global impact} and propose a label-free attack framework that operates without requiring access to downstream task labels. Under this attack framework, we revise four classical white-box attack methods and redefine the perturbation budget based on the characteristics of WSI. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three representative pathology foundation models across five datasets and six downstream tasks. Despite modifying only 0.1\% of patches per slide with imperceptible noise, our attack leads to downstream accuracy degradation that can reach up to 20\% in the worst cases. Furthermore, we analyze key factors that influence attack success, explore the relationship between patch-level vulnerability and semantic content, and conduct a preliminary investigation into potential defence strategies. These findings lay the groundwork for future research on the adversarial robustness and reliable deployment of pathology foundation models. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Jiashuai-Liu-hmos/Attack-WSI-pathology-foundation-models.</p></details> |  |

Although deep learning has shown success in supporting GI diagnostics and decision-making, these models require curated datasets with labels that are expensive to acquire. Foundation models offer a promising solution by learning general-purpose representations, which can be finetuned for specific tasks, overcoming data scarcity. Developing foundation models for medical imaging holds significant potential, but the sensitive and protected nature of medical data presents unique challenges. Foundation model training typically requires extensive datasets, and while hospitals generate large volumes of data, privacy restrictions prevent direct data sharing, making foundation model training infeasible in most scenarios. In this work, we propose a FL framework for training foundation models for gastroendoscopy imaging, enabling data to remain within local hospital environments while contributing to a shared model. We explore several established FL algorithms, assessing their suitability for training foundation models without relying on task-specific labels, conducting experiments in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. We evaluate the trained foundation model on three critical downstream tasks--classification, detection, and segmentation--and demonstrate that it achieves improved performance across all tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in a federated, privacy-preserving setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 11 figures, submitted to BHI2025</p></details> |
| **[Proxy-FDA: Proxy-based Feature Distribution Alignment for Fine-tuning Vision Foundation Models without Forgetting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24088v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models pre-trained on massive data encode rich representations of real-world concepts, which can be adapted to downstream tasks by fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning foundation models on one task often leads to the issue of concept forgetting on other tasks. Recent methods of robust fine-tuning aim to mitigate forgetting of prior knowledge without affecting the fine-tuning performance. Knowledge is often preserved by matching the original and fine-tuned model weights or feature pairs. However, such point-wise matching can be too strong, without explicit awareness of the feature neighborhood structures that encode rich knowledge as well. We propose a novel regularization method Proxy-FDA that explicitly preserves the structural knowledge in feature space. Proxy-FDA performs Feature Distribution Alignment (using nearest neighbor graphs) between the pre-trained and fine-tuned feature spaces, and the alignment is further improved by informative proxies that are generated dynamically to increase data diversity. Experiments show that Proxy-FDA significantly reduces concept forgetting during fine-tuning, and we find a strong correlation between forgetting and a distributional distance metric (in comparison to L2 distance). We further demonstrate Proxy-FDA's benefits in various fine-tuning settings (end-to-end, few-shot and continual tuning) and across different tasks like image classification, captioning and VQA.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Foundation Models for Rapid Autonomy Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03328v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We are motivated by the problem of autonomous vehicle performance validation. A key challenge is that an autonomous vehicle requires testing in every kind of driving scenario it could encounter, including rare events, to provide a strong case for safety and show there is no edge-case pathological behavior. Autonomous vehicle companies rely on potentially millions of miles driven in realistic simulation to expose the driving stack to enough miles to estimate rates and severity of collisions. To address scalability and coverage, we propose the use of a behavior foundation model, specifically a masked autoencoder (MAE), trained to reconstruct driving scenarios. We leverage the foundation model in two complementary ways: we (i) use the learned embedding space to group qualitatively similar scenarios together and (ii) fine-tune the model to label scenario difficulty based on the likelihood of a collision upon simulation. We use the difficulty scoring as importance weighting for the groups of scenarios. The result is an approach which can more rapidly estimate the rates and severity of collisions by prioritizing hard scenarios while ensuring exposure to every kind of driving scenario.</p></details> |  |

However, such reasoning abilities remain underexplored and notably absent in vision foundation models, including representation models like the DINO series. In this work, we propose \textbf{DINO-R1}, the first such attempt to incentivize visual in-context reasoning capabilities of vision foundation models using reinforcement learning. Specifically, DINO-R1 introduces \textbf{Group Relative Query Optimization (GRQO)}, a novel reinforcement-style training strategy explicitly designed for query-based representation models, which computes query-level rewards based on group-normalized alignment quality. We also apply KL-regularization to stabilize the objectness distribution to reduce the training instability. This joint optimization enables dense and expressive supervision across queries while mitigating overfitting and distributional drift. Building upon Grounding-DINO, we train a series of DINO-R1 family models that integrate a visual prompt encoder and a visual-guided query selection mechanism. Extensive experiments on COCO, LVIS, and ODinW demonstrate that DINO-R1 significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning baselines, achieving strong generalization in both open-vocabulary and closed-set visual prompting scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[GIT-BO: High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization with Tabular Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20685v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian optimization (BO) effectively optimizes expensive black-box functions but faces significant challenges in high-dimensional spaces (dimensions exceeding 100) due to the curse of dimensionality. Existing high-dimensional BO methods typically leverage low-dimensional embeddings or structural assumptions to mitigate this challenge, yet these approaches frequently incur considerable computational overhead and rigidity due to iterative surrogate retraining and fixed assumptions. To address these limitations, we propose Gradient-Informed Bayesian Optimization using Tabular Foundation Models (GIT-BO), an approach that utilizes a pre-trained tabular foundation model (TFM) as a surrogate, leveraging its gradient information to adaptively identify low-dimensional subspaces for optimization. We propose a way to exploit internal gradient computations from the TFM's forward pass by creating a gradient-informed diagnostic matrix that reveals the most sensitive directions of the TFM's predictions, enabling optimization in a continuously re-estimated active subspace without the need for repeated model retraining. Extensive empirical evaluation across 23 synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrates that GIT-BO consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art Gaussian process-based high-dimensional BO methods, showing superior scalability and optimization performances, especially as dimensionality increases up to 500 dimensions. This work establishes foundation models, augmented with gradient-informed adaptive subspace identification, as highly competitive alternatives to traditional Gaussian process-based approaches for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FMG-Det: Foundation Model Guided Robust Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23726v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting high quality data for object detection tasks is challenging due to the inherent subjectivity in labeling the boundaries of an object. This makes it difficult to not only collect consistent annotations across a dataset but also to validate them, as no two annotators are likely to label the same object using the exact same coordinates. These challenges are further compounded when object boundaries are partially visible or blurred, which can be the case in many domains. Training on noisy annotations significantly degrades detector performance, rendering them unusable, particularly in few-shot settings, where just a few corrupted annotations can impact model performance. In this work, we propose FMG-Det, a simple, efficient methodology for training models with noisy annotations. More specifically, we propose combining a multiple instance learning (MIL) framework with a pre-processing pipeline that leverages powerful foundation models to correct labels prior to training. This pre-processing pipeline, along with slight modifications to the detector head, results in state-of-the-art performance across a number of datasets, for both standard and few-shot scenarios, while being much simpler and more efficient than other approaches.</p></details> | 10 pages, ICIP 2025 |

Recently, self-supervised acoustic representation foundation models (FMs) have been proposed to offer insights into acoustics-based vital signs. However, there has been little exploration of the extent to which auscultation is encoded in these pre-trained FM representations. In this work, using a publicly available phonocardiogram (PCG) dataset and a heart rate (HR) estimation model, we conduct a layer-wise investigation of six acoustic representation FMs: HuBERT, wav2vec2, wavLM, Whisper, Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), and an in-house CLAP model. Additionally, we implement the baseline method from Nie et al., 2024 (which relies on acoustic features) and show that overall, representation vectors from pre-trained foundation models (FMs) offer comparable performance to the baseline. Notably, HR estimation using the representations from the audio encoder of the in-house CLAP model outperforms the results obtained from the baseline, achieving a lower mean absolute error (MAE) across various train/validation/test splits despite the domain mismatch.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, Interspeech 2025 conference</p></details> |

However, current T2V models often struggle to generate physically plausible content due to their limited inherent ability to accurately understand physics. We found that while the representations within T2V models possess some capacity for physics understanding, they lag significantly behind those from recent video self-supervised learning methods. To this end, we propose a novel framework called VideoREPA, which distills physics understanding capability from video understanding foundation models into T2V models by aligning token-level relations. This closes the physics understanding gap and enable more physics-plausible generation. Specifically, we introduce the Token Relation Distillation (TRD) loss, leveraging spatio-temporal alignment to provide soft guidance suitable for finetuning powerful pre-trained T2V models, a critical departure from prior representation alignment (REPA) methods. To our knowledge, VideoREPA is the first REPA method designed for finetuning T2V models and specifically for injecting physical knowledge. Empirical evaluations show that VideoREPA substantially enhances the physics commonsense of baseline method, CogVideoX, achieving significant improvement on relevant benchmarks and demonstrating a strong capacity for generating videos consistent with intuitive physics.

Existing research has primarily focused on algorithms for specific tasks, which have limited applicability in a broad range of ARS vision applications. This paper proposes the RingMo-Aerial model, aiming to fill the gap in foundation model research in the field of ARS vision. By introducing the Frequency-Enhanced Multi-Head Self-Attention (FE-MSA) mechanism and an affine transformation-based contrastive learning pre-training method, the model's detection capability for small targets is enhanced and optimized for the tilted viewing angles characteristic of ARS. Furthermore, the ARS-Adapter, an efficient parameter fine-tuning method, is proposed to improve the model's adaptability and effectiveness in various ARS vision tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that RingMo-Aerial achieves SOTA performance on multiple downstream tasks. This indicates the practicality and efficacy of RingMo-Aerial in enhancing the performance of ARS vision tasks.</p></details> |  |

Central to BriGeS is the Bridging Gate, which integrates the complementary strengths of depth and segmentation foundation models. This integration is further refined by our Attention Temperature Scaling technique. It finely adjusts the focus of the attention mechanisms to prevent over-concentration on specific features, thus ensuring balanced performance across diverse inputs. BriGeS capitalizes on pre-trained foundation models and adopts a strategy that focuses on training only the Bridging Gate. This method significantly reduces resource demands and training time while maintaining the model's ability to generalize effectively. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging datasets demonstrate that BriGeS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in MDE for complex scenes, effectively handling intricate structures and overlapping objects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representing local protein environments with atomistic foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23354v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The local structure of a protein strongly impacts its function and interactions with other molecules. Therefore, a concise, informative representation of a local protein environment is essential for modeling and designing proteins and biomolecular interactions. However, these environments' extensive structural and chemical variability makes them challenging to model, and such representations remain under-explored. In this work, we propose a novel representation for a local protein environment derived from the intermediate features of atomistic foundation models (AFMs). We demonstrate that this embedding effectively captures both local structure (e.g., secondary motifs), and chemical features (e.g., amino-acid identity and protonation state). We further show that the AFM-derived representation space exhibits meaningful structure, enabling the construction of data-driven priors over the distribution of biomolecular environments. Finally, in the context of biomolecular NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the proposed representations enable a first-of-its-kind physics-informed chemical shift predictor that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Our results demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of atomistic foundation models and their emergent representations for protein modeling beyond traditional molecular simulations. We believe this will open new lines of work in constructing effective functional representations for protein environments.</p></details> |  |

Surprisingly, even after fine-tuning, TSFMs cannot consistently outperform smaller, specialized models trained on full-shot downstream data. A key question is how to realize effective adaptation of TSFMs for a target forecasting task. Through empirical studies on various TSFMs, the pre-trained models often exhibit inherent sparsity and redundancy in computation, suggesting that TSFMs have learned to activate task-relevant network substructures to accommodate diverse forecasting tasks. To preserve this valuable prior knowledge, we propose a structured pruning method to regularize the subsequent fine-tuning process by focusing it on a more relevant and compact parameter space. Extensive experiments on seven TSFMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning a smaller, pruned TSFM significantly improves forecasting performance compared to fine-tuning original models. This "prune-then-finetune" paradigm often enables TSFMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance and surpass strong specialized baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript with fixed typos and figures</p></details> |

It provides methods to bypass the need for explicit channel estimation in practical scenarios such as high-mobility networks, massive distributed antenna arrays, energy-constrained Internet-of-Things devices, and unstructured propagation environments. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of noncoherent communication strategies in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, focusing on recent advances since the early 2000s. We classify noncoherent communication schemes into three main approaches where CSI-free signal recovery is based on subspace detection (i.e., Grassmannian signaling), differential detection, and energy detection, respectively. For each approach, we review the theoretical foundation and design methodologies. We also provide comparative insights into their suitability across different channel models and system constraints, highlighting application scenarios where noncoherent methods offer performance and scalability advantages over traditional coherent communication. Furthermore, we discuss practical considerations of noncoherent communication, including compatibility with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), resilience to hardware impairments, and scalability with the number of users. Finally, we provide an outlook on future challenges and research directions in designing robust and efficient noncoherent systems for next-generation wireless networks.</p></details> |  |

We present OmniArch, the first prototype aiming at solving multi-scale and multi-physics scientific computing problems with physical alignment. We addressed all three challenges with one unified architecture. Its pre-training stage contains a Fourier Encoder-decoder fading out the disharmony across separated dimensions and a Transformer backbone integrating quantities through temporal dynamics, and the novel PDE-Aligner performs physics-informed fine-tuning under flexible conditions. As far as we know, we first conduct 1D-2D-3D united pre-training on the PDEBench, and it sets not only new performance benchmarks for 1D, 2D, and 3D PDEs but also demonstrates exceptional adaptability to new physics via in-context and zero-shot learning approaches, which supports realistic engineering applications and foresight physics discovery.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, existing biomedical AI models generally lack the ability to simultaneously generate diagnostic findings and localize corresponding biomedical objects. This limitation makes it challenging for clinicians to correlate AI-generated findings with visual evidence (e.g., tiny lesions) in images and interpret the results of AI models. To address this challenge, we introduce UniBiomed, the first universal foundation model for grounded biomedical image interpretation, which is capable of generating accurate diagnostic findings and simultaneously segmenting the corresponding biomedical targets. UniBiomed is based on a novel integration of Multi-modal Large Language Model and Segment Anything Model, which can effectively unify diverse biomedical tasks in universal training for advancing grounded interpretation. To develop UniBiomed, we curate a large-scale dataset comprising over 27 million triplets of images, region annotations, and text descriptions across ten biomedical imaging modalities. Extensive validation on 70 internal and 14 external datasets demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of UniBiomed in diverse biomedical tasks, including image segmentation, disease recognition, region-aware diagnosis, vision question answering, and report generation. In summary, UniBiomed is a powerful and versatile biomedical foundation model, unlocking the untapped grounded interpretation capability for optimizing AI-assisted biomedical image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first universal foundation model for grounded biomedical image interpretation</p></details> |

Theoretical Foundations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23081v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper establishes the theoretical foundations of the online scaled gradient methods (OSGM), a framework that utilizes online learning to adapt stepsizes and provably accelerate first-order methods. OSGM quantifies the effectiveness of a stepsize by a feedback function motivated from a convergence measure and uses the feedback to adjust the stepsize through an online learning algorithm. Consequently, instantiations of OSGM achieve convergence rates that are asymptotically no worse than the optimal stepsize. OSGM yields desirable convergence guarantees on smooth convex problems, including 1) trajectory-dependent global convergence on smooth convex objectives; 2) an improved complexity result on smooth strongly convex problems, and 3) local superlinear convergence. Notably, OSGM constitutes a new family of first-order methods with non-asymptotic superlinear convergence, joining the celebrated quasi-Newton methods. Finally, OSGM explains the empirical success of the popular hypergradient-descent heuristic in optimization for machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extension of arXiv:2411.01803 and arXiv:2502.11229</p></details> |

| **[Exploring Scaling Laws for EHR Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22964v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of scaling laws has profoundly shaped the development of large language models (LLMs), enabling predictable performance gains through systematic increases in model size, dataset volume, and compute. Yet, these principles remain largely unexplored in the context of electronic health records (EHRs) -- a rich, sequential, and globally abundant data source that differs structurally from natural language. In this work, we present the first empirical investigation of scaling laws for EHR foundation models. By training transformer architectures on patient timeline data from the MIMIC-IV database across varying model sizes and compute budgets, we identify consistent scaling patterns, including parabolic IsoFLOPs curves and power-law relationships between compute, model parameters, data size, and clinical utility. These findings demonstrate that EHR models exhibit scaling behavior analogous to LLMs, offering predictive insights into resource-efficient training strategies. Our results lay the groundwork for developing powerful EHR foundation models capable of transforming clinical prediction tasks and advancing personalized healthcare.</p></details> |  |

However, grammar learning therein relies on expert annotation or unreliable heuristics for algorithmic inference. We propose Foundation Molecular Grammar (FMG), which leverages multi-modal foundation models (MMFMs) to induce an interpretable molecular language. By exploiting the chemical knowledge of an MMFM, FMG renders molecules as images, describes them as text, and aligns information across modalities using prompt learning. FMG can be used as a drop-in replacement for the prior grammar learning approaches in molecular generation and property prediction. We show that FMG not only excels in synthesizability, diversity, and data efficiency but also offers built-in chemical interpretability for automated molecular discovery workflows.

Prior studies have trained bespoke cancer survival prediction models from unimodal or multimodal TCGA data. A modern paradigm in biomedical deep learning is the development of foundation models (FMs) to derive meaningful feature embeddings, agnostic to a specific modeling task. Biomedical text especially has seen growing development of FMs. While TCGA contains free-text data as pathology reports, these have been historically underutilized. Here, we investigate the feasibility of training classical, multimodal survival models over zero-shot embeddings extracted by FMs. We show the ease and additive effect of multimodal fusion, outperforming unimodal models. We demonstrate the benefit of including pathology report text and rigorously evaluate the effect of model-based text summarization and hallucination. Overall, we modernize survival modeling by leveraging FMs and information extraction from pathology reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables, updated with acknowledgements and declarations of interest</p></details> |

To address this critical trade-off, we introduce HiDream-I1, a new open-source image generative foundation model with 17B parameters that achieves state-of-the-art image generation quality within seconds. HiDream-I1 is constructed with a new sparse Diffusion Transformer (DiT) structure. Specifically, it starts with a dual-stream decoupled design of sparse DiT with dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, in which two separate encoders are first involved to independently process image and text tokens. Then, a single-stream sparse DiT structure with dynamic MoE architecture is adopted to trigger multi-model interaction for image generation in a cost-efficient manner. To support flexiable accessibility with varied model capabilities, we provide HiDream-I1 in three variants: HiDream-I1-Full, HiDream-I1-Dev, and HiDream-I1-Fast. Furthermore, we go beyond the typical text-to-image generation and remould HiDream-I1 with additional image conditions to perform precise, instruction-based editing on given images, yielding a new instruction-based image editing model namely HiDream-E1. Ultimately, by integrating text-to-image generation and instruction-based image editing, HiDream-I1 evolves to form a comprehensive image agent (HiDream-A1) capable of fully interactive image creation and refinement. To accelerate multi-modal AIGC research, we have open-sourced all the codes and model weights of HiDream-I1-Full, HiDream-I1-Dev, HiDream-I1-Fast, HiDream-E1 through our project websites: https://github.com/HiDream-ai/HiDream-I1 and https://github.com/HiDream-ai/HiDream-E1.

Existing infrequent communication methods like Local SGD were designed to synchronize only model parameters and cannot be trivially applied to adaptive optimizers due to additional optimizer states. Current approaches extending Local SGD either lack convergence guarantees or require synchronizing all optimizer states, tripling communication costs. We propose Desynced Low Communication Adaptive Optimizers (DES-LOC), a family of optimizers assigning independent synchronization periods to parameters and momenta, enabling lower communication costs while preserving convergence. Through extensive experiments on language models of up to 1.7B, we show that DES-LOC can communicate 170x less than DDP and 2x less than the previous state-of-the-art Local ADAM. Furthermore, unlike previous heuristic approaches, DES-LOC is suited for practical training scenarios prone to system failures. DES-LOC offers a scalable, bandwidth-efficient, and fault-tolerant solution for foundation model training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Distributed Training, Foundation Models, Large Language Models, Optimizers, Communication Efficiency, Federated Learning, Distributed Systems, Optimization Theory, Scaling, Robustness.

Current methods face inherent trade-offs between generation speed, musical coherence, and controllability. For example, LLM-based models (e.g. Yue, SongGen) excel at lyric alignment but suffer from slow inference and structural artifacts. Diffusion models (e.g. DiffRhythm), on the other hand, enable faster synthesis but often lack long-range structural coherence. ACE-Step bridges this gap by integrating diffusion-based generation with Sana's Deep Compression AutoEncoder (DCAE) and a lightweight linear transformer. It also leverages MERT and m-hubert to align semantic representations (REPA) during training, allowing rapid convergence. As a result, our model synthesizes up to 4 minutes of music in just 20 seconds on an A100 GPU-15x faster than LLM-based baselines-while achieving superior musical coherence and lyric alignment across melody, harmony, and rhythm metrics. Moreover, ACE-Step preserves fine-grained acoustic details, enabling advanced control mechanisms such as voice cloning, lyric editing, remixing, and track generation (e.g. lyric2vocal, singing2accompaniment). Rather than building yet another end-to-end text-to-music pipeline, our vision is to establish a foundation model for music AI: a fast, general-purpose, efficient yet flexible architecture that makes it easy to train subtasks on top of it. This paves the way for the development of powerful tools that seamlessly integrate into the creative workflows of music artists, producers, and content creators. In short, our goal is to build a stable diffusion moment for music.

Transformer-based remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) offer promising potential for crop mapping due to their innate ability for unified spatiotemporal processing. However, current RSFMs remain suboptimal for crop mapping: they either employ fixed spatiotemporal windows that ignore the multi-scale nature of crop systems or completely disregard temporal information by focusing solely on spatial patterns. To bridge these gaps, we present AgriFM, a multi-source remote sensing foundation model specifically designed for agricultural crop mapping. Our approach begins by establishing the necessity of simultaneous hierarchical spatiotemporal feature extraction, leading to the development of a modified Video Swin Transformer architecture where temporal down-sampling is synchronized with spatial scaling operations. This modified backbone enables efficient unified processing of long time-series satellite inputs. AgriFM leverages temporally rich data streams from three satellite sources including MODIS, Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2, and is pre-trained on a global representative dataset comprising over 25 million image samples supervised by land cover products. The resulting framework incorporates a versatile decoder architecture that dynamically fuses these learned spatiotemporal representations, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate AgriFM's superior performance over conventional deep learning approaches and state-of-the-art general-purpose RSFMs across all downstream tasks. Codes will be available at https://github.com/flyakon/AgriFM.</p></details> |  |

Conventional histopathological diagnosis, heavily reliant on the subjective interpretation of pathologists, suffers from limited reproducibility and diagnostic variability. To overcome these limitations and address the lack of pathology-specific foundation models for GI diseases, we develop Digepath, a specialized foundation model for GI pathology. Our framework introduces a dual-phase iterative optimization strategy combining pretraining with fine-screening, specifically designed to address the detection of sparsely distributed lesion areas in whole-slide images. Digepath is pretrained on more than 353 million image patches from over 200,000 hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of GI diseases. It attains state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34 tasks related to GI pathology, including pathological diagnosis, molecular prediction, gene mutation prediction, and prognosis evaluation, particularly in diagnostically ambiguous cases and resolution-agnostic tissue classification.We further translate the intelligent screening module for early GI cancer and achieve near-perfect 99.6% sensitivity across 9 independent medical institutions nationwide. The outstanding performance of Digepath highlights its potential to bridge critical gaps in histopathological practice. This work not only advances AI-driven precision pathology for GI diseases but also establishes a transferable paradigm for other pathology subspecialties.</p></details> |  |

However, despite the rich structural and textual information embedded in knowledge graphs (KGs), existing research of foundation model for KG has primarily focused on their structural aspects, with most efforts restricted to in-KG tasks (e.g., knowledge graph completion, KGC). This limitation has hindered progress in addressing more challenging out-of-KG tasks. In this paper, we introduce MERRY, a foundation model for general knowledge graph reasoning, and investigate its performance across two task categories: in-KG reasoning tasks (e.g., KGC) and out-of-KG tasks (e.g., KG question answering, KGQA). We not only utilize the structural information, but also the textual information in KGs. Specifically, we propose a multi-perspective Conditional Message Passing (CMP) encoding architecture to bridge the gap between textual and structural modalities, enabling their seamless integration. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic residual fusion module to selectively retain relevant textual information and a flexible edge scoring mechanism to adapt to diverse downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on 28 datasets demonstrate that MERRY outperforms existing baselines in most scenarios, showcasing strong reasoning capabilities within KGs and excellent generalization to out-of-KG tasks such as KGQA.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Symbolic Foundation Regressor on Complex Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21879v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In science, we are interested not only in forecasting but also in understanding how predictions are made, specifically what the interpretable underlying model looks like. Data-driven machine learning technology can significantly streamline the complex and time-consuming traditional manual process of discovering scientific laws, helping us gain insights into fundamental issues in modern science. In this work, we introduce a pre-trained symbolic foundation regressor that can effectively compress complex data with numerous interacting variables while producing interpretable physical representations. Our model has been rigorously tested on non-network symbolic regression, symbolic regression on complex networks, and the inference of network dynamics across various domains, including physics, biochemistry, ecology, and epidemiology. The results indicate a remarkable improvement in equation inference efficiency, being three times more effective than baseline approaches while maintaining accurate predictions. Furthermore, we apply our model to uncover more intuitive laws of interaction transmission from global epidemic outbreak data, achieving optimal data fitting. This model extends the application boundary of pre-trained symbolic regression models to complex networks, and we believe it provides a foundational solution for revealing the hidden mechanisms behind changes in complex phenomena, enhancing interpretability, and inspiring further scientific discoveries.</p></details> | 60 pages |
| **[Revisiting Bayesian Model Averaging in the Era of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21857v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the classical, full-fledged Bayesian model averaging (BMA) paradigm to ensemble pre-trained and/or lightly-finetuned foundation models to enhance the classification performance on image and text data. To make BMA tractable under foundation models, we introduce trainable linear classifiers that take frozen features from the pre-trained foundation models as inputs. The model posteriors over the linear classifiers tell us which linear heads and frozen features are better suited for a given dataset, resulting in a principled model ensembling method. Furthermore, we propose a computationally cheaper, optimizable model averaging scheme (OMA). In OMA, we directly optimize the model ensemble weights, just like those weights based on model posterior distributions in BMA, by reducing the amount of surprise (expected entropy of the predictions) we get from predictions of ensembled models. With the rapid development of foundation models, these approaches will enable the incorporation of future, possibly significantly better foundation models to enhance the performance of challenging classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Time Series Foundation Models are Stronger Zero-Shot Forecaster](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07649v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs) have recently become prevalent for time series forecasting tasks. While fine-tuning LLMs enables domain adaptation, they often struggle to generalize across diverse and unseen datasets. Moreover, existing Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) still face challenges in handling non-stationary dynamics and distribution shifts, largely due to the lack of effective mechanisms for adaptation. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for time series forecasting that enhances the generalization and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant segments from a dedicated knowledge base, enriching the contextual representation of the input query. Furthermore, we propose an Adaptive Retrieval Mixer (ARM) module that dynamically fuses the retrieved patterns with the TSFM's internal representation, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming the existing TSFMs by up to 6.84% across diverse domains while also providing desirable interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaX: Boosting Low-Rank Training of Foundation Models via Latent Crossing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21732v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training foundation models such as ViTs and LLMs requires tremendous computing cost. Low-rank matrix or tensor factorization offers a parameter-efficient alternative, but often downgrades performance due to the restricted parameter space. In this work, we introduce {\textbf{Latent Crossing (LaX)}} -- a simple yet effective plug-and-play module that enhances the capacity of low-rank models by enabling information flow across low-rank subspaces. We extensively validate the benefits of LaX on pre-training tasks with ViT-Base/Large and LLaMA-like models ranging from 60M to 1B parameters. LaX boosts low-rank model performance to match or exceed the full-rank baselines while using 2-3\(\times\) fewer parameters. When equipped with low-rank adapters (i.e., LoRA) for fine-tuning LLaMA-7/13B, LaX consistently improves performance on arithmetic and common sense reasoning tasks with negligible cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedBridge: Bridging Foundation Vision-Language Models to Medical Image Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21698v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision-language foundation models deliver state-of-the-art results on natural image classification but falter on medical images due to pronounced domain shifts. At the same time, training a medical foundation model requires substantial resources, including extensive annotated data and high computational capacity. To bridge this gap with minimal overhead, we introduce MedBridge, a lightweight multimodal adaptation framework that re-purposes pretrained VLMs for accurate medical image diagnosis. MedBridge comprises three key components. First, a Focal Sampling module that extracts high-resolution local regions to capture subtle pathological features and compensate for the limited input resolution of general-purpose VLMs. Second, a Query Encoder (QEncoder) injects a small set of learnable queries that attend to the frozen feature maps of VLM, aligning them with medical semantics without retraining the entire backbone. Third, a Mixture of Experts mechanism, driven by learnable queries, harnesses the complementary strength of diverse VLMs to maximize diagnostic performance. We evaluate MedBridge on five medical imaging benchmarks across three key adaptation tasks, demonstrating its superior performance in both cross-domain and in-domain adaptation settings, even under varying levels of training data availability. Notably, MedBridge achieved over 6-15% improvement in AUC compared to state-of-the-art VLM adaptation methods in multi-label thoracic disease diagnosis, underscoring its effectiveness in leveraging foundation models for accurate and data-efficient medical diagnosis. Our code is available at https://github.com/ai-med/MedBridge.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Structured Unplugged Approach for Foundational AI Literacy in Primary Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21398v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Younger generations are growing up in a world increasingly shaped by intelligent technologies, making early AI literacy crucial for developing the skills to critically understand and navigate them. However, education in this field often emphasizes tool-based learning, prioritizing usage over understanding the underlying concepts. This lack of knowledge leaves non-experts, especially children, prone to misconceptions, unrealistic expectations, and difficulties in recognizing biases and stereotypes. In this paper, we propose a structured and replicable teaching approach that fosters foundational AI literacy in primary students, by building upon core mathematical elements closely connected to and of interest in primary curricula, to strengthen conceptualization, data representation, classification reasoning, and evaluation of AI. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted an empirical study with thirty-one fifth-grade students across two classes, evaluating their progress through a post-test and a satisfaction survey. Our results indicate improvements in terminology understanding and usage, features description, logical reasoning, and evaluative skills, with students showing a deeper comprehension of decision-making processes and their limitations. Moreover, the approach proved engaging, with students particularly enjoying activities that linked AI concepts to real-world reasoning.

| **[Foundation Models on a Budget: Approximating Blocks in Large Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04941v5)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models have shown impressive performance in various tasks and domains, yet they require massive computational resources, raising concerns about accessibility and sustainability. Previous attempts to reduce foundation model size fall short of fully addressing the problem, as they end up increasing computational load through additional training steps. Recent works reveal that deep neural networks exhibit internal representation similarities. While inter-network similarities have enabled techniques such as model stitching and merging, intra-network similarities remain underexplored for improving efficiency. In this paper, we propose Transformer Blocks Approximation (TBA), a novel method that leverages intra-network similarities to identify and approximate transformer blocks in large vision models. TBA replaces these blocks using lightweight, closed-form transformations, without retraining or fine-tuning the rest of the model. The proposed method reduces the number of parameters while having minimal impact on the downstream task. We validate the effectiveness and generalizability of TBA through extensive experiments across multiple datasets (e.g., Imagenet-1k and CIFAR100) and state-of-the-art pretrained vision models (e.g, ViT, DiNO-v2, and DEiT).</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 14 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |
| **[DeCAF: Decentralized Consensus-And-Factorization for Low-Rank Adaptation of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21382v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most effective, computationally tractable fine-tuning approaches for training Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). LoRA accomplishes this by freezing the pre-trained model weights and injecting trainable low-rank matrices, allowing for efficient learning of these foundation models even on edge devices. However, LoRA in decentralized settings still remains under explored, particularly for the theoretical underpinnings due to the lack of smoothness guarantee and model consensus interference (defined formally below). This work improves the convergence rate of decentralized LoRA (DLoRA) to match the rate of decentralized SGD by ensuring gradient smoothness. We also introduce DeCAF, a novel algorithm integrating DLoRA with truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD)-based matrix factorization to resolve consensus interference. Theoretical analysis shows TSVD's approximation error is bounded and consensus differences between DLoRA and DeCAF vanish as rank increases, yielding DeCAF's matching convergence rate. Extensive experiments across vision/language tasks demonstrate our algorithms outperform local training and rivals federated learning under both IID and non-IID data distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Securing Federated Learning against Backdoor Threats with Foundation Model Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17573v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training while preserving privacy. Recently, the integration of Foundation Models (FMs) into FL has enhanced performance but introduced a novel backdoor attack mechanism. Attackers can exploit FM vulnerabilities to embed backdoors into synthetic data generated by FMs. During global model fusion, these backdoors are transferred to the global model through compromised synthetic data, subsequently infecting all client models. Existing FL backdoor defenses are ineffective against this novel attack due to its fundamentally different mechanism compared to classic ones. In this work, we propose a novel data-free defense strategy that addresses both classic and novel backdoor attacks in FL. The shared attack pattern lies in the abnormal activations within the hidden feature space during model aggregation. Hence, we propose to constrain internal activations to remain within reasonable ranges, effectively mitigating attacks while preserving model functionality. The activation constraints are optimized using synthetic data alongside FL training. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness against both novel and classic backdoor attacks, outperforming existing defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to IEEE IRI 2025</p></details> |

Our approach features a unique "small-to-large" design. A compact "seed" model containing a few Conformer or Transformer blocks is trained and unfolded many times to emulate the performance of larger uncompressed models with different logical depths. The seed model and many unfolded paths are jointly trained within a single unfolding cycle. The KL-divergence between the largest unfolded and smallest seed models is used in a self-distillation process to minimize their performance disparity. Experimental results show that our foldable model produces ASR performance comparable to individually constructed Conformer and wav2vec2/HuBERT speech foundation models under various depth configurations, while requiring only minimal memory and storage. Conformer and wav2vec2 models with a reduction of 35% and 30% parameters are obtained without loss of performance, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech2025</p></details> |

We introduce SoniDo, a music foundation model (MFM) designed to extract hierarchical features from target music samples. By leveraging hierarchical intermediate features, SoniDo constrains the information granularity, leading to improved performance across various downstream tasks including both understanding and generative tasks. We specifically evaluated this approach on representative tasks such as music tagging, music transcription, music source separation, and music mixing. Our results reveal that the features extracted from foundation models provide valuable enhancements in training downstream task models. This highlights the capability of using features extracted from music foundation models as a booster for downstream tasks. Our approach not only benefits existing task-specific models but also supports music downstream tasks constrained by data scarcity. This paves the way for more effective and accessible music processing solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages with 14 figures</p></details> |
| **[FM-Planner: Foundation Model Guided Path Planning for Autonomous Drone Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20783v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Path planning is a critical component in autonomous drone operations, enabling safe and efficient navigation through complex environments. Recent advances in foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have opened new opportunities for enhanced perception and intelligent decision-making in robotics. However, their practical applicability and effectiveness in global path planning remain relatively unexplored. This paper proposes foundation model-guided path planners (FM-Planner) and presents a comprehensive benchmarking study and practical validation for drone path planning. Specifically, we first systematically evaluate eight representative LLM and VLM approaches using standardized simulation scenarios. To enable effective real-time navigation, we then design an integrated LLM-Vision planner that combines semantic reasoning with visual perception. Furthermore, we deploy and validate the proposed path planner through real-world experiments under multiple configurations. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths, limitations, and feasibility of deploying foundation models in real-world drone applications and providing practical implementations in autonomous flight.

| **[Generalized and Personalized Federated Learning with Foundation Models via Orthogonal Transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19888v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) aims to train models across decentralized clients or devices holding local data without the need for centralized data collection, thus enhancing data privacy and security. However, achieving both generalization and personalization in heterogeneous settings remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce FedOT, a novel approach that leverages black-box foundation models. FedOT shares only a global task-dependent classifier across clients while locally adapting features through orthogonal transformations. By enforcing orthogonality, FedOT mitigates gradient conflicts across diverse clients, preserves semantic integrity, and achieves robust performance even in the presence of substantial data heterogeneity. The strategy of combining global and local parameters enables a more balanced approach for both generalization and personalization, outperforming baseline FL methods across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, our extensive analysis confirms that joint optimization of global classifiers and local orthogonal transformations yields superior performance and suggests broader applicability.</p></details> | 27 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Towards Pretraining Robust ASR Foundation Model with Acoustic-Aware Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20606v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whisper's robust performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR) is often attributed to its massive 680k-hour training set, an impractical scale for most researchers. In this work, we examine how linguistic and acoustic diversity in training data affect the robustness of the ASR model and reveal that transcription generalization is primarily driven by acoustic variation rather than linguistic richness. We find that targeted acoustic augmentation methods could significantly improve the generalization ability of ASR models, reducing word-error rates by up to 19.24 percent on unseen datasets when training on the 960-hour Librispeech dataset. These findings highlight strategic acoustically focused data augmentation as a promising alternative to massive datasets for building robust ASR models, offering a potential solution to future foundation ASR models when massive human speech data is lacking.</p></details> | in submission |
| **[CPathAgent: An Agent-based Foundation Model for Interpretable High-Resolution Pathology Image Analysis Mimicking Pathologists' Diagnostic Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20510v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computational pathology have led to the emergence of numerous foundation models. However, these approaches fail to replicate the diagnostic process of pathologists, as they either simply rely on general-purpose encoders with multi-instance learning for classification or directly apply multimodal models to generate reports from images. A significant limitation is their inability to emulate the diagnostic logic employed by pathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification for overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate comprehensive diagnoses. To address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an innovative agent-based model that mimics pathologists' reasoning processes by autonomously executing zoom-in/out and navigation operations across pathology images based on observed visual features. To achieve this, we develop a multi-stage training strategy unifying patch-level, region-level, and whole-slide capabilities within a single model, which is essential for mimicking pathologists, who require understanding and reasoning capabilities across all three scales. This approach generates substantially more detailed and interpretable diagnostic reports compared to existing methods, particularly for huge region understanding. Additionally, we construct an expert-validated PathMMU-HR$^{2}$, the first benchmark for huge region analysis, a critical intermediate scale between patches and whole slides, as diagnosticians typically examine several key regions rather than entire slides at once. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms existing approaches across three scales of benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a promising direction for the future development of computational pathology.</p></details> | 49 pages, 33 figures |
| **[Embodied AI with Foundation Models for Mobile Service Robots: A Systematic Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20503v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid advancements in foundation models, including Large Language Models, Vision-Language Models, Multimodal Large Language Models, and Vision-Language-Action Models have opened new avenues for embodied AI in mobile service robotics. By combining foundation models with the principles of embodied AI, where intelligent systems perceive, reason, and act through physical interactions, robots can improve understanding, adapt to, and execute complex tasks in dynamic real-world environments. However, embodied AI in mobile service robots continues to face key challenges, including multimodal sensor fusion, real-time decision-making under uncertainty, task generalization, and effective human-robot interactions (HRI). In this paper, we present the first systematic review of the integration of foundation models in mobile service robotics, identifying key open challenges in embodied AI and examining how foundation models can address them. Namely, we explore the role of such models in enabling real-time sensor fusion, language-conditioned control, and adaptive task execution. Furthermore, we discuss real-world applications in the domestic assistance, healthcare, and service automation sectors, demonstrating the transformative impact of foundation models on service robotics. We also include potential future research directions, emphasizing the need for predictive scaling laws, autonomous long-term adaptation, and cross-embodiment generalization to enable scalable, efficient, and robust deployment of foundation models in human-centric robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SEMMA: A Semantic Aware Knowledge Graph Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20422v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) have shown promise in enabling zero-shot reasoning over unseen graphs by learning transferable patterns. However, most existing KGFMs rely solely on graph structure, overlooking the rich semantic signals encoded in textual attributes. We introduce SEMMA, a dual-module KGFM that systematically integrates transferable textual semantics alongside structure. SEMMA leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich relation identifiers, generating semantic embeddings that subsequently form a textual relation graph, which is fused with the structural component. Across 54 diverse KGs, SEMMA outperforms purely structural baselines like ULTRA in fully inductive link prediction. Crucially, we show that in more challenging generalization settings, where the test-time relation vocabulary is entirely unseen, structural methods collapse while SEMMA is 2x more effective. Our findings demonstrate that textual semantics are critical for generalization in settings where structure alone fails, highlighting the need for foundation models that unify structural and linguistic signals in knowledge reasoning.</p></details> |  |
