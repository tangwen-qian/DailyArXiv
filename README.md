| **[SpatialReasoner: Towards Explicit and Generalizable 3D Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20024v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in 3D spatial reasoning explore data-driven approaches and achieve enhanced spatial reasoning performance with reinforcement learning (RL). However, these methods typically perform spatial reasoning in an implicit manner, and it remains underexplored whether the acquired 3D knowledge generalizes to unseen question types at any stage of the training. In this work we introduce SpatialReasoner, a novel large vision-language model (LVLM) that address 3D spatial reasoning with explicit 3D representations shared between stages -- 3D perception, computation, and reasoning. Explicit 3D representations provide a coherent interface that supports advanced 3D spatial reasoning and enable us to study the factual errors made by LVLMs. Results show that our SpatialReasoner achieve improved performance on a variety of spatial reasoning benchmarks and generalizes better when evaluating on novel 3D spatial reasoning questions. Our study bridges the 3D parsing capabilities of prior visual foundation models with the powerful reasoning abilities of large language models, opening new directions for 3D spatial reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://spatial-reasoner.github.io</p></details> |
| **[STCOcc: Sparse Spatial-Temporal Cascade Renovation for 3D Occupancy and Scene Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19749v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D occupancy and scene flow offer a detailed and dynamic representation of 3D scene. Recognizing the sparsity and complexity of 3D space, previous vision-centric methods have employed implicit learning-based approaches to model spatial and temporal information. However, these approaches struggle to capture local details and diminish the model's spatial discriminative ability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel explicit state-based modeling method designed to leverage the occupied state to renovate the 3D features. Specifically, we propose a sparse occlusion-aware attention mechanism, integrated with a cascade refinement strategy, which accurately renovates 3D features with the guidance of occupied state information. Additionally, we introduce a novel method for modeling long-term dynamic interactions, which reduces computational costs and preserves spatial information. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods, our efficient explicit renovation strategy not only delivers superior performance in terms of RayIoU and mAVE for occupancy and scene flow prediction but also markedly reduces GPU memory usage during training, bringing it down to 8.7GB.

| **[GPA-RAM: Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba for Spatial Task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19683v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing robot manipulation methods prioritize task learning by enhancing perception through complex deep network architectures. However, they face challenges in real-time collision-free planning. Hence, Robotic Attention Mamba (RAM) is designed for refined planning. Specifically, by integrating Mamba and parallel single-view attention, RAM aligns multi-view vision and task-related language features, ensuring efficient fine-grained task planning with linear complexity and robust real-time performance. Nevertheless, it has the potential for further improvement in high-precision grasping and manipulation. Thus, Grasp-Pretraining Augmentation (GPA) is devised, with a grasp pose feature extractor pretrained utilizing object grasp poses directly inherited from whole-task demonstrations. Subsequently, the extracted grasp features are fused with the spatially aligned planning features from RAM through attention-based Pre-trained Location Fusion, preserving high-resolution grasping cues overshadowed by an overemphasis on global planning. To summarize, we propose Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba (GPA-RAM), dividing spatial task learning into RAM for planning skill learning and GPA for grasping skill learning. GPA-RAM demonstrates superior performance across three robot systems with distinct camera configurations in simulation and the real world. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, it improves the absolute success rate by 8.2% (from 79.3% to 87.5%) on the RLBench multi-task benchmark and 40\% (from 16% to 56%), 12% (from 86% to 98%) on the ALOHA bimanual manipulation tasks, while delivering notably faster inference. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that both RAM and GPA enhance task learning, with GPA proving robust to different architectures of pretrained grasp pose feature extractors.

| **[Generalizing Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods to probe for spatial correlations in temporal networks and infer their topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16070v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motifs are thought to be some fundamental components of social face-to-face interaction temporal networks. However, the motifs previously considered are either limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles, which are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of social systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these triangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be mined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the edge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods motifs of the literature. We also confirm in empirical data that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to the Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show how mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for spatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that network. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the edge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions. In the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the edge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network they were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development, that we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bullet: Boosting GPU Utilization for LLM Serving via Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Orchestration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19516v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern LLM serving systems confront inefficient GPU utilization due to the fundamental mismatch between compute-intensive prefill and memory-bound decode phases. While current practices attempt to address this by organizing these phases into hybrid batches, such solutions create an inefficient tradeoff that sacrifices either throughput or latency, leaving substantial GPU resources underutilized. We identify two key root causes: 1) the prefill phase suffers from suboptimal compute utilization due to wave quantization and attention bottlenecks. 2) hybrid batches disproportionately prioritize latency over throughput, resulting in wasted compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate the issues, we present Bullet, a novel spatial-temporal orchestration system that eliminates these inefficiencies through precise phase coordination. Bullet enables concurrent execution of prefill and decode phases, while dynamically provisioning GPU resources using real-time performance modeling. By integrating SLO-aware scheduling and adaptive resource allocation, Bullet maximizes utilization without compromising latency targets. Experimental evaluations on real-world workloads demonstrate that Bullet delivers 1.26x average throughput gains (up to 1.55x) over state-of-the-arts, while consistently meeting latency constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Frequency Domain Resampling for Gridded Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19337v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In frequency domain analysis for spatial data, spectral averages based on the periodogram often play an important role in understanding spatial covariance structure, but also have complicated sampling distributions due to complex variances from aggregated periodograms. In order to nonparametrically approximate these sampling distributions for purposes of inference, resampling can be useful, but previous developments in spatial bootstrap have faced challenges in the scope of their validity, specifically due to issues in capturing the complex variances of spatial spectral averages. As a consequence, existing frequency domain bootstraps for spatial data are highly restricted in application to only special processes (e.g. Gaussian) or certain spatial statistics. To address this limitation and to approximate a wide range of spatial spectral averages, we propose a practical hybrid-resampling approach that combines two different resampling techniques in the forms of spatial subsampling and spatial bootstrap. Subsampling helps to capture the variance of spectral averages while bootstrap captures the distributional shape. The hybrid resampling procedure can then accurately quantify uncertainty in spectral inference under mild spatial assumptions. Moreover, compared to the more studied time series setting, this work fills a gap in the theory of subsampling/bootstrap for spatial data regarding spectral average statistics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Sign based High dimensional Change Point Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19306v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional changepoint inference, adaptable to diverse alternative scenarios, has attracted significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose an adaptive and robust approach to changepoint testing. Specifically, by generalizing the classical mean-based cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistic, we construct CUSUM statistics based on spatial medians and spatial signs. We introduce test statistics that consider the maximum and summation of the CUSUM statistics across different dimensions, respectively, and take the maximum across all potential changepoint locations. The asymptotic distributions of test statistics under the null hypothesis are derived. Furthermore, the test statistics exhibit asymptotic independence under mild conditions. Building on these results, we propose an adaptive testing procedure that combines the max-$L_\infty$-type and max-$L_2$-type statistics to achieve high power under both sparse and dense alternatives. Through numerical experiments and theoretical analysis, the proposed method demonstrates strong performance and exhibits robustness across a wide range of signal sparsity levels and heavy-tailed distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[RadioFormer: A Multiple-Granularity Radio Map Estimation Transformer with 1\textpertenthousand Spatial Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19161v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of radio map estimation aims to generate a dense representation of electromagnetic spectrum quantities, such as the received signal strength at each grid point within a geographic region, based on measurements from a subset of spatially distributed nodes (represented as pixels). Recently, deep vision models such as the U-Net have been adapted to radio map estimation, whose effectiveness can be guaranteed with sufficient spatial observations (typically 0.01% to 1% of pixels) in each map, to model local dependency of observed signal power. However, such a setting of sufficient measurements can be less practical in real-world scenarios, where extreme sparsity in spatial sampling can be widely encountered. To address this challenge, we propose RadioFormer, a novel multiple-granularity transformer designed to handle the constraints posed by spatial sparse observations. Our RadioFormer, through a dual-stream self-attention (DSA) module, can respectively discover the correlation of pixel-wise observed signal power and also learn patch-wise buildings' geometries in a style of multiple granularities, which are integrated into multi-scale representations of radio maps by a cross stream cross-attention (CCA) module. Extensive experiments on the public RadioMapSeer dataset demonstrate that RadioFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in radio map estimation while maintaining the lowest computational cost. Furthermore, the proposed approach exhibits exceptional generalization capabilities and robust zero-shot performance, underscoring its potential to advance radio map estimation in a more practical setting with very limited observation nodes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse VideoGen: Accelerating Video Diffusion Transformers with Spatial-Temporal Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01776v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) dominate video generation but their high computational cost severely limits real-world applicability, usually requiring tens of minutes to generate a few seconds of video even on high-performance GPUs. This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational complexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that leverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference efficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified into two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where only spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output, and (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different frames dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling strategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of attention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout transformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x and 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively, while preserving generation quality. Our code is open-sourced and is available at https://github.com/svg-project/Sparse-VideoGen</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adaptation using spatially distributed Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14130v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the accuracy of an approximate posterior distribution in nonparametric regression problems by combining posterior distributions computed on subsets of the data defined by the locations of the independent variables. We show that this approximate posterior retains the rate of recovery of the full data posterior distribution, where the rate of recovery adapts to the smoothness of the true regression function. As particular examples we consider Gaussian process priors based on integrated Brownian motion and the Mat\'ern kernel augmented with a prior on the length scale. Besides theoretical guarantees we present a numerical study of the methods both on synthetic and real world data. We also propose a new aggregation technique, which numerically outperforms previous approaches. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that spatially distributed methods can adapt to local regularities, potentially outperforming the original Gaussian process.</p></details> | 90 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Unified Approach for Multi-Granularity Search over Spatial Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04805v3)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been increased interest in data search as a means to find relevant datasets or data points in data lakes and repositories. Although approaches have been proposed to support spatial dataset search and data point search, they consider the two types of searches independently. To enable search operations ranging from the coarse-grained dataset level to the fine-grained data point level, we provide an integrated one that supports diverse query types and distance metrics. In this paper, we focus on designing a multi-granularity spatial data search system, called Spadas, that supports both dataset and data point search operations. To address the challenges of the high cost of indexing and susceptibility to outliers, we propose a unified index that can drastically improve query efficiency in various scenarios by organizing data reasonably and removing outliers in datasets. Moreover, to accelerate all data search operations, we propose a set of pruning mechanisms based on the unified index, including fast bound estimation, approximation technique with error bound, and pruning in batch techniques, to effectively filter out non-relevant datasets and points. Finally, we report the results of a detailed experimental evaluation using six spatial data repositories, achieving orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrating the effectiveness by case study. An online spatial data search system of Spadas is also implemented and made accessible to users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time High-fidelity Gaussian Human Avatars with Position-based Interpolation of Spatially Distributed MLPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12909v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many works have succeeded in reconstructing Gaussian human avatars from multi-view videos. However, they either struggle to capture pose-dependent appearance details with a single MLP, or rely on a computationally intensive neural network to reconstruct high-fidelity appearance but with rendering performance degraded to non-real-time. We propose a novel Gaussian human avatar representation that can reconstruct high-fidelity pose-dependence appearance with details and meanwhile can be rendered in real time. Our Gaussian avatar is empowered by spatially distributed MLPs which are explicitly located on different positions on human body. The parameters stored in each Gaussian are obtained by interpolating from the outputs of its nearby MLPs based on their distances. To avoid undesired smooth Gaussian property changing during interpolation, for each Gaussian we define a set of Gaussian offset basis, and a linear combination of basis represents the Gaussian property offsets relative to the neutral properties. Then we propose to let the MLPs output a set of coefficients corresponding to the basis. In this way, although Gaussian coefficients are derived from interpolation and change smoothly, the Gaussian offset basis is learned freely without constraints. The smoothly varying coefficients combined with freely learned basis can still produce distinctly different Gaussian property offsets, allowing the ability to learn high-frequency spatial signals. We further use control points to constrain the Gaussians distributed on a surface layer rather than allowing them to be irregularly distributed inside the body, to help the human avatar generalize better when animated under novel poses. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, our method achieves better appearance quality with finer details while the rendering speed is significantly faster under novel views and novel poses.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[LiLIS: Enhancing Big Spatial Data Processing with Lightweight Distributed Learned Index](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18883v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficient management of big spatial data is crucial for location-based services, particularly in smart cities. However, existing systems such as Simba and Sedona, which incorporate distributed spatial indexing, still incur substantial index construction overheads, rendering them far from optimal for real-time analytics. Recent studies demonstrate that learned indices can achieve high efficiency through well-designed machine learning models, but how to design a learned index for distributed spatial analytics remains unaddressed. In this paper, we present LiLIS, a Lightweight Distributed Learned Index for big spatial data. LiLIS combines machine-learned search strategies with spatial-aware partitioning within a distributed framework, and efficiently implements common spatial queries, including point query, range query, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and spatial joins. Extensive experimental results over real-world and synthetic datasets show that LiLIS outperforms state-of-the-art big spatial data analytics by $2-3$ orders of magnitude for most spatial queries, and the index building achieves $1.5-2\times$ speed-up. The code is available at https://github.com/SWUFE-DB-Group/learned-index-spark.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoConformal prediction: a model-agnostic framework of measuring the uncertainty of spatial prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08661v3)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial prediction is a fundamental task in geography. In recent years, with advances in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), numerous models have been developed to improve the accuracy of geographic variable predictions. Beyond achieving higher accuracy, it is equally important to obtain predictions with uncertainty measures to enhance model credibility and support responsible spatial prediction. Although geostatistic methods like Kriging offer some level of uncertainty assessment, such as Kriging variance, these measurements are not always accurate and lack general applicability to other spatial models. To address this issue, we propose a model-agnostic uncertainty assessment method called GeoConformal Prediction, which incorporates geographical weighting into conformal prediction. We applied it to two classic spatial prediction cases, spatial regression and spatial interpolation, to evaluate its reliability. First, in the spatial regression case, we used XGBoost to predict housing prices, followed by GeoConformal to calculate uncertainty. Our results show that GeoConformal achieved a coverage rate of 93.67%, while Bootstrap methods only reached a maximum coverage of 81.00% after 2000 runs. Next, we applied GeoConformal to spatial interpolation models. We found that the uncertainty obtained from GeoConformal aligned closely with the variance in Kriging. Finally, using GeoConformal, we analyzed the sources of uncertainty in spatial prediction. We found that explicitly including local features in AI models can significantly reduce prediction uncertainty, especially in areas with strong local dependence. Our findings suggest that GeoConformal holds potential not only for geographic knowledge discovery but also for guiding the design of future GeoAI models, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable spatial prediction frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Speech Translation: Translating Across Space With Binaural Hearables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18715v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imagine being in a crowded space where people speak a different language and having hearables that transform the auditory space into your native language, while preserving the spatial cues for all speakers. We introduce spatial speech translation, a novel concept for hearables that translate speakers in the wearer's environment, while maintaining the direction and unique voice characteristics of each speaker in the binaural output. To achieve this, we tackle several technical challenges spanning blind source separation, localization, real-time expressive translation, and binaural rendering to preserve the speaker directions in the translated audio, while achieving real-time inference on the Apple M2 silicon. Our proof-of-concept evaluation with a prototype binaural headset shows that, unlike existing models, which fail in the presence of interference, we achieve a BLEU score of up to 22.01 when translating between languages, despite strong interference from other speakers in the environment. User studies further confirm the system's effectiveness in spatially rendering the translated speech in previously unseen real-world reverberant environments. Taking a step back, this work marks the first step towards integrating spatial perception into speech translation.</p></details> | Accepted by CHI2025 |
| **[SORT3D: Spatial Object-centric Reasoning Toolbox for Zero-Shot 3D Grounding Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18684v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpreting object-referential language and grounding objects in 3D with spatial relations and attributes is essential for robots operating alongside humans. However, this task is often challenging due to the diversity of scenes, large number of fine-grained objects, and complex free-form nature of language references. Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of natural language training data is difficult. Thus, it is important for methods to learn from little data and zero-shot generalize to new environments. To address these challenges, we propose SORT3D, an approach that utilizes rich object attributes from 2D data and merges a heuristics-based spatial reasoning toolbox with the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform sequential reasoning. Importantly, our method does not require text-to-3D data for training and can be applied zero-shot to unseen environments. We show that SORT3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex view-dependent grounding tasks on two benchmarks. We also implement the pipeline to run real-time on an autonomous vehicle and demonstrate that our approach can be used for object-goal navigation on previously unseen real-world environments. All source code for the system pipeline is publicly released at https://github.com/nzantout/SORT3D .</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Audio Processing with Large Language Model on Wearable Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08907v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating spatial context into large language models (LLMs) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, particularly in wearable devices. In this work, we present a novel system architecture that incorporates spatial speech understanding into LLMs, enabling contextually aware and adaptive applications for wearable technologies. Our approach leverages microstructure-based spatial sensing to extract precise Direction of Arrival (DoA) information using a monaural microphone. To address the lack of existing dataset for microstructure-assisted speech recordings, we synthetically create a dataset called OmniTalk by using the LibriSpeech dataset. This spatial information is fused with linguistic embeddings from OpenAI's Whisper model, allowing each modality to learn complementary contextual representations. The fused embeddings are aligned with the input space of LLaMA-3.2 3B model and fine-tuned with lightweight adaptation technique LoRA to optimize for on-device processing. SING supports spatially-aware automatic speech recognition (ASR), achieving a mean error of $25.72^\circ$-a substantial improvement compared to the 88.52$^\circ$ median error in existing work-with a word error rate (WER) of 5.3. SING also supports soundscaping, for example, inference how many people were talking and their directions, with up to 5 people and a median DoA error of 16$^\circ$. Our system demonstrates superior performance in spatial speech understanding while addressing the challenges of power efficiency, privacy, and hardware constraints, paving the way for advanced applications in augmented reality, accessibility, and immersive experiences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reasoner: A 3D Inference Pipeline for XR Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18380v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern extended reality XR systems provide rich analysis of image data and fusion of sensor input and demand AR/VR applications that can reason about 3D scenes in a semantic manner. We present a spatial reasoning framework that bridges geometric facts with symbolic predicates and relations to handle key tasks such as determining how 3D objects are arranged among each other ('on', 'behind', 'near', etc.). Its foundation relies on oriented 3D bounding box representations, enhanced by a comprehensive set of spatial predicates, ranging from topology and connectivity to directionality and orientation, expressed in a formalism related to natural language. The derived predicates form a spatial knowledge graph and, in combination with a pipeline-based inference model, enable spatial queries and dynamic rule evaluation. Implementations for client- and server-side processing demonstrate the framework's capability to efficiently translate geometric data into actionable knowledge, ensuring scalable and technology-independent spatial reasoning in complex 3D environments. The Spatial Reasoner framework is fostering the creation of spatial ontologies, and seamlessly integrates with and therefore enriches machine learning, natural language processing, and rule systems in XR applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, preprint of ICVARS 2025 paper</p></details> |
| **[Generating ensembles of spatially-coherent in-situ forecasts using flow matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03463v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a machine-learning-based methodology for in-situ weather forecast postprocessing that is both spatially coherent and multivariate. Compared to previous work, our Flow MAtching Postprocessing (FMAP) better represents the correlation structures of the observations distribution, while also improving marginal performance at the stations. FMAP generates forecasts that are not bound to what is already modeled by the underlying gridded prediction and can infer new correlation structures from data. The resulting model can generate an arbitrary number of forecasts from a limited number of numerical simulations, allowing for low-cost forecasting systems. A single training is sufficient to perform postprocessing at multiple lead times, in contrast with other methods which use multiple trained networks at generation time. This work details our methodology, including a spatial attention transformer backbone trained within a flow matching generative modeling framework. FMAP shows promising performance in experiments on the EUPPBench dataset, forecasting surface temperature and wind gust values at station locations in western Europe up to five-day lead times.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Spatially-Aware Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17379v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising approach for weakly supervised classification in pathology using whole slide images (WSIs). However, conventional MIL methods such as Attention-Based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (ABMIL) typically disregard spatial interactions among patches that are crucial to pathological diagnosis. Recent advancements, such as Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), have incorporated spatial context and inter-patch relationships. However, it remains unclear whether explicitly modeling patch relationships yields similar performance gains in ABMIL, which relies solely on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). In contrast, TransMIL employs Transformer-based layers, introducing a fundamental architectural shift at the cost of substantially increased computational complexity. In this work, we enhance the ABMIL framework by integrating interaction-aware representations to address this question. Our proposed model, Global ABMIL (GABMIL), explicitly captures inter-instance dependencies while preserving computational efficiency. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets for tumor subtyping in breast and lung cancers demonstrate that GABMIL achieves up to a 7 percentage point improvement in AUPRC and a 5 percentage point increase in the Kappa score over ABMIL, with minimal or no additional computational overhead. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating patch interactions within MIL frameworks.

| **[RSRNav: Reasoning Spatial Relationship for Image-Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17991v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent image-goal navigation (ImageNav) methods learn a perception-action policy by separately capturing semantic features of the goal and egocentric images, then passing them to a policy network. However, challenges remain: (1) Semantic features often fail to provide accurate directional information, leading to superfluous actions, and (2) performance drops significantly when viewpoint inconsistencies arise between training and application. To address these challenges, we propose RSRNav, a simple yet effective method that reasons spatial relationships between the goal and current observations as navigation guidance. Specifically, we model the spatial relationship by constructing correlations between the goal and current observations, which are then passed to the policy network for action prediction. These correlations are progressively refined using fine-grained cross-correlation and direction-aware correlation for more precise navigation. Extensive evaluation of RSRNav on three benchmark datasets demonstrates superior navigation performance, particularly in the "user-matched goal" setting, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MSGCN: Multiplex Spatial Graph Convolution Network for Interlayer Link Weight Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17749v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for various learning tasks, ranging from node classification to link prediction. They have demonstrated excellent performance in multiple domains involving graph-structured data. However, an important category of learning tasks, namely link weight prediction, has received less emphasis due to its increased complexity compared to binary link classification. Link weight prediction becomes even more challenging when considering multilayer networks, where nodes can be interconnected across multiple layers. To address these challenges, we propose a new method named Multiplex Spatial Graph Convolution Network (MSGCN), which spatially embeds information across multiple layers to predict interlayer link weights. The MSGCN model generalizes spatial graph convolution to multiplex networks and captures the geometric structure of nodes across multiple layers. Extensive experiments using data with known interlayer link information show that the MSGCN model has robust, accurate, and generalizable link weight prediction performance across a wide variety of multiplex network structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Spatially-Lucid AI Classification in Non-Euclidean Space: An Application for MxIF Oncology Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14974v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given multi-category point sets from different place-types, our goal is to develop a spatially-lucid classifier that can distinguish between two classes based on the arrangements of their points. This problem is important for many applications, such as oncology, for analyzing immune-tumor relationships and designing new immunotherapies. It is challenging due to spatial variability and interpretability needs. Previously proposed techniques require dense training data or have limited ability to handle significant spatial variability within a single place-type. Most importantly, these deep neural network (DNN) approaches are not designed to work in non-Euclidean space, particularly point sets. Existing non-Euclidean DNN methods are limited to one-size-fits-all approaches. We explore a spatial ensemble framework that explicitly uses different training strategies, including weighted-distance learning rate and spatial domain adaptation, on various place-types for spatially-lucid classification. Experimental results on real-world datasets (e.g., MxIF oncology data) show that the proposed framework provides higher prediction accuracy than baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIAM ...</summary><p>SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM24)</p></details> |

While current deep learning methods have made significant advancements, challenges remain in achieving an optimal balance between accuracy, robustness, and inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose the StereoMamba architecture, which is specifically designed for stereo disparity estimation in RAMIS. Our approach is based on a novel Feature Extraction Mamba (FE-Mamba) module, which enhances long-range spatial dependencies both within and across stereo images. To effectively integrate multi-scale features from FE-Mamba, we then introduce a novel Multidimensional Feature Fusion (MFF) module. Experiments against the state-of-the-art on the ex-vivo SCARED benchmark demonstrate that StereoMamba achieves superior performance on EPE of 2.64 px and depth MAE of 2.55 mm, the second-best performance on Bad2 of 41.49% and Bad3 of 26.99%, while maintaining an inference speed of 21.28 FPS for a pair of high-resolution images (1280*1024), striking the optimum balance between accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. Furthermore, by comparing synthesized right images, generated from warping left images using the generated disparity maps, with the actual right image, StereoMamba achieves the best average SSIM (0.8970) and PSNR (16.0761), exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization on the in-vivo RIS2017 and StereoMIS datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPAARC: Spatial Proximity and Association based prefetching for Augmented Reality in edge Cache](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15192v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) applications face performance challenges due to their high computational demands and need for low-latency responses. Traditional approaches like on-device storage or reactive data fetching from the cloud often result in limited AR experiences or unacceptable lag. Edge caching, which caches AR objects closer to the user, provides a promising solution. However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific features such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location. This paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing AR-aware prefetching techniques. We present SPAARC, a Spatial Proximity and Association-based Prefetching policy specifically designed for MAR Caches. SPAARC intelligently prioritizes the caching of virtual objects based on their association with other similar objects and the user's proximity to them. It also considers the recency of associations and uses a lazy fetching strategy to efficiently manage edge resources and maximize Quality of Experience (QoE). Through extensive evaluation using both synthetic and real-world workloads, we demonstrate that SPAARC significantly improves cache hit rates compared to standard caching algorithms, achieving gains ranging from 3% to 40% while reducing the need for on-demand data retrieval from the cloud. Further, we present an adaptive tuning algorithm that automatically tunes SPAARC parameters to achieve optimal performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SPAARC to substantially enhance the user experience in MAR applications by ensuring the timely availability of virtual objects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generalizable Deepfake Detection with Spatial-Frequency Collaborative Learning and Hierarchical Cross-Modal Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17223v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of deep generative models poses a critical challenge to deepfake detection, as detectors trained on forgery-specific artifacts often suffer significant performance degradation when encountering unseen forgeries. While existing methods predominantly rely on spatial domain analysis, frequency domain operations are primarily limited to feature-level augmentation, leaving frequency-native artifacts and spatial-frequency interactions insufficiently exploited. To address this limitation, we propose a novel detection framework that integrates multi-scale spatial-frequency analysis for universal deepfake detection. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a local spectral feature extraction pipeline that combines block-wise discrete cosine transform with cascaded multi-scale convolutions to capture subtle spectral artifacts; (2) a global spectral feature extraction pipeline utilizing scale-invariant differential accumulation to identify holistic forgery distribution patterns; and (3) a multi-stage cross-modal fusion mechanism that incorporates shallow-layer attention enhancement and deep-layer dynamic modulation to model spatial-frequency interactions. Extensive evaluations on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods in both accuracy and generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially-Delineated Domain-Adapted AI Classification: An Application for Oncology Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11695v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given multi-type point maps from different place-types (e.g., tumor regions), our objective is to develop a classifier trained on the source place-type to accurately distinguish between two classes of the target place-type based on their point arrangements. This problem is societally important for many applications, such as generating clinical hypotheses for designing new immunotherapies for cancer treatment. The challenge lies in the spatial variability, the inherent heterogeneity and variation observed in spatial properties or arrangements across different locations (i.e., place-types). Previous techniques focus on self-supervised tasks to learn domain-invariant features and mitigate domain differences; however, they often neglect the underlying spatial arrangements among data points, leading to significant discrepancies across different place-types. We explore a novel multi-task self-learning framework that targets spatial arrangements, such as spatial mix-up masking and spatial contrastive predictive coding, for spatially-delineated domain-adapted AI classification. Experimental results on real-world datasets (e.g., oncology data) show that the proposed framework provides higher prediction accuracy than baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Function-on-Function Regression for Spatial Functional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08175v3)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial functional data arise in many settings, such as particulate matter curves observed at monitoring stations and age population curves at each areal unit. Most existing functional regression models have limited applicability because they do not consider spatial correlations. Although functional kriging methods can predict the curves at unobserved spatial locations, they are based on variogram fittings rather than constructing hierarchical statistical models. In this manuscript, we propose a Bayesian framework for spatial function-on-function regression that can carry out parameter estimations and predictions. However, the proposed model has computational and inferential challenges because the model needs to account for within and between-curve dependencies. Furthermore, high-dimensional and spatially correlated parameters can lead to the slow mixing of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. To address these issues, we first utilize a basis transformation approach to simplify the covariance and apply projection methods for dimension reduction. We also develop a simultaneous band score for the proposed model to detect the significant region in the regression function. We apply our method to both areal and point-level spatial functional data, showing the proposed method is computationally efficient and provides accurate estimations and predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Delayed Acceptance Auxiliary Variable MCMC for Spatial Models with Intractable Likelihood Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17147v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large class of spatial models contains intractable normalizing functions, such as spatial lattice models, interaction spatial point processes, and social network models. Bayesian inference for such models is challenging since the resulting posterior distribution is doubly intractable. Although auxiliary variable MCMC (AVM) algorithms are known to be the most practical, they are computationally expensive due to the repeated auxiliary variable simulations. To address this, we propose delayed-acceptance AVM (DA-AVM) methods, which can reduce the number of auxiliary variable simulations. The first stage of the kernel uses a cheap surrogate to decide whether to accept or reject the proposed parameter value. The second stage guarantees detailed balance with respect to the posterior. The auxiliary variable simulation is performed only on the parameters accepted in the first stage. We construct various surrogates specifically tailored for doubly intractable problems, including subsampling strategy, Gaussian process emulation, and frequentist estimator-based approximation. We validate our method through simulated and real data applications, demonstrating its practicality for complex spatial models.</p></details> |  |

We explore various ways to integrate information from multiple subjects and show improved performance compared to standard CSP. Across three datasets, our method shows marginal improvements over standard CSP; however, when training data are limited, the improvements become more significant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Distribution-Shift Aware Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14840v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given inputs of diverse soil characteristics and climate data gathered from various regions, we aimed to build a model to predict accurate land emissions. The problem is important since accurate quantification of the carbon cycle in agroecosystems is crucial for mitigating climate change and ensuring sustainable food production. Predicting accurate land emissions is challenging since calibrating the heterogeneous nature of soil properties, moisture, and environmental conditions is hard at decision-relevant scales. Traditional approaches do not adequately estimate land emissions due to location-independent parameters failing to leverage the spatial heterogeneity and also require large datasets. To overcome these limitations, we proposed Spatial Distribution-Shift Aware Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (SDSA-KGML), which leverages location-dependent parameters that account for significant spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture from multiple sites within the same region. Experimental results demonstrate that SDSA-KGML models achieve higher local accuracy for the specified states in the Midwest Region.</p></details> |  |

However, its effectiveness in video recognition tasks is hampered by two main challenges. First, fast adversarial training for video models remains largely unexplored, which severely impedes its practical applications. Specifically, most video adversarial training methods are computationally costly, with long training times and high expenses. Second, existing methods struggle with the trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. To address these challenges, we introduce Video Fast Adversarial Training with Weak-to-Strong consistency (VFAT-WS), the first fast adversarial training method for video data. Specifically, VFAT-WS incorporates the following key designs: First, it integrates a straightforward yet effective temporal frequency augmentation (TF-AUG), and its spatial-temporal enhanced form STF-AUG, along with a single-step PGD attack to boost training efficiency and robustness. Second, it devises a weak-to-strong spatial-temporal consistency regularization, which seamlessly integrates the simpler TF-AUG and the more complex STF-AUG. Leveraging the consistency regularization, it steers the learning process from simple to complex augmentations. Both of them work together to achieve a better trade-off between clean accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 with both CNN and Transformer-based models demonstrate that VFAT-WS achieves great improvements in adversarial robustness and corruption robustness, while accelerating training by nearly 490%.</p></details> | <details><summary>After...</summary><p>After the submission of the paper, we realized that the study still has room for expansion.

Some research suggests that VLMs can exhibit humanlike scene understanding, while other investigations reveal difficulties in their ability to process relational information. To achieve widespread applicability, VLMs must perform reliably, yielding comparable competence across a wide variety of related tasks. We sought to test how reliable these architectures are at engaging in trivial spatial cognition, e.g., recognizing whether one object is left of another in an uncluttered scene. We developed a benchmark dataset -- TableTest -- whose images depict 3D scenes of objects arranged on a table, and used it to evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs. Results show that performance could be degraded by minor variations of prompts that use logically equivalent descriptions. These analyses suggest limitations in how VLMs may reason about spatial relations in real-world applications. They also reveal novel opportunities for bolstering image caption corpora for more efficient training and testing.</p></details> |  |

| **[Visual Place Cell Encoding: A Computational Model for Spatial Representation and Cognitive Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15953v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the Visual Place Cell Encoding (VPCE) model, a biologically inspired computational framework for simulating place cell-like activation using visual input. Drawing on evidence that visual landmarks play a central role in spatial encoding, the proposed VPCE model activates visual place cells by clustering high-dimensional appearance features extracted from images captured by a robot-mounted camera. Each cluster center defines a receptive field, and activation is computed based on visual similarity using a radial basis function. We evaluate whether the resulting activation patterns correlate with key properties of biological place cells, including spatial proximity, orientation alignment, and boundary differentiation. Experiments demonstrate that the VPCE can distinguish between visually similar yet spatially distinct locations and adapt to environment changes such as the insertion or removal of walls. These results suggest that structured visual input, even in the absence of motion cues or reward-driven learning, is sufficient to generate place-cell-like spatial representations and support biologically inspired cognitive mapping.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint leave-group-out cross-validation in Bayesian spatial models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15586v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-validation (CV) is a widely-used method of predictive assessment based on repeated model fits to different subsets of the available data. CV is applicable in a wide range of statistical settings. However, in cases where data are not exchangeable, the design of CV schemes should account for suspected correlation structures within the data. CV scheme designs include the selection of left-out blocks and the choice of scoring function for evaluating predictive performance. This paper focuses on the impact of two scoring strategies for block-wise CV applied to spatial models with Gaussian covariance structures. We investigate, through several experiments, whether evaluating the predictive performance of blocks of left-out observations jointly, rather than aggregating individual (pointwise) predictions, improves model selection performance. Extending recent findings for data with serial correlation (such as time-series data), our experiments suggest that joint scoring reduces the variability of CV estimates, leading to more reliable model selection, particularly when spatial dependence is strong and model differences are subtle.</p></details> |  |
| **[Location-Oriented Sound Event Localization and Detection with Spatial Mapping and Regression Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08365v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) combines the Sound Event Detection (SED) with the corresponding Direction Of Arrival (DOA). Recently, adopted event oriented multi-track methods affect the generality in polyphonic environments due to the limitation of the number of tracks. To enhance the generality in polyphonic environments, we propose Spatial Mapping and Regression Localization for SELD (SMRL-SELD). SMRL-SELD segments the 3D spatial space, mapping it to a 2D plane, and a new regression localization loss is proposed to help the results converge toward the location of the corresponding event. SMRL-SELD is location-oriented, allowing the model to learn event features based on orientation. Thus, the method enables the model to process polyphonic sounds regardless of the number of overlapping events. We conducted experiments on STARSS23 and STARSS22 datasets and our proposed SMRL-SELD outperforms the existing SELD methods in overall evaluation and polyphony environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAPTURe: Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Vision Language Models via Occluded Object Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15485v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing and reasoning about occluded (partially or fully hidden) objects is vital to understanding visual scenes, as occlusions frequently occur in real-world environments and act as obstacles for spatial comprehension. To test models' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which requires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs' ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty counting in images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data: https://github.com/atinpothiraj/CAPTURe</p></details> |

Current surrogate models fall short in the flexibility of point- or region-based predictions as the entire field reconstruction is required for each parameter setting, hence hindering the efficiency of parameter space exploration. Limitations exist in capturing physical attribute distributions and pinpointing optimal parameter configurations. In this work, we propose Explorable INR, a novel implicit neural representation-based surrogate model, designed to facilitate exploration and allow point-based spatial queries without computing full-scale field data. In addition, to further address computational bottlenecks of spatial exploration, we utilize probabilistic affine forms (PAFs) for uncertainty propagation through Explorable INR to obtain statistical summaries, facilitating various ensemble analysis and visualization tasks that are expensive with existing models. Furthermore, we reformulate the parameter exploration problem as optimization tasks using gradient descent and KL divergence minimization that ensures scalability. We demonstrate that the Explorable INR with the proposed approach for spatial and parameter exploration can significantly reduce computation and memory costs while providing effective ensemble analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)</p></details> |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies have exposed critical limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities. This deficiency in spatial reasoning significantly constrains MLLMs' ability to interact effectively with the physical world, thereby limiting their broader applications. We argue that spatial reasoning capabilities will not naturally emerge from merely scaling existing architectures and training methodologies. Instead, this challenge demands dedicated attention to fundamental modifications in the current MLLM development approach. In this position paper, we first establish a comprehensive framework for spatial reasoning within the context of MLLMs. We then elaborate on its pivotal role in real-world applications. Through systematic analysis, we examine how individual components of the current methodology-from training data to reasoning mechanisms-influence spatial reasoning capabilities. This examination reveals critical limitations while simultaneously identifying promising avenues for advancement. Our work aims to direct the AI research community's attention toward these crucial yet underexplored aspects. By highlighting these challenges and opportunities, we seek to catalyze progress toward achieving human-like spatial reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we introduce a novel task, 360V2SA, to generate spatial audio from 360-degree videos, specifically producing First-order Ambisonics (FOA) audio - a standard format for representing 3D spatial audio that captures sound directionality and enables realistic 3D audio reproduction. We first create Sphere360, a novel dataset tailored for this task that is curated from real-world data. We also design an efficient semi-automated pipeline for collecting and cleaning paired video-audio data. To generate spatial audio from 360-degree video, we propose a novel framework OmniAudio, which leverages self-supervised pre-training using both spatial audio data (in FOA format) and large-scale non-spatial data. Furthermore, OmniAudio features a dual-branch framework that utilizes both panoramic and FoV video inputs to capture comprehensive local and global information from 360-degree videos. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective metrics on Sphere360. Code and datasets will be released at https://github.com/liuhuadai/OmniAudio. The demo page is available at https://OmniAudio-360V2SA.github.io.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[Backdoor Defense in Diffusion Models via Spatial Attention Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18563v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models are increasingly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious modifications to the training data cause the model to generate unintended outputs when specific triggers are present. While classification models have seen extensive development of defense mechanisms, generative models remain largely unprotected due to their high-dimensional output space, which complicates the detection and mitigation of subtle perturbations. Defense strategies for diffusion models, in particular, remain under-explored. In this work, we propose Spatial Attention Unlearning (SAU), a novel technique for mitigating backdoor attacks in diffusion models. SAU leverages latent space manipulation and spatial attention mechanisms to isolate and remove the latent representation of backdoor triggers, ensuring precise and efficient removal of malicious effects. We evaluate SAU across various types of backdoor attacks, including pixel-based and style-based triggers, and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving 100% trigger removal accuracy. Furthermore, SAU achieves a CLIP score of 0.7023, outperforming existing methods while preserving the model's ability to generate high-quality, semantically aligned images. Our results show that SAU is a robust, scalable, and practical solution for securing text-to-image diffusion models against backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Segmentation with Noisy Labels via Spatially Correlated Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14795v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In semantic segmentation, the accuracy of models heavily depends on the high-quality annotations. However, in many practical scenarios such as medical imaging and remote sensing, obtaining true annotations is not straightforward and usually requires significant human labor. Relying on human labor often introduces annotation errors, including mislabeling, omissions, and inconsistency between annotators. In the case of remote sensing, differences in procurement time can lead to misaligned ground truth annotations. These label errors are not independently distributed, and instead usually appear in spatially connected regions where adjacent pixels are more likely to share the same errors. To address these issues, we propose an approximate Bayesian estimation based on a probabilistic model that assumes training data includes label errors, incorporating the tendency for these errors to occur with spatial correlations between adjacent pixels. Bayesian inference requires computing the posterior distribution of label errors, which becomes intractable when spatial correlations are present. We represent the correlation of label errors between adjacent pixels through a Gaussian distribution whose covariance is structured by a Kac-Murdock-Szeg\"{o} (KMS) matrix, solving the computational challenges. Through experiments on multiple segmentation tasks, we confirm that leveraging the spatial correlation of label errors significantly improves performance. Notably, in specific tasks such as lung segmentation, the proposed method achieves performance comparable to training with clean labels under moderate noise levels.

However, the high cost, limited coverage, and technical complexity of current ST technologies restrict their widespread use in clinical and research settings, making obtaining high-resolution transcriptomic profiles across large tissue areas challenging. Predicting ST from H\&E-stained histology images has emerged as a promising alternative to address these limitations but remains challenging due to the heterogeneous relationship between histomorphology and gene expression, which is affected by substantial variability across patients and tissue sections. In response, we propose PH2ST, a prompt-guided hypergraph learning framework, which leverages limited ST signals to guide multi-scale histological representation learning for accurate and robust spatial gene expression prediction. Extensive evaluations on two public ST datasets and multiple prompt sampling strategies simulating real-world scenarios demonstrate that PH2ST not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, but also shows strong potential for practical applications such as imputing missing spots, ST super-resolution, and local-to-global prediction, highlighting its value for scalable and cost-effective spatial gene expression mapping in biomedical contexts.</p></details> |  |

Traditional solutions typically involve training dedicated models per degradation, resulting in inefficiency and redundancy. More recent approaches either introduce additional modules to learn visual prompts, significantly increasing model size, or incorporate cross-modal transfer from large language models trained on vast datasets, adding complexity to the system architecture. In contrast, our approach, termed AnyIR, takes a unified path that leverages inherent similarity across various degradations to enable both efficient and comprehensive restoration through a joint embedding mechanism, without scaling up the model or relying on large language models.Specifically, we examine the sub-latent space of each input, identifying key components and reweighting them first in a gated manner. To fuse the intrinsic degradation awareness and the contextualized attention, a spatial-frequency parallel fusion strategy is proposed for enhancing spatial-aware local-global interactions and enriching the restoration details from the frequency perspective. Extensive benchmarking in the all-in-one restoration setting confirms AnyIR's SOTA performance, reducing model complexity by around 82\% in parameters and 85\% in FLOPs.

Neural network-based thermal prediction models can perform real-time predictions for many unseen new designs. However, existing CNN-based and GCN-based methods cannot effectively capture the global thermal features, especially for high-frequency components, hindering prediction accuracy enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-spatial dual domain aware prediction network (FSA-Heat) for fast and high-accuracy thermal prediction in 2.5D ICs. It integrates high-to-low frequency and spatial domain encoder (FSTE) module with frequency domain cross-scale interaction module (FCIFormer) to achieve high-to-low frequency and global-to-local thermal dissipation feature extraction. Additionally, a frequency-spatial hybrid loss (FSL) is designed to effectively attenuate high-frequency thermal gradient noise and spatial misalignments. The experimental results show that the performance enhancements offered by our proposed method are substantial, outperforming the newly-proposed 2.5D method, GCN+PNA, by considerable margins (over 99% RMSE reduction, 4.23X inference time speedup). Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrate that FSA-Heat also exhibits robust generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 22nd Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference (DATE '25)</p></details> |

This allows models to develop a comprehensive understanding of the 3D scene, enabling their applicability to a broader range of areas, such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and AR/VR. While large multi-modal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in a wide range of image and video understanding tasks, their capabilities to perform 3D spatial reasoning on diverse natural images are less studied. In this work we present the first comprehensive 3D spatial reasoning benchmark, 3DSRBench, with 2,772 manually annotated visual question-answer pairs across 12 question types. We conduct robust and thorough evaluation of 3D spatial reasoning capabilities by balancing the data distribution and adopting a novel FlipEval strategy. To further study the robustness of 3D spatial reasoning w.r.t. camera 3D viewpoints, our 3DSRBench includes two subsets with 3D spatial reasoning questions on paired images with common and uncommon viewpoints. We benchmark a wide range of open-sourced and proprietary LMMs, uncovering their limitations in various aspects of 3D awareness, such as height, orientation, location, and multi-object reasoning, as well as their degraded performance on images with uncommon camera viewpoints. Our 3DSRBench provide valuable findings and insights about the future development of LMMs with strong 3D reasoning capabilities.

However, they still struggle to properly render the spatial relationships described in text prompts. To address the lack of spatial information in T2I generations, existing methods typically use external network conditioning and predefined layouts, resulting in higher computational costs and reduced flexibility. Our approach builds upon a curated dataset of spatially explicit prompts, meticulously extracted and synthesized from LAION-400M to ensure precise alignment between textual descriptions and spatial layouts. Alongside this dataset, we present ESPLoRA, a flexible fine-tuning framework based on Low-Rank Adaptation, specifically designed to enhance spatial consistency in generative models without increasing generation time or compromising the quality of the outputs. In addition to ESPLoRA, we propose refined evaluation metrics grounded in geometric constraints, capturing 3D spatial relations such as \textit{in front of} or \textit{behind}. These metrics also expose spatial biases in T2I models which, even when not fully mitigated, can be strategically exploited by our TORE algorithm to further improve the spatial consistency of generated images. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art framework, CoMPaSS, by 13.33% on established spatial consistency benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Previous work has established that the VAMP decoder for SS achieves Shannon capacity when the design matrix satisfies a specific spectral criterion and exponential decay power allocation is used. In this work, we propose a spatially coupled VAMP (SC-VAMP) decoder for SS with spatially coupled design matrices. Based on state evolution (SE) analysis, we demonstrate that the SC-VAMP decoder is capacity-achieving when the design matrices satisfy the spectra criterion. Empirically, we show that the SC-VAMP decoder outperforms the VAMP decoder with exponential decay power allocation, achieving a lower section error rate.

Existing benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities. To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning: multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across 5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns observed in real-world image settings.

Our method proposes using HDR Gaussian Splats as light source representation, marking the first time regular images can serve as light sources in a 3D renderer. Our two-stage process first enhances the dynamic range of images plausibly and accurately by leveraging the priors embedded in diffusion models. Next, we employ Gaussian Splats to model 3D lighting, achieving spatially variant lighting. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results on HDR estimations and their applications in illuminating virtual objects and scenes. To facilitate the benchmarking of images as light sources, we introduce a novel dataset of calibrated and unsaturated HDR to evaluate images as light sources. We assess our method using a combination of this novel dataset and an existing dataset from the literature. Project page: https://lvsn.github.io/gaslight/</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient estimation of semiparametric spatial point processes with V-fold random thinning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04359v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a broad class of models called semiparametric spatial point processes where the intensity function contains both a parametric component and a nonparametric component. We propose a novel estimator of the parametric component based on random thinning, a common sampling technique in point processes. The proposed estimator of the parametric component is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal if the nonparametric component can be estimated at the desired rate. We then extend a popular kernel-based estimator in i.i.d. settings and establish convergence rates that will enable inference for the parametric component. Next, we generalize the notion of semiparametric efficiency lower bound in i.i.d. settings to spatial point processes and show that the proposed estimator achieves the efficiency lower bound if the process is Poisson. Computationally, we show how to efficiently evaluate the proposed estimator with existing software for generalized partial linear models in i.i.d. settings by tailoring the sampling weights to replicate the dependence induced by the point process. We conclude with a small simulation study and a re-analysis of the spatial distribution of rainforest trees.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-Shot Shape and Reflectance with Spatial Polarization Multiplexing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13177v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose spatial polarization multiplexing (SPM) for reconstructing object shape and reflectance from a single polarimetric image and demonstrate its application to dynamic surface recovery. Although single-pattern structured light enables single-shot shape reconstruction, the reflectance is challenging to recover due to the lack of angular sampling of incident light and the entanglement of the projected pattern and the surface color texture. We design a spatially multiplexed pattern of polarization that can be robustly and uniquely decoded for shape reconstruction by quantizing the AoLP values. At the same time, our spatial-multiplexing enables single-shot ellipsometry of linear polarization by projecting differently polarized light within a local region, which separates the specular and diffuse reflections for BRDF estimation. We achieve this spatial polarization multiplexing with a constrained de Bruijn sequence. Unlike single-pattern structured light with intensity and color, our polarization pattern is invisible to the naked eye and retains the natural surface appearance which is essential for accurate appearance modeling and also interaction with people. We experimentally validate our method on real data. The results show that our method can recover the shape, the Mueller matrix, and the BRDF from a single-shot polarimetric image. We also demonstrate the application of our method to dynamic surfaces.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating Spatial Frame of Reference Under Ambiguities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17385v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial expressions in situated communication can be ambiguous, as their meanings vary depending on the frames of reference (FoR) adopted by speakers and listeners. While spatial language understanding and reasoning by vision-language models (VLMs) have gained increasing attention, potential ambiguities in these models are still under-explored. To address this issue, we present the COnsistent Multilingual Frame Of Reference Test (COMFORT), an evaluation protocol to systematically assess the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art VLMs using COMFORT. Despite showing some alignment with English conventions in resolving ambiguities, our experiments reveal significant shortcomings of VLMs: notably, the models (1) exhibit poor robustness and consistency, (2) lack the flexibility to accommodate multiple FoRs, and (3) fail to adhere to language-specific or culture-specific conventions in cross-lingual tests, as English tends to dominate other languages. With a growing effort to align vision-language models with human cognitive intuitions, we call for more attention to the ambiguous nature and cross-cultural diversity of spatial reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 (Oral) | Project page: https://spatial-comfort.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Confidence Regions for Excursion Sets with False Discovery Rate Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13124v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying areas where the signal is prominent is an important task in image analysis, with particular applications in brain mapping. In this work, we develop confidence regions for spatial excursion sets above and below a given level. We achieve this by treating the confidence procedure as a testing problem at the given level, allowing control of the False Discovery Rate (FDR). Methods are developed to control the FDR, separately for positive and negative excursions, as well as jointly over both. Furthermore, power is increased by incorporating a two-stage adaptive procedure. Simulation results with various signals show that our confidence regions successfully control the FDR under the nominal level. We showcase our methods with an application to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project illustrating the improvement in statistical power over existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce VistaDPO, a novel framework for Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Direct Preference Optimization. VistaDPO enhances text-video preference alignment across three hierarchical levels: i) Instance Level, aligning overall video content with responses; ii) Temporal Level, aligning video temporal semantics with event descriptions; and iii) Perceptive Level, aligning spatial objects with language tokens. Given the lack of datasets for fine-grained video-language preference alignment, we construct VistaDPO-7k, a dataset of 7.2K QA pairs annotated with chosen and rejected responses, along with spatial-temporal grounding information such as timestamps, keyframes, and bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Video Hallucination, Video QA, and Captioning performance tasks demonstrate that VistaDPO significantly improves the performance of existing LVMs, effectively mitigating video-language misalignment and hallucination.

| **[Benchmarking the Spatial Robustness of DNNs via Natural and Adversarial Localized Corruptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01632v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The robustness of DNNs is a crucial factor in safety-critical applications, particularly in complex and dynamic environments where localized corruptions can arise. While previous studies have evaluated the robustness of semantic segmentation (SS) models under whole-image natural or adversarial corruptions, a comprehensive investigation into the spatial robustness of dense vision models under localized corruptions remained underexplored. This paper fills this gap by introducing specialized metrics for benchmarking the spatial robustness of segmentation models, alongside with an evaluation framework to assess the impact of localized corruptions. Furthermore, we uncover the inherent complexity of characterizing worst-case robustness using a single localized adversarial perturbation. To address this, we propose region-aware multi-attack adversarial analysis, a method that enables a deeper understanding of model robustness against adversarial perturbations applied to specific regions. The proposed metrics and analysis were exploited to evaluate 14 segmentation models in driving scenarios, uncovering key insights into the effects of localized corruption in both natural and adversarial forms. The results reveal that models respond to these two types of threats differently; for instance, transformer-based segmentation models demonstrate notable robustness to localized natural corruptions but are highly vulnerable to adversarial ones and vice-versa for CNN-based models. Consequently, we also address the challenge of balancing robustness to both natural and adversarial localized corruptions by means of ensemble models, thereby achieving a broader threat coverage and improved reliability for dense vision tasks.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Spatial Functional Deep Neural Network Model: A New Prediction Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12750v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of spatially dependent functional data is critical for various engineering and scientific applications. In this study, a spatial functional deep neural network model was developed with a novel non-linear modeling framework that seamlessly integrates spatial dependencies and functional predictors using deep learning techniques. The proposed model extends classical scalar-on-function regression by incorporating a spatial autoregressive component while leveraging functional deep neural networks to capture complex non-linear relationships. To ensure a robust estimation, the methodology employs an adaptive estimation approach, where the spatial dependence parameter was first inferred via maximum likelihood estimation, followed by non-linear functional regression using deep learning. The effectiveness of the proposed model was evaluated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations and an application to Brazilian COVID-19 data, where the goal was to predict the average daily number of deaths. Comparative analysis with maximum likelihood-based spatial functional linear regression and functional deep neural network models demonstrates that the proposed algorithm significantly improves predictive performance. The results for the Brazilian COVID-19 data showed that while all models achieved similar mean squared error values over the training modeling phase, the proposed model achieved the lowest mean squared prediction error in the testing phase, indicating superior generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals and significant inter-subject variability cause substantial challenges for developing robust cross-subject classification models. This paper introduces a novel Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Attention Fusion (SSTAF) Transformer specifically designed for upper-limb motor imagery classification. Our architecture consists of a spectral transformer and a spatial transformer, followed by a transformer block and a classifier network. Each module is integrated with attention mechanisms that dynamically attend to the most discriminative patterns across multiple domains, such as spectral frequencies, spatial electrode locations, and temporal dynamics. The short-time Fourier transform is incorporated to extract features in the time-frequency domain to make it easier for the model to obtain a better feature distinction. We evaluated our SSTAF Transformer model on two publicly available datasets, the EEGMMIDB dataset, and BCI Competition IV-2a. SSTAF Transformer achieves an accuracy of 76.83% and 68.30% in the data sets, respectively, outperforms traditional CNN-based architectures and a few existing transformer-based approaches.</p></details> | 11 pages |

This paper introduces a mapping representation that accurately captures scene geometry for sonification, turning physical spaces into auditory experiences. Using depth sensors, we encode an incrementally built 3D scene into a compact 360-degree representation with angular and distance information, aligning this way with human auditory spatial perception. The proposed framework performs localisation and mapping via VDB-Gaussian Process Distance Fields for efficient online scene reconstruction. The key aspect is a sensor-centric structure that maintains either a 2D-circular or 3D-cylindrical raster-based projection. This spatial representation is then converted into binaural auditory signals using simple pre-recorded responses from a representative room. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show improvements in accuracy, coverage, timing and suitability for sonification compared to other approaches, with effective handling of dynamic objects as well. An accompanying video demonstrates spatial sonification in room-like environments. https://tinyurl.com/ListenToYourMap</p></details> |  |

However, conventional methods still face significant challenges, particularly in spatial reasoning, precise region segmentation, and maintaining semantic consistency, especially in complex scenes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SmartFreeEdit, a novel end-to-end framework that integrates a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a hypergraph-enhanced inpainting architecture, enabling precise, mask-free image editing guided exclusively by natural language instructions. The key innovations of SmartFreeEdit include:(1)the introduction of region aware tokens and a mask embedding paradigm that enhance the spatial understanding of complex scenes;(2) a reasoning segmentation pipeline designed to optimize the generation of editing masks based on natural language instructions;and (3) a hypergraph-augmented inpainting module that ensures the preservation of both structural integrity and semantic coherence during complex edits, overcoming the limitations of local-based image generation. Extensive experiments on the Reason-Edit benchmark demonstrate that SmartFreeEdit surpasses current state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including segmentation accuracy, instruction adherence, and visual quality preservation, while addressing the issue of local information focus and improving global consistency in the edited image. Our project will be available at https://github.com/smileformylove/SmartFreeEdit.</p></details> |  |

However, how pretrained models acquire such abilities, especially high-level reasoning, remains unclear. This paper introduces Embodied-R, a collaborative framework combining large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for perception and small-scale Language Models (LMs) for reasoning. Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel reward system considering think-answer logical consistency, the model achieves slow-thinking capabilities with limited computational resources. After training on only 5k embodied video samples, Embodied-R with a 3B LM matches state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning models (OpenAI-o1, Gemini-2.5-pro) on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution embodied spatial reasoning tasks. Embodied-R also exhibits emergent thinking patterns such as systematic analysis and contextual integration. We further explore research questions including response length, training on VLM, strategies for reward design, and differences in model generalization after SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and RL training.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Learning spatial hearing via innate mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10605v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The acoustic cues used by humans and other animals to localise sounds are subtle, and change during and after development. This means that we need to constantly relearn or recalibrate the auditory spatial map throughout our lifetimes. This is often thought of as a "supervised" learning process where a "teacher" (for example, a parent, or your visual system) tells you whether or not you guessed the location correctly, and you use this information to update your map. However, there is not always an obvious teacher (for example in babies or blind people). Using computational models, we showed that approximate feedback from a simple innate circuit, such as that can distinguish left from right (e.g. the auditory orienting response), is sufficient to learn an accurate full-range spatial auditory map. Moreover, using this mechanism in addition to supervised learning can more robustly maintain the adaptive neural representation. We find several possible neural mechanisms that could underlie this type of learning, and hypothesise that multiple mechanisms may be present and interact with each other. We conclude that when studying spatial hearing, we should not assume that the only source of learning is from the visual system or other supervisory signal. Further study of the proposed mechanisms could allow us to design better rehabilitation programmes to accelerate relearning/recalibration of spatial maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Moran Eigenvectors Improve Machine Learning of Spatial Data? Insights from Synthetic Data Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12450v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moran Eigenvector Spatial Filtering (ESF) approaches have shown promise in accounting for spatial effects in statistical models. Can this extend to machine learning? This paper examines the effectiveness of using Moran Eigenvectors as additional spatial features in machine learning models. We generate synthetic datasets with known processes involving spatially varying and nonlinear effects across two different geometries. Moran Eigenvectors calculated from different spatial weights matrices, with and without a priori eigenvector selection, are tested. We assess the performance of popular machine learning models, including Random Forests, LightGBM, XGBoost, and TabNet, and benchmark their accuracies in terms of cross-validated R2 values against models that use only coordinates as features. We also extract coefficients and functions from the models using GeoShapley and compare them with the true processes. Results show that machine learning models using only location coordinates achieve better accuracies than eigenvector-based approaches across various experiments and datasets. Furthermore, we discuss that while these findings are relevant for spatial processes that exhibit positive spatial autocorrelation, they do not necessarily apply when modeling network autocorrelation and cases with negative spatial autocorrelation, where Moran Eigenvectors would still be useful.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geographical Context Matters: Bridging Fine and Coarse Spatial Information to Enhance Continental Land Cover Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12368v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Land use and land cover mapping from Earth Observation (EO) data is a critical tool for sustainable land and resource management. While advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms excel at analyzing EO imagery data, they often overlook crucial geospatial metadata information that could enhance scalability and accuracy across regional, continental, and global scales. To address this limitation, we propose BRIDGE-LC (Bi-level Representation Integration for Disentangled GEospatial Land Cover), a novel deep learning framework that integrates multi-scale geospatial information into the land cover classification process. By simultaneously leveraging fine-grained (latitude/longitude) and coarse-grained (biogeographical region) spatial information, our lightweight multi-layer perceptron architecture learns from both during training but only requires fine-grained information for inference, allowing it to disentangle region-specific from region-agnostic land cover features while maintaining computational efficiency. To assess the quality of our framework, we use an open-access in-situ dataset and adopt several competing classification approaches commonly considered for large-scale land cover mapping. We evaluated all approaches through two scenarios: an extrapolation scenario in which training data encompasses samples from all biogeographical regions, and a leave-one-region-out scenario where one region is excluded from training. We also explore the spatial representation learned by our model, highlighting a connection between its internal manifold and the geographical information used during training. Our results demonstrate that integrating geospatial information improves land cover mapping performance, with the most substantial gains achieved by jointly leveraging both fine- and coarse-grained spatial information.</p></details> |  |
| **[GripMap: An Efficient, Spatially Resolved Constraint Framework for Offline and Online Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Racing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12115v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional trajectory planning approaches for autonomous vehicles often assume a fixed vehicle model that remains constant regardless of the vehicle's location. This overlooks the critical fact that the tires and the surface are the two force-transmitting partners in vehicle dynamics; while the tires stay with the vehicle, surface conditions vary with location. Recognizing these challenges, this paper presents a novel framework for spatially resolving dynamic constraints in both offline and online planning algorithms applied to autonomous racing. We introduce the GripMap concept, which provides a spatial resolution of vehicle dynamic constraints in the Frenet frame, allowing adaptation to locally varying grip conditions. This enables compensation for location-specific effects, more efficient vehicle behavior, and increased safety, unattainable with spatially invariant vehicle models. The focus is on low storage demand and quick access through perfect hashing. This framework proved advantageous in real-world applications in the presented form. Experiments inspired by autonomous racing demonstrate its effectiveness. In future work, this framework can serve as a foundational layer for developing future interpretable learning algorithms that adjust to varying grip conditions in real-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-shot Star-convex Polygon-based Instance Segmentation for Spatially-correlated Biomedical Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12078v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical images often contain objects known to be spatially correlated or nested due to their inherent properties, leading to semantic relations. Examples include cell nuclei being nested within eukaryotic cells and colonies growing exclusively within their culture dishes. While these semantic relations bear key importance, detection tasks are often formulated independently, requiring multi-shot analysis pipelines. Importantly, spatial correlation could constitute a fundamental prior facilitating learning of more meaningful representations for tasks like instance segmentation. This knowledge has, thus far, not been utilised by the biomedical computer vision community. We argue that the instance segmentation of two or more categories of objects can be achieved in parallel. We achieve this via two architectures HydraStarDist (HSD) and the novel (HSD-WBR) based on the widely-used StarDist (SD), to take advantage of the star-convexity of our target objects. HSD and HSD-WBR are constructed to be capable of incorporating their interactions as constraints into account. HSD implicitly incorporates spatial correlation priors based on object interaction through a joint encoder. HSD-WBR further enforces the prior in a regularisation layer with the penalty we proposed named Within Boundary Regularisation Penalty (WBR). Both architectures achieve nested instance segmentation in a single shot. We demonstrate their competitiveness based on $IoU_R$ and AP and superiority in a new, task-relevant criteria, Joint TP rate (JTPR) compared to their baseline SD and Cellpose. Our approach can be further modified to capture partial-inclusion/-exclusion in multi-object interactions in fluorescent or brightfield microscopy or digital imaging. Finally, our strategy suggests gains by making this learning single-shot and computationally efficient.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Here, we investigate the optimal placement of such receptors through a theoretical model that minimizes uncertainty in gradient estimation. Without requiring a priori knowledge of the physical limits of sensing or biochemical processes, we reproduce the emergence of clusters that closely resemble those observed in real cells. On perfect spherical surfaces, optimally placed receptors spread uniformly. When perturbations break their symmetry, receptors cluster in regions of high curvature, massively reducing estimation uncertainty. This agrees with mechanistic models that minimize elastic preference discrepancies between receptors and cell membranes. We further extend our model to motile receptors responding to cell-shape changes and external fluid flow, demonstrating the relevance of our model in realistic scenarios. Our findings provide a simple and utilitarian explanation for receptor clustering at high-curvature regions when high sensing accuracy is paramount.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version has been accepted for publication in Physical Review Letters.

Current smart home systems largely rely on device-specific identifiers, limiting user interaction to explicit naming conventions rather than natural spatial references. INOT addresses this limitation through a modular architecture that integrates Vision Language Models with IoT control systems to enable natural language commands with spatial context (e.g., "turn on the light near the window"). The system comprises key components including an Onboarding Inference Engine, Zero-Shot Device Detection, Spatial Topology Inference, and Intent-Based Command Synthesis. A comprehensive user study with 15 participants demonstrated INOT's significant advantages over conventional systems like Google Home Assistant, with users reporting reduced cognitive workload (NASA-TLX scores decreased by an average of 13.17 points), higher ease-of-use ratings, and stronger preference (14 out of 15 participants). By eliminating the need to memorize device identifiers and enabling context-aware spatial commands, INOT represents a significant advancement in creating more intuitive and accessible smart home control systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 Figures |

However, limitations of the technology such as the relatively low resolution and comparatively insufficient sequencing depth make it difficult to reliably extract real biological signals from these data. To alleviate this challenge, we propose a novel transfer learning framework, referred to as TransST, to adaptively leverage the cell-labeled information from external sources in inferring cell-level heterogeneity of a target spatial transcriptomics data. Results: Applications in several real studies as well as a number of simulation settings show that our approach significantly improves existing techniques. For example, in the breast cancer study, TransST successfully identifies five biologically meaningful cell clusters, including the two subgroups of cancer in situ and invasive cancer; in addition, only TransST is able to separate the adipose tissues from the connective issues among all the studied methods. Conclusions: In summary, the proposed method TransST is both effective and robust in identifying cell subclusters and detecting corresponding driving biomarkers in spatial transcriptomics data.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel classification method, termed SSQDA, which is constructed via constrained convex optimization based on the sample spatial median and spatial sign covariance matrix under the assumption of an elliptically symmetric distribution. The proposed classifier is shown to achieve the optimal convergence rate over a broad class of parameter spaces, up to a logarithmic factor. Extensive simulation studies and real data applications demonstrate that SSQDA is both robust and efficient, particularly in the presence of heavy-tailed distributions, highlighting its practical advantages in high-dimensional classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

Users frequently require aggregated statistical information derived from historical sensory data within specific spatial and temporal boundaries. To address this, users submit aggregation query requests with spatial-temporal constraints to target UAVs that store the relevant data. These UAVs process and return the query results, which can be aggregated within the network during transmission to conserve energy and bandwidth-resources that are inherently limited in UAV networks. However,the dynamic topology caused by UAV mobility, coupled with these resource constraints, makes efficient in-network aggregation challenging without compromising user query delay. To the best of our knowledge, existing research has yet to adequately explore spatial-temporal range aggregation queries in the context of UAV networks. In this paper, we propose ESTA, an Efficient Spatial-Temporal range Aggregation query processing algorithm tailored for UAV networks. ESTA leverages pre-planned UAV trajectories to construct a topology change graph that models the network's evolving connectivity. It then employs an efficient shortest path algorithm to determine the minimum query response delay. Subsequently, while adhering to user-specified delay constraints, ESTA transforms the in-network aggregation process into a series of set cover problems, which are solved recursively to build a Spatial-Temporal Aggregation Tree (STAT). This tree enables the identification of an energy-efficient routing path for aggregating and delivering query results. Extensive simulations demonstrate that ESTA reduces energy consumption by more than 50% compared to a baseline algorithm, all while satisfying the required query delay.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

BrickSmart, a pioneering system, addresses this gap by providing spatial language guidance through a structured three-step process: Discovery & Design, Build & Learn, and Explore & Expand. This system uniquely supports parents in 1) generating personalized block-building instructions, 2) guiding parents to teach spatial language during building and interactive play, and 3) tracking children's learning progress, altogether enhancing children's engagement and cognitive development. In a comparative study involving 12 parent-child pairs children aged 6-8 years) for both experimental and control groups, BrickSmart demonstrated improvements in supportiveness, efficiency, and innovation, with a significant increase in children's use of spatial vocabularies during block play, thereby offering an effective framework for fostering spatial language skills in children.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |

This kernel scheme reduces the number of parameters with respect to a fully connected neural network (NN). While CNN has proven to be an effective model in recognition of handwritten characters and traffic signal sign boards, etc. recently, its deep variants have proven to be effective in similar as well as more challenging applications like object, scene and action recognition. Deep CNN add more layers and kernels to the classical CNN, increasing the number of parameters, and partly reducing the main advantage of CNN which is less parameters. In this paper, a 3D pyramidal neural network called 3DPyraNet and a discriminative approach for spatio-temporal feature learning based on it, called 3DPyraNet-F, are proposed. 3DPyraNet introduces a new weighting scheme which learns features from both spatial and temporal dimensions analyzing multiple adjacent frames and keeping a biological plausible structure. It keeps the spatial topology of the input image and presents fewer parameters and lower computational and memory costs compared to both fully connected NNs and recent deep CNNs. 3DPyraNet-F extract the features maps of the highest layer of the learned network, fuse them in a single vector, and provide it as input in such a way to a linear-SVM classifier that enhances the recognition of human actions and dynamic scenes from the videos. Encouraging results are reported with 3DPyraNet in real-world environments, especially in the presence of camera induced motion. Further, 3DPyraNet-F clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art on three benchmark datasets and shows comparable result for the fourth.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often fail to incorporate adequate spatio-temporal modeling and prompt alignment within a unified framework, resulting in temporal inconsistencies, geometric distortions, or low-quality 4D content that deviates from the provided texts. Therefore, we propose STP4D, a novel approach that aims to integrate comprehensive spatio-temporal-prompt consistency modeling for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Specifically, STP4D employs three carefully designed modules: Time-varying Prompt Embedding, Geometric Information Enhancement, and Temporal Extension Deformation, which collaborate to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, STP4D is among the first methods to exploit the Diffusion model to generate 4D Gaussians, combining the fine-grained modeling capabilities and the real-time rendering process of 4DGS with the rapid inference speed of the Diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STP4D excels in generating high-fidelity 4D content with exceptional efficiency (approximately 4.6s per asset), surpassing existing methods in both quality and speed.</p></details> |  |

Multi-sensor synchronous measurement has proven to be more effective for WHAR than using a single sensor. However, existing WHAR methods use shared convolutional kernels for indiscriminate temporal feature extraction across each sensor variable, which fails to effectively capture spatio-temporal relationships of intra-sensor and inter-sensor variables. We propose the DecomposeWHAR model consisting of a decomposition phase and a fusion phase to better model the relationships between modality variables. The decomposition creates high-dimensional representations of each intra-sensor variable through the improved Depth Separable Convolution to capture local temporal features while preserving their unique characteristics. The fusion phase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and fusing their features at both the channel and variable levels. Long-range temporal dependencies are modeled using the State Space Model (SSM), and later cross-sensor interactions are dynamically captured through a self-attention mechanism, highlighting inter-sensor spatial correlations. Our model demonstrates superior performance on three widely used WHAR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 3D segmentation models solely focus on spatial information. To address this gap, we propose OmniMamba4D, a novel segmentation model designed for 4D medical images (3D images over time). OmniMamba4D utilizes a spatio-temporal tetra-orientated Mamba block to effectively capture both spatial and temporal features. Unlike traditional 3D models, which analyze single-time points, OmniMamba4D processes 4D CT data, providing comprehensive spatio-temporal information on lesion progression. Evaluated on an internal dataset comprising of 3,252 CT scans, OmniMamba4D achieves a competitive Dice score of 0.682, comparable to state-of-the-arts (SOTA) models, while maintaining computational efficiency and better detecting disappeared lesions. This work demonstrates a new framework to leverage spatio-temporal information for longitudinal CT lesion segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2025</p></details> |

However, the inherent nonlinearity of the marine dynamic system presents significant challenges. Current forecasting methods mainly include physics-based numerical simulations and data-driven machine learning approaches. The former, while describing SST evolution through differential equations, suffers from high computational complexity and limited applicability, whereas the latter, despite its computational benefits, requires large datasets and faces interpretability challenges. This study presents a prediction framework based solely on data-driven techniques. Using phase space reconstruction, we construct initial-delay attractor pairs with a mathematical homeomorphism and design a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Mapping (STFM) to uncover their intrinsic connections. Unlike conventional models, our method captures SST dynamics efficiently through phase space reconstruction and achieves high prediction accuracy with minimal training data in comparative tests</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures |

However, the low resolution of TIR images, along with tracking interference, significantly limits the perfor-mance of TIR trackers. To address these challenges, we introduce STARS, a novel sparse learning-based CF tracker that incorporates spatio-temporal regulari-zation and super-resolution reconstruction. First, we apply adaptive sparse filter-ing and temporal domain filtering to extract key features of the target while reduc-ing interference from background clutter and noise. Next, we introduce an edge-preserving sparse regularization method to stabilize target features and prevent excessive blurring. This regularization integrates multiple terms and employs the alternating direction method of multipliers to optimize the solution. Finally, we propose a gradient-enhanced super-resolution method to extract fine-grained TIR target features and improve the resolution of TIR images, addressing performance degradation in tracking caused by low-resolution sequences. To the best of our knowledge, STARS is the first to integrate super-resolution methods within a sparse learning-based CF framework. Extensive experiments on the LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR2017 benchmarks demonstrate that STARS outperforms state-of-the-art trackers in terms of robustness.</p></details> |  |

Among EEG techniques, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is favored due to its robust signal-to-noise ratio, minimal training demands, and elevated information transmission rate. Frequency detection in SSVEP-based brain-computer interfaces commonly employs canonical correlation analysis (CCA). SSCCA (spatio-spectral canonical correlation analysis) augments CCA by refining spatial filtering. This paper presents a multistage feature fusion methodology for short-duration SSVEP frequency identification, employing SSCCA with template signals derived via leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). A filterbank generates bandpass filters for stimulus frequencies and their harmonics, whereas SSCCA calculates correlation coefficients between subbands and templates. Two phases of non-linear weighting amalgamate these coefficients to discern the target stimulus. This multistage methodology surpasses traditional techniques, attaining a accuracy of 94.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is presented in the Undergraduate Conference on Intelligent Computing and Systems (UCICS 2025) organised by Varendra University, Rajshahi, Bangladesh, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541v3)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, similar to most RGBT fusion tasks, it still mainly relies on manually aligned multimodal image pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Multimodal Spatio-temporal Graph learning Network (MSGNet) for alignment-free RGBT VOD problem by leveraging the robust graph representation learning model. Specifically, we first design an Adaptive Partitioning Layer (APL) to estimate the corresponding regions of the Thermal image within the RGB image (high-resolution), achieving a preliminary inexact alignment. Then, we introduce the Spatial Sparse Graph Learning Module (S-SGLM) which employs a sparse information passing mechanism on the estimated inexact alignment to achieve reliable information interaction between different modalities. Moreover, to fully exploit the temporal cues for RGBT VOD problem, we introduce Hybrid Structured Temporal Modeling (HSTM), which involves a Temporal Sparse Graph Learning Module (T-SGLM) and Temporal Star Block (TSB). T-SGLM aims to filter out some redundant information between adjacent frames by employing the sparse aggregation mechanism on the temporal graph. Meanwhile, TSB is dedicated to achieving the complementary learning of local spatial relationships. Extensive comparative experiments conducted on both the aligned dataset VT-VOD50 and the unaligned dataset UVT-VOD2024 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. Our project will be made available on our website for free public access.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPOT: Spatio-Temporal Pattern Mining and Optimization for Load Consolidation in Freight Transportation Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09680v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Freight consolidation has significant potential to reduce transportation costs and mitigate congestion and pollution. An effective load consolidation plan relies on carefully chosen consolidation points to ensure alignment with existing transportation management processes, such as driver scheduling, personnel planning, and terminal operations. This complexity represents a significant challenge when searching for optimal consolidation strategies. Traditional optimization-based methods provide exact solutions, but their computational complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances and they fail to leverage historical data. Machine learning-based approaches address these issues but often ignore operational constraints, leading to infeasible consolidation plans. This work proposes SPOT, an end-to-end approach that integrates the benefits of machine learning (ML) and optimization for load consolidation. The ML component plays a key role in the planning phase by identifying the consolidation points through spatio-temporal clustering and constrained frequent itemset mining, while the optimization selects the most cost-effective feasible consolidation routes for a given operational day. Extensive experiments conducted on industrial load data demonstrate that SPOT significantly reduces travel distance and transportation costs (by about 50% on large terminals) compared to the existing industry-standard load planning strategy and a neighborhood-based heuristic. Moreover, the ML component provides valuable tactical-level insights by identifying frequently recurring consolidation opportunities that guide proactive planning. In addition, SPOT is computationally efficient and can be easily scaled to accommodate large transportation networks.</p></details> |  |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Joint Conference on Neural Networks(IJCNN), 2015</p></details> |

The key challenge of accurate prediction is how to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and adapt to the inherent dynamics in data. Traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) often struggle with static adjacency matrices that introduce domain bias or learnable matrices that may be overfitting to specific patterns. This challenge becomes more complex when considering Multi-Task Learning (MTL). While MTL has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy through task synergies, it can also face significant hurdles due to task interference. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a novel MTL framework, Dynamic Group-wise Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task Learning (DG-STMTL). DG-STMTL proposes a hybrid adjacency matrix generation module that combines static matrices with dynamic ones through a task-specific gating mechanism. We also introduce a group-wise GCN module to enhance the modelling capability of spatio-temporal dependencies. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate our method. Results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-arts, indicating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[SpaceVLLM: Endowing Multimodal Large Language Model with Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13983v3)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in either temporal or spatial localization. However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and model will be released at https://github.com/Jayce1kk/SpaceVLLM.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[STNAGNN: Data-driven Spatio-temporal Brain Connectivity beyond FC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12065v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in the analysis of brain fMRI, yet defining the connectivity between ROIs remains a challenge in noisy fMRI data. Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |

Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.</p></details> | 6 pages |

We would like to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. Thus, we propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address these challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance (in terms of an f-divergence) between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.09482</p></details> |

Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatio-temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent urban traffic management solutions.

Decoding covert speech from electroencephalogram (EEG) is challenging due to a limited understanding of neural pronunciation mapping and the low signal-to-noise ratio of the signal. In this study, we developed a large-scale multi-utterance speech EEG dataset from 57 right-handed native English-speaking subjects, each performing covert and overt speech tasks by repeating the same word in five utterances within a ten-second duration. Given the spatio-temporal nature of the neural activation process during speech pronunciation, we developed a Functional Areas Spatio-temporal Transformer (FAST), an effective framework for converting EEG signals into tokens and utilizing transformer architecture for sequence encoding. Our results reveal distinct and interpretable speech neural features by the visualization of FAST-generated activation maps across frontal and temporal brain regions with each word being covertly spoken, providing new insights into the discriminative features of the neural representation of covert speech. This is the first report of such a study, which provides interpretable evidence for speech decoding from EEG.

| **[DRAN: A Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network for Spatio-temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01531v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems' states are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. To address non-stationarity frameworks, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, we develop a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module that enables the normalization and de-normalization process in spatio-temporal systems. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state of the art methods in weather prediction and traffic flows forecasting tasks. Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes. Moreover, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of ``data-governance-analytics-decision.'' We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on the ``AGREE'' principles: Automation, Generalization, Robustness, Explainability, and Efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions.

However, the inherently sparse and non-deterministic nature of radar data limits the effectiveness of traditional single-frame BEV paradigms. In this paper, we addresses this limitation by introducing AttentiveGRU, a novel attention-based recurrent approach tailored for radar constraints, which extracts individualized spatio-temporal context for objects by dynamically identifying and fusing temporally correlated structures across present and memory states. By leveraging the consistency of object's latent representation over time, our approach exploits temporal relations to enrich feature representations for both stationary and moving objects, thereby enhancing detection performance and eliminating the need for externally providing or estimating any information about ego vehicle motion. Our experimental results on the public nuScenes dataset show a significant increase in mAP for the car category by 21% over the best radar-only submission. Further evaluations on an additional dataset demonstrate notable improvements in object detection capabilities, underscoring the applicability and effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, SNN possess a crucial characteristic, namely the ability to process spatio-temporal information. However, this ability is constrained by both internal and external factors in practical applications, thereby affecting the performance of SNN. Firstly, the internal issue of SNN lies in the inherent limitations of their network structure and neuronal model, which result in the network adopting a unified processing approach for information of different temporal dimensions when processing input data containing complex temporal information. Secondly, the external issue of SNN stems from the direct encoding method commonly adopted by directly trained SNN, which uses the same feature map for input at each time step, failing to fully exploit the spatio-temporal characteristics of SNN. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Unconstrained Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ULIF) neuronal model that allows for learning different membrane potential parameters at different time steps, thereby enhancing SNN' ability to process information of different temporal dimensions. Additionally, this paper presents a hybrid encoding scheme aimed at solving the problem of direct encoding lacking temporal dimension information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively improve the overall performance of SNN in object detection and object recognition tasks. related code is available at https://github.com/hhx0320/ASNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[EventMamba: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Locality with State Space Models for Event-Based Video Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19721v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging its robust linear global modeling capability, Mamba has notably excelled in computer vision. Despite its success, existing Mamba-based vision models have overlooked the nuances of event-driven tasks, especially in video reconstruction. Event-based video reconstruction (EBVR) demands spatial translation invariance and close attention to local event relationships in the spatio-temporal domain. Unfortunately, conventional Mamba algorithms apply static window partitions and standard reshape scanning methods, leading to significant losses in local connectivity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EventMamba--a specialized model designed for EBVR tasks. EventMamba innovates by incorporating random window offset (RWO) in the spatial domain, moving away from the restrictive fixed partitioning. Additionally, it features a new consistent traversal serialization approach in the spatio-temporal domain, which maintains the proximity of adjacent events both spatially and temporally. These enhancements enable EventMamba to retain Mamba's robust modeling capabilities while significantly preserving the spatio-temporal locality of event data. Comprehensive testing on multiple datasets shows that EventMamba markedly enhances video reconstruction, drastically improving computation speed while delivering superior visual quality compared to Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniFlow: A Foundation Model for Unified Urban Spatio-Temporal Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12972v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal flow prediction, encompassing traffic flows and crowd flows, is crucial for optimizing city infrastructure and managing traffic and emergency responses. Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability.

The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.</p></details> |  |

Built upon the powerful Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, JavisDiT is able to generate high-quality audio and video content simultaneously from open-ended user prompts. To ensure optimal synchronization, we introduce a fine-grained spatio-temporal alignment mechanism through a Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Synchronized Prior (HiST-Sypo) Estimator. This module extracts both global and fine-grained spatio-temporal priors, guiding the synchronization between the visual and auditory components. Furthermore, we propose a new benchmark, JavisBench, consisting of 10,140 high-quality text-captioned sounding videos spanning diverse scenes and complex real-world scenarios. Further, we specifically devise a robust metric for evaluating the synchronization between generated audio-video pairs in real-world complex content. Experimental results demonstrate that JavisDiT significantly outperforms existing methods by ensuring both high-quality generation and precise synchronization, setting a new standard for JAVG tasks.

However, existing multi-sensor fusion research predominantly integrates complementary context from multiple images rather than videos. This primarily stems from two factors: 1) the scarcity of large-scale multi-sensor video datasets, limiting research in video fusion, and 2) the inherent difficulty of jointly modeling spatial and temporal dependencies in a unified framework. This paper proactively compensates for the dilemmas. First, we construct M3SVD, a benchmark dataset with $220$ temporally synchronized and spatially registered infrared-visible video pairs comprising 153,797 frames, filling the data gap for the video fusion community. Secondly, we propose VideoFusion, a multi-modal video fusion model that fully exploits cross-modal complementarity and temporal dynamics to generate spatio-temporally coherent videos from (potentially degraded) multi-modal inputs. Specifically, 1) a differential reinforcement module is developed for cross-modal information interaction and enhancement, 2) a complete modality-guided fusion strategy is employed to adaptively integrate multi-modal features, and 3) a bi-temporal co-attention mechanism is devised to dynamically aggregate forward-backward temporal contexts to reinforce cross-frame feature representations. Extensive experiments reveal that VideoFusion outperforms existing image-oriented fusion paradigms in sequential scenarios, effectively mitigating temporal inconsistency and interference.</p></details> |  |

VT migration is an effective way that migrates the VT when the locations of physical entities keep changing to maintain seamless immersive VT services. However, an efficient VT migration is challenging due to the rapid movement of vehicles, dynamic workloads of Roadside Units (RSUs), and heterogeneous resources of the RSUs. To achieve efficient migration decisions and a minimum latency for the VT migration, we propose a multi-agent split Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework combined with spatio-temporal trajectory generation. In this framework, multiple split DRL agents utilize split architecture to efficiently determine VT migration decisions. Furthermore, we propose a spatio-temporal trajectory generation algorithm based on trajectory datasets and road network data to simulate vehicle trajectories, enhancing the generalization of the proposed scheme for managing VT migration in dynamic network environments. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only enhances the Quality of Experience (QoE) by 29% but also reduces the computational parameter count by approximately 25% while maintaining similar performances, enhancing users' immersive experiences in vehicular metaverses.</p></details> |  |

Our approach combines Bayesian Structural Time Series for modeling marginal crop yields, ensuring a more robust quantification of uncertainty given the typically short historical records. To capture dynamic dependencies between regions, we develop a time-varying conditional copula model, where the copula parameter evolves over time as a function of its previous lag and extreme weather covariates. Unlike traditional approaches that treat climatic factors as fixed inputs, we incorporate dynamic Generalized Extreme Value models to characterize extreme weather events, enabling a more accurate reflection of their impact on crop yields. Furthermore, to ensure scalability for large-scale applications, we build on the existing Partitioning Around Medoids clustering algorithm and introduce a novel dissimilarity measure that integrates both spatial and copula-based dependence, enabling an effective reduction of the dimensionality in the dependence structure.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches face a trilemma: diffusion-based methods achieve high visual fidelity but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while GAN-based solutions sacrifice lip-sync accuracy or dental details for real-time performance. We present MuseTalk, a novel two-stage training framework that resolves this trade-off through latent space optimization and spatio-temporal data sampling strategy. Our key innovations include: (1) During the Facial Abstract Pretraining stage, we propose Informative Frame Sampling to temporally align reference-source pose pairs, eliminating redundant feature interference while preserving identity cues. (2) In the Lip-Sync Adversarial Finetuning stage, we employ Dynamic Margin Sampling to spatially select the most suitable lip-movement-promoting regions, balancing audio-visual synchronization and dental clarity. (3) MuseTalk establishes an effective audio-visual feature fusion framework in the latent space, delivering 30 FPS output at 256*256 resolution on an NVIDIA V100 GPU. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MuseTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity while achieving comparable lip-sync accuracy. %The codes and models will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Recent advances have improved the spatial reasoning ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing large-scale data, but these models still struggle to analyze kinematic elements like traveled distance and speed of moving objects. To bridge this gap, we construct a spatio-temporal reasoning dataset and benchmark involving kinematic instruction tuning, referred to as STKit and STKit-Bench. They consist of real-world videos with 3D annotations, detailing object motion dynamics: traveled distance, speed, movement direction, inter-object distance comparisons, and relative movement direction. To further scale such data construction to videos without 3D labels, we propose an automatic pipeline to generate pseudo-labels using 4D reconstruction in real-world scale. With our kinematic instruction tuning data for spatio-temporal reasoning, we present ST-VLM, a VLM enhanced for spatio-temporal reasoning, which exhibits outstanding performance on STKit-Bench. Furthermore, we show that ST-VLM generalizes robustly across diverse domains and tasks, outperforming baselines on other spatio-temporal benchmarks (eg, ActivityNet, TVQA+). Finally, by integrating learned spatio-temporal reasoning with existing abilities, ST-VLM enables complex multi-step reasoning. Project page: https://ikodoh.github.io/ST-VLM.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world visual relationships often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, causing existing methods for tasks like Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) and Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) to produce biased scene graphs. To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages loss masking and curriculum learning to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Unlike prior methods that add extra architectural components to learn unbiased estimators, we propose an impartial training objective that reduces the dominance of head classes during learning and focuses on underrepresented tail relationships. Our curriculum-driven mask generation strategy further empowers the model to adaptively adjust its bias mitigation strategy over time, enabling more balanced and robust estimations. To thoroughly assess performance under various distribution shifts, we also introduce two new tasks Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation offering a challenging benchmark for evaluating the resilience of STSG models. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate the superior unbiased performance and robustness of our method compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Compared to its predecessor SV4D, SV4D 2.0 is more robust to occlusions and large motion, generalizes better to real-world videos, and produces higher-quality outputs in terms of detail sharpness and spatio-temporal consistency. We achieve this by introducing key improvements in multiple aspects: 1) network architecture: eliminating the dependency of reference multi-views and designing blending mechanism for 3D and frame attention, 2) data: enhancing quality and quantity of training data, 3) training strategy: adopting progressive 3D-4D training for better generalization, and 4) 4D optimization: handling 3D inconsistency and large motion via 2-stage refinement and progressive frame sampling.

However, relation modeling between different image patches exhibits significant variations. For instance, background regions dominated by target-irrelevant information require reduced attention allocation, while foreground, particularly boundary areas, need to be be emphasized. A single model may not effectively handle all kinds of relation modeling simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel tracker called SPMTrack based on mixture-of-experts tailored for visual tracking task (TMoE), combining the capability of multiple experts to handle diverse relation modeling more flexibly. Benefiting from TMoE, we extend relation modeling from image pairs to spatio-temporal context, further improving tracking accuracy with minimal increase in model parameters. Moreover, we employ TMoE as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, substantially reducing trainable parameters, which enables us to train SPMTrack of varying scales efficiently and preserve the generalization ability of pretrained models to achieve superior performance. We conduct experiments on seven datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers.

Despite its importance, conventional LVEF estimation remains time-consuming and operator-dependent. Recent deep learning advancements have enhanced automation, yet many existing models are computationally demanding, hindering their feasibility for real-time clinical applications. Additionally, the interplay between spatial and temporal features is crucial for accurate estimation but is often overlooked. In this work, we propose Echo-E$^3$Net, an efficient Endo-Epi spatio-temporal network tailored for LVEF estimation. Our method introduces the Endo-Epi Cardial Border Detector (E$^2$CBD) module, which enhances feature extraction by leveraging spatial and temporal landmark cues. Complementing this, the Endo-Epi Feature Aggregator (E$^2$FA) distills statistical descriptors from backbone feature maps, refining the final EF prediction. These modules, along with a multi-component loss function tailored to align with the clinical definition of EF, collectively enhance spatial-temporal representation learning, ensuring robust and efficient EF estimation. We evaluate Echo-E$^3$Net on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, achieving a RMSE of 5.15 and an R$^2$ score of 0.82, setting a new benchmark in efficiency with 6.8 million parameters and only 8.49G Flops.

While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Predictors in the Presence of Missing and Heterogeneous Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01701v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning approaches achieve outstanding predictive performance in modeling modern data, despite the increasing complexity and scale. However, evaluating the quality of predictive models becomes more challenging, as traditional statistical assumptions often no longer hold. In particular, spatio-temporal data exhibit dependencies across both time and space, often involving nonlinear dynamics, non-stationarities, and missing observations. As a result, advanced predictors such as spatio-temporal graph neural networks require novel evaluation methodologies. This paper introduces a residual correlation analysis framework designed to assess the optimality of spatio-temporal predictive neural models, particularly in scenarios with incomplete and heterogeneous data. By leveraging the principle that residual correlation indicates information not captured by the model, this framework serves as a powerful tool to identify and localize regions in space and time where model performance can be improved. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to operate under minimal assumptions, enabling robust evaluation of deep learning models applied to multivariate time series, even in the presence of missing and heterogeneous data. The methodology employs tailored spatio-temporal graphs to encode sparse spatial and temporal dependencies within the data and utilizes asymptotically distribution-free summary statistics to pinpoint time intervals and spatial regions where the model underperforms. The effectiveness of the proposed residual analysis is demonstrated through validation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios involving state-of-the-art predictive models.</p></details> |  |

Despite various reduction policies implemented across different sectors, PM10 concentrations in South Korea continue to exceed the annual recommended limits set by the World Health Organization. Spatio-temporal PM10 concentrations may exhibit both spatial and temporal dependencies. Additionally, interactions between PM10 and environmental factors can further influence the variability in PM10. Therefore, this study proposes a method that incorporates the spatio-temporal neighbors of covariates alongside those of PM10 by adopting an approach that explains spatio-temporal interactions through spatio-temporal neighbors. Vine copulas are used to integrate the pairwise dependence structures between a given location and its surrounding spatio-temporal neighbors. We applied the model to weekly average PM10 data from South Korea in 2019, using PM2.5 and CO as covariates. Given that all three variables exhibited skewness, we assumed the Gumbel and Generalized Extreme Value distributions as marginal distributions. The proposed model outperformed a traditional Bayesian spatio-temporal model, a kriging method, and an alternative copula-based approach, particularly in predicting the top 5% of extreme values, by effectively capturing tail dependencies crucial for extreme value analysis. This study highlights the importance of utilizing vine copulas to effectively model diverse dependency structures in spatio-temporal data while simultaneously accommodating spatial and temporal dimensions, including spatio-temporal dependencies among covariates. The results underscore the broader applicability of the proposed approach to other fields where complex dependency structures are present.</p></details> |  |

However, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) continue to encounter challenges related to low inference speed, primarily due to the iterative denoising process. To address this issue, we propose BlockDance, a training-free approach that explores feature similarities at adjacent time steps to accelerate DiTs. Unlike previous feature-reuse methods that lack tailored reuse strategies for features at different scales, BlockDance prioritizes the identification of the most structurally similar features, referred to as Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal (STSS) features. These features are primarily located within the structure-focused blocks of the transformer during the later stages of denoising. BlockDance caches and reuses these highly similar features to mitigate redundant computation, thereby accelerating DiTs while maximizing consistency with the generated results of the original model. Furthermore, considering the diversity of generated content and the varying distributions of redundant features, we introduce BlockDance-Ada, a lightweight decision-making network tailored for instance-specific acceleration. BlockDance-Ada dynamically allocates resources and provides superior content quality. Both BlockDance and BlockDance-Ada have proven effective across various generation tasks and models, achieving accelerations between 25% and 50% while maintaining generation quality.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

However, these models do not fully capture the complexity of the language learning process of an infant when used in isolation. In this paper, we examine how a model of language acquisition for infants and young children can be constructed and adapted for use in a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN), taking into account the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during child language learning. We introduce a novel approach for predicting child vocabulary acquisition, and evaluate the efficacy of such a model with respect to the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during language acquisition, resulting in insightful observations on model calibration and norm selection. An evaluation of this model found that the mean accuracy of models for predicting new words when using sensorimotor relationships (0.733) and semantic relationships (0.729) were found to be superior to that observed with a 2-layer Feed-forward neural network. Furthermore, the high recall for some relationships suggested that some relationships (e.g. visual) were superior in identifying a larger proportion of relevant words that a child should subsequently learn than others (such as auditory).</p></details> |  |

In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain.</p></details> |  |

However, restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to low-resolution ODVs. Video super-resolution (SR) is proposed to enhance resolution, but practical ODV spatial projection distortions and temporal flickering are not well addressed directly applying existing methods. To achieve better ODV-SR reconstruction, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatially continuous distortion modulation module is introduced to improve discrete projection distortions. Next, we design an interlaced multi-frame reconstruction mechanism to refine temporal consistency across frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive weights during training to concentrate on regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. In general, we explore inference-free and real-world viewing matched strategies to provide an application-friendly method on a novel ODV-SR dataset with practical scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed STDAN over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Centric Video Anomaly Detection Through Spatio-Temporal Pose Tokenization and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15185v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly due to the unpredictable and infrequent nature of anomalous events, coupled with the diverse and dynamic environments in which they occur. Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce SPARTA, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. SPARTA introduces an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion over time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism captures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than focusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further emphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's core, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches, including spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs), often face high memory demands and struggle to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies, limiting their efficiency in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce DynSTG-Mamba (Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Mamba), a novel framework that combines DF-STGNN and STG-Mamba to enhance motion sequence modeling. The DF-STGNN incorporates a dynamic spatio-temporal filter that adaptively adjusts spatial connections between skeletal joints and temporal interactions across different movement phases. This approach ensures better feature propagation through dynamic graph structures by considering the hierarchical nature and dynamics of skeletal gait data. Meanwhile, STG-Mamba, an extension of Mamba adapted for skeletal motion data, ensures a continuous propagation of states, facilitating the capture of long-term dependencies while reducing computational complexity. To reduce the number of model parameters and computational costs while maintaining consistency, we propose Cross-Graph Relational Knowledge Distillation, a novel knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns relational information between teacher (large architecture) and student models (small architecture) while using shared memory. This ensures that the interactions and movement patterns of the joints are accurately preserved in the motion sequences. We validate our DynSTG-Mamba on KOA-NM, PD-WALK, and ATAXIA datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and Recall. Our results highlight the efficiency and robustness of our approach, offering a lightweight yet highly accurate solution for automated gait analysis and movement disorder assessment.</p></details> |  |

Our approach applies query-based detection (DETR) to each frame and matches DETR queries to link the same person across frames. We introduce the Query Matching Module (QMM), which uses metric learning to bring queries for the same person closer together across frames compared to queries for different people. Action classes are predicted using the sequence of queries obtained from QMM matching, allowing for variable-length inputs from videos longer than a single clip. Experimental results on JHMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets demonstrate that our method performs well for large position changes of people while offering superior computational efficiency and lower resource requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended version of VISAPP2025</p></details> |

Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

| **[Spatio-temporal Fourier Transformer (StFT) for Long-term Dynamics Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11899v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating the long-term dynamics of multi-scale and multi-physics systems poses a significant challenge in understanding complex phenomena across science and engineering. The complexity arises from the intricate interactions between scales and the interplay of diverse physical processes. Neural operators have emerged as promising models for predicting such dynamics due to their flexibility and computational efficiency. However, they often fail to effectively capture multi-scale interactions or quantify the uncertainties inherent in the predictions. These limitations lead to rapid error accumulation, particularly in long-term forecasting of systems characterized by complex and coupled dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a spatio-temporal Fourier transformer (StFT), in which each transformer block is designed to learn dynamics at a specific scale. By leveraging a structured hierarchy of StFT blocks, the model explicitly captures dynamics across both macro- and micro- spatial scales. Furthermore, a generative residual correction mechanism is integrated to estimate and mitigate predictive uncertainties, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of long-term forecasts. Evaluations conducted on three benchmark datasets (plasma, fluid, and atmospheric dynamics) demonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art ML methods.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

However, can Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) also "reason through a sequential spatio-temporal logic" in videos? Existing Video-LLM benchmarks primarily focus on assessing object presence, neglecting relational reasoning. Consequently, it is difficult to measure whether a model truly comprehends object interactions (actions/events) in videos or merely relies on pre-trained "memory" of co-occurrences as biases in generating answers. In this work, we introduce a Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (V-STaR) benchmark to address these shortcomings. The key idea is to decompose video understanding into a Reverse Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (RSTR) task that simultaneously evaluates what objects are present, when events occur, and where they are located while capturing the underlying Chain-of-thought (CoT) logic. To support this evaluation, we construct a dataset to elicit the spatial-temporal reasoning process of Video-LLMs. It contains coarse-to-fine CoT questions generated by a semi-automated GPT-4-powered pipeline, embedding explicit reasoning chains to mimic human cognition. Experiments from 14 Video-LLMs on our V-STaR reveal significant gaps between current Video-LLMs and the needs for robust and consistent spatio-temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ben...</summary><p>A benchmark for Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning</p></details> |

Nevertheless, conventional Mamba-based models encounter significant challenges in accurately predicting stock time series, as they fail to adequately capture both the overarching market dynamics and the intricate interdependencies among individual stocks. To overcome these constraints, we introduce the Hierarchical Information-Guided Spatio-Temporal Mamba (HIGSTM) framework. HIGSTM introduces Index-Guided Frequency Filtering Decomposition to extract commonality and specificity from time series. The model architecture features a meticulously designed hierarchical framework that systematically captures both temporal dynamic patterns and global static relationships within the stock market. Furthermore, we propose an Information-Guided Mamba that integrates macro informations into the sequence selection process, thereby facilitating more market-conscious decision-making. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on the CSI500, CSI800 and CSI1000 datasets demonstrate that HIGSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Our approach processes multi-station waveform data and generates station-specific detection probabilities. Experiments show superior performance over a conventional GCN baseline in terms of true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR), highlighting its potential for robust multi-station earthquake detection.

Prior work primarily focuses on single-frame cooperative perception, which fuses agents' information across different spatial locations but ignores temporal cues and temporal tasks (e.g., temporal perception and prediction). In this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal fusion in V2X scenarios and design one-step and multi-step communication strategies (when to transmit) as well as examine their integration with three fusion strategies - early, late, and intermediate (what to transmit), providing comprehensive benchmarks with 11 fusion models (how to fuse). Furthermore, we propose V2XPnP, a novel intermediate fusion framework within one-step communication for end-to-end perception and prediction. Our framework employs a unified Transformer-based architecture to effectively model complex spatio-temporal relationships across multiple agents, frames, and high-definition map. Moreover, we introduce the V2XPnP Sequential Dataset that supports all V2X collaboration modes and addresses the limitations of existing real-world datasets, which are restricted to single-frame or single-mode cooperation. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perception and prediction tasks.

Compared to classic STVG locating only a single target, OmniSTVG enables localization of not only an arbitrary number of text-referred targets but also their interacting counterparts in the query from the video, making it more flexible and practical in real scenarios for comprehensive understanding. In order to facilitate exploration of OmniSTVG, we introduce BOSTVG, a large-scale benchmark dedicated to OmniSTVG. Specifically, our BOSTVG consists of 10,018 videos with 10.2M frames and covers a wide selection of 287 classes from diverse scenarios. Each sequence in BOSTVG, paired with a free-form textual query, encompasses a varying number of targets ranging from 1 to 10. To ensure high quality, each video is manually annotated with meticulous inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, BOSTVG is to date the first and the largest benchmark for OmniSTVG. To encourage future research, we introduce a simple yet effective approach, named OmniTube, which, drawing inspiration from Transformer-based STVG methods, is specially designed for OmniSTVG and demonstrates promising results. By releasing BOSTVG, we hope to go beyond classic STVG by locating every object appearing in the query for more comprehensive understanding, opening up a new direction for STVG. Our benchmark, model, and results will be released at https://github.com/JellyYao3000/OmniSTVG.</p></details> |  |

Traditional deep learning approaches have significantly advanced this field, particularly in the stage of ST data mining. However, these models remain task-specific and often require extensive labeled data. Inspired by the success of Foundation Models (FM), especially large language models, researchers have begun exploring the concept of Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models (STFMs) to enhance adaptability and generalization across diverse ST tasks. Unlike prior architectures, STFMs empower the entire workflow of ST data science, ranging from data sensing, management, to mining, thereby offering a more holistic and scalable approach. Despite rapid progress, a systematic study of STFMs for ST data science remains lacking. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of STFMs, categorizing existing methodologies and identifying key research directions to advance ST general intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing existing observations, spatio-temporal kriging is a method for estimating air quality at unobserved locations during a specific period. Inductive spatio-temporal kriging with increment training strategy has demonstrated its effectiveness using virtual nodes to simulate unobserved nodes. However, a disparity between virtual and real nodes persists, complicating the application of learning patterns derived from virtual nodes to actual unobserved ones. To address these limitations, this paper presents a Physics-Guided Increment Training Strategy (PGITS). Specifically, we design a dynamic graph generation module to incorporate the advection and diffusion processes of airborne particles as physical knowledge into the graph structure, dynamically adjusting the adjacency matrix to reflect physical interactions between nodes. By using physics principles as a bridge between virtual and real nodes, this strategy ensures the features of virtual nodes and their pseudo labels are closer to actual nodes. Consequently, the learned patterns of virtual nodes can be applied to actual unobserved nodes for effective kriging.</p></details> |  |

Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been ACCEPTED as a FULL PAPER at DASFAA 2025</p></details> |

As systems like autonomous driving become increasingly popular, ensuring their safety has become more important than ever. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to quickly and effectively detect various anomalies in the aforementioned systems, with the goal of making them safer and more effective. Many detection systems have been developed with great success under spatial contexts; however, there is still significant room for improvement when it comes to temporal context. While there is substantial work regarding this task, there is minimal work done regarding the efficiency of models and their ability to be applied to scenarios that require real-time inference, i.e., autonomous driving where anomalies need to be detected the moment they are within view. To address this gap, we propose STEAD (Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection), whose backbone is developed using (2+1)D Convolutions and Performer Linear Attention, which ensures computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. When tested on the UCF-Crime benchmark, our base model achieves an AUC of 91.34%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art, and our fast version achieves an AUC of 88.87%, while having 99.70% less parameters and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art as well.

Deep Learning (DL), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), have revolutionized this field by enhancing the accuracy of classification tasks. In this work, a novel approach combining a transformer-based Swin-Unet architecture with seasonal synthesized spatio-temporal images has been employed to classify LC types using spatio-temporal features extracted from Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, organized into seasonal clusters. The study focuses on three distinct regions - Amazonia, Africa, and Siberia - and evaluates the model performance across diverse ecoregions within these areas. By utilizing seasonal feature sequences instead of dense temporal sequences, notable performance improvements have been achieved, especially in regions with temporal data gaps like Siberia, where S1 data distribution is uneven and non-uniform.

Recent studies have shown that SNNs suffer from severe overfitting, which limits their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Temporal Reversal Regularization (TRR) to mitigate overfitting during training and facilitate generalization of SNNs. We exploit the inherent temporal properties of SNNs to perform input/feature temporal reversal perturbations, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and learn perturbation-invariant representations. To further enhance generalization, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (Hadamard product) for feature hybridization of original and temporally reversed spike firing rates, which expands the implicit dimensionality and acts as a spatio-temporal regularizer. We show theoretically that our method is able to tighten the upper bound of the generalization error, and extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic recognition as well as 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate its effectiveness, versatility, and adversarial robustness. In particular, our regularization significantly improves the recognition accuracy of low-latency SNN for neuromorphic objects, contributing to the real-world deployment of neuromorphic computational software-hardware integration.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Leveraging Consistent Spatio-Temporal Correspondence for Robust Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16923v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to VO have significantly improved performance by using deep networks to predict optical flow between video frames. However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DropletVideo: A Dataset and Approach to Explore Integral Spatio-Temporal Consistent Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06053v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal consistency is a critical research topic in video generation. A qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence while maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying viewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily focuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination, such as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without constraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may introduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby overlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with numerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes increasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral spatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression and camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent generation. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the development of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset, which comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object actions. Each video is annotated with an average caption of 206 words, detailing various camera movements and plot developments. Following this, we developed and trained the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving spatio-temporal coherence during video generation. The DropletVideo dataset and model are accessible at https://dropletx.github.io.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding the predictions from a model is crucial to ensure reliability and trustworthiness, particularly for high-risk applications, such as healthcare and transport. Few existing methods are able to generate explanations for models trained on continuous-time dynamic graph data and, of these, the computational complexity and lack of suitable explanation objectives pose challenges. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{S}$patio-$\textbf{T}$emporal E$\textbf{X}$planation $\textbf{Search}$ (STX-Search), a novel method for generating instance-level explanations that is applicable to static and dynamic temporal graph structures. We introduce a novel search strategy and objective function, to find explanations that are highly faithful and interpretable. When compared with existing methods, STX-Search produces explanations of higher fidelity whilst optimising explanation size to maintain interpretability.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we apply these spatio-temporal compressors to standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed prime-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the versatility of the proposed spatio-temporal compressors and verify the convergence of algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |

State-of-the-art association methods in agriculture are dedicated towards matching larger crops using either high-resolution point clouds or temporally stable features, which are both difficult to obtain for smaller fruit in the field. To address these challenges, we propose a transformer-based architecture that encodes the shape and position of each fruitlet, and propagates and refines these features through a series of transformer encoder layers with alternating self and cross-attention. We demonstrate that our method is able to achieve an F1-score of 92.4% on data collected in a commercial apple orchard and outperforms all baselines and ablations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07517v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. A computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism has recently been shown to exhibit superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. Our investigation reveals significant challenges related to stability and parameterization when employing the conventional Euler-Forward discretization for this class of models. We report a rigorous theoretical and empirical demonstration that these challenges can be effectively addressed by adopting an alternative discretization approach - the Symplectic Euler method, allowing to improve over state-of-the-art performances on common event-based benchmark datasets. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences without any normalization techniques.</p></details> |  |

Here we present new generally applicable methodology to perform this task. We introduce a parsimonious representation of seasonality and a biologically informed specification of the outbreak component to avoid parameter identifiability issues. We develop a computationally efficient Bayesian inference methodology for the proposed models, including techniques to detect outbreaks by computing marginal posterior probabilities at each spatial location and time point. We show that it is possible to efficiently integrate out the discrete parameters associated with outbreak states, enabling the use of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) as a complementary alternative to a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce a robust Bayesian model comparison framework based on importance sampling to approximate model evidence in high-dimensional space. The performance of our methodology is validated through systematic simulation studies, where simulated outbreaks were successfully detected, and our model comparison strategy demonstrates strong reliability. We also apply our new methodology to monthly incidence data on invasive meningococcal disease from 28 European countries. The results highlight outbreaks across multiple countries and months, with model comparison analysis showing that the new specification outperforms previous approaches.

To achieve this goal, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Memory Agent (STMA), a novel framework designed to enhance task planning and execution by integrating spatio-temporal memory. STMA is built upon three critical components: (1) a spatio-temporal memory module that captures historical and environmental changes in real time, (2) a dynamic knowledge graph that facilitates adaptive spatial reasoning, and (3) a planner-critic mechanism that iteratively refines task strategies. We evaluate STMA in the TextWorld environment on 32 tasks, involving multi-step planning and exploration under varying levels of complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that STMA achieves a 31.25% improvement in success rate and a 24.7% increase in average score compared to the state-of-the-art model. The results highlight the effectiveness of spatio-temporal memory in advancing the memory capabilities of embodied agents.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we explore automated pain detection using facial expressions. Our study leverages deep learning techniques to improve pain assessment by analyzing facial images from the Pain Emotion Faces Database (PEMF). We propose two novel approaches1: (1) a hybrid ConvNeXt model combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) blocks to analyze video frames and predict pain presence, and (2) a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (STGCN) integrated with LSTM to process landmarks from facial images for pain detection. Our work represents the first use of the PEMF dataset for binary pain classification and demonstrates the effectiveness of these models through extensive experimentation. The results highlight the potential of combining spatial and temporal features for enhanced pain detection, offering a promising advancement in objective pain assessment methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

| **[STGFormer: Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer for 3D Human Pose Estimation in Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10099v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current methods of video-based 3D human pose estimation have achieved significant progress.However, they still face pressing challenges, such as the underutilization of spatiotemporal bodystructure features in transformers and the inadequate granularity of spatiotemporal interaction modeling in graph convolutional networks, which leads to pervasive depth ambiguity in monocular 3D human pose estimation. To address these limitations, this paper presents the Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer framework (STGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation in videos. First, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal criss-cross Graph (STG) attention mechanism, designed to more effectively leverage the inherent graph priors of the human body within continuous sequence distributions while capturing spatiotemporal long-range dependencies. Next, we present a dual-path Modulated Hop-wise Regular GCN (MHR-GCN) to independently process temporal and spatial dimensions in parallel, preserving features rich in temporal dynamics and the original or high-dimensional representations of spatial structures. Furthermore, the module leverages modulation to optimize parameter efficiency and incorporates spatiotemporal hop-wise skip connections to capture higher-order information. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPIINF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[H-FLTN: A Privacy-Preserving Hierarchical Framework for Electric Vehicle Spatio-Temporal Charge Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18697v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) poses critical challenges for energy providers, particularly in predicting charging time (temporal prediction), ensuring user privacy, and managing resources efficiently in mobility-driven networks. This paper introduces the Hierarchical Federated Learning Transformer Network (H-FLTN) framework to address these challenges. H-FLTN employs a three-tier hierarchical architecture comprising EVs, community Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS), and the Energy Provider Data Centre (EPDC) to enable accurate spatio-temporal predictions of EV charging needs while preserving privacy. Temporal prediction is enhanced using Transformer-based learning, capturing complex dependencies in charging behavior. Privacy is ensured through Secure Aggregation, Additive Secret Sharing, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Sharing with Augmentation, which allow only secret shares of model weights to be exchanged while securing all transmissions. To improve training efficiency and resource management, H-FLTN integrates Dynamic Client Capping Mechanism (DCCM) and Client Rotation Management (CRM), ensuring that training remains both computationally and temporally efficient as the number of participating EVs increases. DCCM optimises client participation by limiting excessive computational loads, while CRM balances training contributions across epochs, preventing imbalanced participation. Our simulation results based on large-scale empirical vehicle mobility data reveal that DCCM and CRM reduce the training time complexity with increasing EVs from linear to constant. Its integration into real-world smart city infrastructure enhances energy demand forecasting, resource allocation, and grid stability, ensuring reliability and sustainability in future mobility ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 tables, 2 figures, Journal Paper</p></details> |

Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against 11 baselines.</p></details> |  |

The objective is to provide a quality score to ensure correct performance and achieve desired results. To achieve this goal, a new graph-based model, the Dense Spatio-Temporal Graph Conv-GRU Network with Transformer, is introduced. This model combines a modified version of STGCN and transformer architectures for efficient handling of spatio-temporal data. The key idea is to consider skeleton data respecting its non-linear structure as a graph and detecting joints playing the main role in each rehabilitation exercise. Dense connections and GRU mechanisms are used to rapidly process large 3D skeleton inputs and effectively model temporal dynamics. The transformer encoder's attention mechanism focuses on relevant parts of the input sequence, making it useful for evaluating rehabilitation exercises. The evaluation of our proposed approach on the KIMORE and UI-PRMD datasets highlighted its potential, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational time. This resulted in faster and more accurate learning and assessment of rehabilitation exercises. Additionally, our model provides valuable feedback through qualitative illustrations, effectively highlighting the significance of joints in specific exercises.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, Computers in Biology and Medicine Journal</p></details> |

However, traditional approaches to assess patient actions often rely on manual observation and scoring, which are subjective and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for patient action assessment using a Multi-Residual Spatio Temporal Graph Network (MR-STGN) that incorporates both angular and positional 3D skeletons. The MR-STGN is specifically designed to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of patient actions. It achieves this by integrating information from multiple residual layers, with each layer extracting features at distinct levels of abstraction. Furthermore, we integrate an attention fusion mechanism into the network, which facilitates the adaptive weighting of various features. This empowers the model to concentrate on the most pertinent aspects of the patient's movements, offering precise instructions regarding specific body parts or movements that require attention. Ablation studies are conducted to analyze the impact of individual components within the proposed model. We evaluate our model on the UI-PRMD dataset demonstrating its performance in accurately predicting real-time patient action scores, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, maintaining its adaptability under diverse object properties and complex working conditions remains challenging. This article highlights the importance of completely representing spatio-temporal features of slip, and proposes a novel approach for incipient slip modeling and detection. Based on the analysis of localized displacement phenomenon, we establish the relationship between the characteristic strain rate extreme events and the local slip state. This approach enables the detection of both the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of stick-slip regions. Also, the proposed method can be applied to strain distribution sensing devices, such as vision-based tactile sensors. Simulations and prototype experiments validated the effectiveness of this approach under varying contact conditions, including different contact geometries, friction coefficients, and combined loads. Experiments demonstrated that this method not only accurately and reliably delineates incipient slip, but also facilitates friction parameter estimation and adaptive grasping control.</p></details> | 21 pages, 19 figures |

However, most approaches are based on the assumption of the availability of and accessibility to a sufficiently dense data source, which is rather the rare case in reality. Traffic sensors in road networks are generally highly sparse in their distribution: fleet-based traffic sensing is sparse in space but also sparse in time. There are also other traffic application, besides road traffic, like moving objects in the marine space, where observations are sparsely and arbitrarily distributed in space. In this paper, we tackle the problem of traffic prediction on sparse and spatially irregular and non-deterministic traffic observations. We draw a border between imputations and this work as we consider high sparsity rates and no fixed sensor locations. We advance correlation mining methods with a Sparse Unstructured Spatio Temporal Reconstruction (SUSTeR) framework that reconstructs traffic states from sparse non-stationary observations. For the prediction the framework creates a hidden context traffic state which is enriched in a residual fashion with each observation. Such an assimilated hidden traffic state can be used by existing traffic prediction methods to predict future traffic states. We query these states with query locations from the spatial domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted and presented at ACM SIGSPATIAL '23</p></details> |

However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos. Our method demonstrates significant superiority in extensive experiments compared to current baselines.

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which are then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

With around 2000 ball events per game, their precise and exhaustive annotation based on a monocular video stream remains a tedious and costly manual task. While state-of-the-art spatio-temporal action detection methods show promise for automating this task, they lack contextual understanding of the game. Assuming professional players' behaviors are interdependent, we hypothesize that incorporating surrounding players' information such as positions, velocity and team membership can enhance purely visual predictions. We propose a spatio-temporal action detection approach that combines visual and game state information via Graph Neural Networks trained end-to-end with state-of-the-art 3D CNNs, demonstrating improved metrics through game state integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Fixed Variables: Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatio-temporal Focal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15296v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research focus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |

Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part I of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as the gold standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow and reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore, precise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between their main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately quantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences remains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and ambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we introduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level semantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a spatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing DSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet introduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel details across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and improve vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture global context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features from the encoder.

However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</p></details> |  |

They primarily emphasize temporal sharing while overlooking spatial and spectral dimensions. We propose an adaptive, AI-driven spectrum-sharing framework within the O-RAN architecture, integrating discriminative and generative AI (GenAI) to forecast spectrum needs across multiple timescales and spatial granularities. A marketplace model, managed by an authorized spectrum broker, enables operators to trade spectrum dynamically, balancing static assignments with real-time trading. GenAI enhances traffic prediction, spectrum estimation, and allocation, optimizing utilization while reducing costs. This modular, flexible approach fosters operator collaboration, maximizing efficiency and revenue. A key research challenge is refining allocation granularity and spatio-temporal dynamics beyond existing models.</p></details> |  |

Discretization in space is based on the theory of geometric quantization, which yields a spatially discretized analogue of the MHD equations as a finite-dimensional Lie--Poisson system on the dual of the magnetic extension Lie algebra $\mathfrak{f}=\mathfrak{su}(N)\ltimes\mathfrak{su}(N)^{*}$. We also give accompanying structure preserving time discretizations for Lie--Poisson systems on the dual of semi-direct product Lie algebras of the form $\mathfrak{f}=\mathfrak{g}\ltimes\mathfrak{g^{*}}$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is a $J$-quadratic Lie algebra. The time integration method is free of computationally costly matrix exponentials. We prove that the full method preserves a modified Lie--Poisson structure and corresponding Casimir functions, and that the modified structure and Casimirs converge to the continuous ones. The method is demonstrated for two models of magnetic fluids: incompressible magnetohydrodynamics and Hazeltine's model.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, convergence results for Casimirs added in sect. 3, typos corrected</p></details> |

We propose AQ-Net, a spatiotemporal reanalysis model for both observed and unobserved stations in the near future. AQ-Net utilizes the LSTM and multi-head attention for the temporal regression. We also propose a cyclic encoding technique to ensure continuous time representation. To learn fine-grained spatial air quality estimation, we incorporate AQ-Net with the neural kNN to explore feature-based interpolation, such that we can fill the spatial gaps given coarse observation stations. To demonstrate the efficiency of our model for spatiotemporal reanalysis, we use data from 2013-2017 collected in northern China for PM2.5 analysis. Extensive experiments show that AQ-Net excels in air quality reanalysis, highlighting the potential of hybrid spatio-temporal models to better capture environmental dynamics, especially in urban areas where both spatial and temporal variability are critical.</p></details> |  |

By using the robust capabilities of the MediaPipe as a computer vision library and the DeepFace as an emotion recognition library, this research endeavors to capture the subtleties of human head motion, including blink actions and emotional expressions, and seamlessly incorporate these indicators into the robot's responses. The result is a comprehensive framework which facilitates precise head imitation within human-robot interactions, utilizing a closed-loop approach that involves gathering real-time feedback from the robot's imitation performance. This feedback loop ensures a high degree of accuracy in modeling head motion, as evidenced by an impressive R2 score of 96.3 for pitch and 98.9 for yaw. Notably, the proposed approach holds promise in improving communication for children with autism, offering them a valuable tool for more effective interaction. In essence, proposed work explores the integration of real-time head imitation and real-time emotion recognition to enhance human-robot interactions, with potential benefits for individuals with unique communication needs.</p></details> |  |

For this reason, over time, several frameworks for quadrupedal locomotion have been proposed, but with little attention to ensuring a predictable timing behavior of the controller. To address this issue, this work presents \NAME, a modular control framework for quadrupedal locomotion suitable for execution on an embedded system under hard real-time execution constraints. It leverages the feedback linearization control technique to obtain a closed-form control law for the body, valid for all configurations of the robot. The control law was derived after defining an appropriate rigid body model that uses the accelerations of the feet as control variables, instead of the estimated contact forces. This work also provides a novel algorithm to compute footholds and gait temporal parameters using the concept of imaginary wheels, and a heuristic algorithm to select the best gait schedule for the current velocity commands. The proposed framework is developed entirely in C++, with no dependencies on third-party libraries and no dynamic memory allocation, to ensure predictability and real-time performance. Its implementation allows \NAME\ to be both compiled and executed on an embedded system for critical applications, as well as integrated into larger systems such as Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2). For this reason, \NAME\ has been tested in both scenarios, demonstrating satisfactory results both in terms of reference tracking and temporal predictability, whether integrated into ROS 2 or compiled as a standalone application on a Raspberry Pi 5.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[On Stopping Times of Power-one Sequential Tests: Tight Lower and Upper Bounds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19952v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We prove two lower bounds for stopping times of sequential tests between general composite nulls and alternatives. The first lower bound is for the setting where the type-1 error level $\alpha$ approaches zero, and equals $\log(1/\alpha)$ divided by a certain infimum KL divergence, termed $\operatorname{KL_{inf}}$. The second lower bound applies to the setting where $\alpha$ is fixed and $\operatorname{KL_{inf}}$ approaches 0 (meaning that the null and alternative sets are not separated) and equals $c \operatorname{KL_{inf}}^{-1} \log \log \operatorname{KL_{inf}}^{-1}$ for a universal constant $c > 0$. We also provide a sufficient condition for matching the upper bounds and show that this condition is met in several special cases. Given past work, these upper and lower bounds are unsurprising in their form; our main contribution is the generality in which they hold, for example, not requiring reference measures or compactness of the classes.</p></details> | 36 pages |

We propose a novel, interpretable additive model tailored for such data, designed to deliver both high predictive accuracy and clear interpretability. The model features bivariate coefficient surfaces to represent relationships across panel dimensions, with sparsity introduced via penalized smoothing and group bridge regression. This enables simultaneous estimation of the surfaces and identification of significant inter-dimensional effects. Through Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application to Japanese subnational age-specific mortality rates, we demonstrate the proposed model's superior forecasting performance and interpretability compared to existing functional time series approaches.</p></details> |  |

It enables users to adjust their communication strategies dynamically, thereby improving the effectiveness of their communication. Generative AI holds significant potential to enhance real-time reflection due to its ability to comprehensively understand the current context and generate personalized and nuanced content. However, it is challenging to design the way of interaction and information presentation to support the real-time workflow rather than disrupt it. In this position paper, we present a review of existing research on systems designed for reflection in different synchronous communication scenarios. Based on that, we discuss design implications on how to design human-AI interaction to support reflection in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 ACM Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for Augmented Reasoning, Report Number: CHI25-WS-AUGMENTED-REASONING</p></details> |
| **[Optimal real-time dynamic treatment regimes with application to oxytocin use in preventing postpartum hemorrhage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19831v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time dynamic treatment regimes (real-time DTRs) refers to decision rules that personalize patient treatment in real-time based on treatment and covariate histories. These rules are crucial for real-time clinical decision support systems and automated drug delivery systems for chronic diseases. Although considerable statistical and machine learning DTR methods have been developed, they are designed for a small number of fixed decision points, and thus can not adapt to real-time cases. This paper proposes a new semiparametric Bayesian method for estimating an optimal treatment regime in real-time, which allows for the existence of latent individual level variables. Specifically, random real-time DTRs are defined through interventional parameters, the optimal values of which are estimated by maximizing the posterior predictive utility. The proposed approach is compared with alternative methods using simulated datasets, and applied to estimate the optimal real-time oxytocin administration regime for preventing postpartum hemorrhage.</p></details> |  |
| **[SILENT: A New Lens on Statistics in Software Timing Side Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19821v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cryptographic research takes software timing side channels seriously. Approaches to mitigate them include constant-time coding and techniques to enforce such practices. However, recent attacks like Meltdown [42], Spectre [37], and Hertzbleed [70] have challenged our understanding of what it means for code to execute in constant time on modern CPUs. To ensure that assumptions on the underlying hardware are correct and to create a complete feedback loop, developers should also perform \emph{timing measurements} as a final validation step to ensure the absence of exploitable side channels. Unfortunately, as highlighted by a recent study by Jancar et al. [30], developers often avoid measurements due to the perceived unreliability of the statistical analysis and its guarantees. In this work, we combat the view that statistical techniques only provide weak guarantees by introducing a new algorithm for the analysis of timing measurements with strong, formal statistical guarantees, giving developers a reliable analysis tool. Specifically, our algorithm (1) is non-parametric, making minimal assumptions about the underlying distribution and thus overcoming limitations of classical tests like the t-test, (2) handles unknown data dependencies in measurements, (3) can estimate in advance how many samples are needed to detect a leak of a given size, and (4) allows the definition of a negligible leak threshold $\Delta$, ensuring that acceptable non-exploitable leaks do not trigger false positives, without compromising statistical soundness. We demonstrate the necessity, effectiveness, and benefits of our approach on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

During this era, prompt engineering emerged as our primary interface with AI, enabling dialogue-level communication through natural language. We now witness the emergence of "Act II" (2024-present), where models are transitioning from knowledge-retrieval systems (in latent space) to thought-construction engines through test-time scaling techniques. This new paradigm establishes a mind-level connection with AI through language-based thoughts. In this paper, we clarify the conceptual foundations of cognition engineering and explain why this moment is critical for its development. We systematically break down these advanced approaches through comprehensive tutorials and optimized implementations, democratizing access to cognition engineering and enabling every practitioner to participate in AI's second act.

| **[Multimodal Conditioned Diffusive Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19669v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models achieve remarkable success in processing images and text, and have been extended to special domains such as time series forecasting (TSF). Existing diffusion-based approaches for TSF primarily focus on modeling single-modality numerical sequences, overlooking the rich multimodal information in time series data. To effectively leverage such information for prediction, we propose a multimodal conditioned diffusion model for TSF, namely, MCD-TSF, to jointly utilize timestamps and texts as extra guidance for time series modeling, especially for forecasting. Specifically, Timestamps are combined with time series to establish temporal and semantic correlations among different data points when aggregating information along the temporal dimension. Texts serve as supplementary descriptions of time series' history, and adaptively aligned with data points as well as dynamically controlled in a classifier-free manner. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets across eight domains demonstrate that the proposed MCD-TSF model achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAN-SLAM: Real-Time GAN Aided Floor Plan Creation Through SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19653v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SLAM is a fundamental component of modern autonomous systems, providing robots and their operators with a deeper understanding of their environment. SLAM systems often encounter challenges due to the dynamic nature of robotic motion, leading to inaccuracies in mapping quality, particularly in 2D representations such as Occupancy Grid Maps. These errors can significantly degrade map quality, hindering the effectiveness of specific downstream tasks such as floor plan creation. To address this challenge, we introduce our novel 'GAN-SLAM', a new SLAM approach that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks to clean and complete occupancy grids during the SLAM process, reducing the impact of noise and inaccuracies introduced on the output map. We adapt and integrate accurate pose estimation techniques typically used for 3D SLAM into a 2D form. This enables the quality improvement 3D LiDAR-odometry has seen in recent years to be effective for 2D representations. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in map fidelity and quality, with minimal noise and errors, affirming the effectiveness of GAN-SLAM for real-world mapping applications within large-scale complex environments. We validate our approach on real-world data operating in real-time, and on famous examples of 2D maps. The improved quality of the output map enables new downstream tasks, such as floor plan drafting, further enhancing the capabilities of autonomous systems. Our novel approach to SLAM offers a significant step forward in the field, improving the usability for SLAM in mapping-based tasks, and offers insight into the usage of GANs for OGM error correction.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, preprint conference submission</p></details> |

Accurate and real-time 3D meshing of these environments is essential for applications including automated structural assessment, robotic-assisted inspection, and safety monitoring. Implicit neural Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) have shown promising capabilities in online meshing; however, existing methods often suffer from large projection errors and rely on fixed reconstruction parameters, limiting their adaptability to complex and unstructured underground environments such as tunnels, caves, and lava tubes. To address these challenges, this paper proposes ARMOR, a scene-adaptive and reinforcement learning-based framework for real-time 3D meshing in unexposed environments. The proposed method was validated across more than 3,000 meters of underground environments, including engineered tunnels, natural caves, and lava tubes. Experimental results demonstrate that ARMOR achieves superior performance in real-time mesh reconstruction, reducing geometric error by 3.96\% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining real-time efficiency. The method exhibits improved robustness, accuracy, and adaptability, indicating its potential for advanced 3D monitoring and mapping in challenging unexposed scenarios.

The length extrapolation capability in TF-domain dual-path models is a crucial factor, as it affects not only their performance on long-duration inputs but also their generalizability to signals with unseen sampling rates. While PE is known to significantly impact length extrapolation, there has been limited research that explores the choice of PEs for TF-domain dual-path models from this perspective. To address this gap, we compare various PE methods using a recent state-of-the-art model, TF-Locoformer, as the base architecture. Our analysis yields the following key findings: (i) When handling sequences that are the same length as or shorter than those seen during training, models with PEs achieve better performance. (ii) However, models without PE exhibit superior length extrapolation. This trend is particularly pronounced when the model contains convolutional layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |

Here we present a novel approach using Bayesian analysis for change point problems (BCP) applied to Sentinel-1 SAR time series data, which automatically detects temporal discontinuities in backscatter patterns to distinguish flood inundation from permanent water bodies without requiring training data or ancillary information. We validate our method using the UrbanSARFloods benchmark dataset across three diverse geographical contexts (Weihui, China; Jubba, Somalia; and NovaKakhovka, Ukraine). Our BCP approach achieves F1 scores ranging from 0.41 to 0.76 (IoU: 0.25-0.61), significantly outperforming both OTSU thresholding (F1: 0.03-0.12, IoU: 0.02-0.08) and Siamese convolutional neural network approaches (F1: 0.08-0.34, IoU: 0.05-0.24). Further analysis reveals exceptional performance in open areas with F1 scores of 0.47-0.81 (IoU: 0.31-0.68) and high recall (0.36-0.84), contrasted with substantially lower performance in urban areas (F1: 0.00-0.01, IoU: 0.00-0.01), indicating a common challenge across current flood detection methods in urban environments. The proposed method's ability to process raw SAR data directly with minimal preprocessing enables integration into operational early warning systems for rapid flood mapping, particularly in agricultural and open landscapes where it demonstrates the strongest performance.</p></details> |  |

However, the parameter convergence rate is limited for the gradient-based method owing to small parameter update gain, and even the introduction of forgetting factors does not work sufficiently. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel discrete-time recursive least squares method under finite excitation (FE) conditions using two forgetting factors (inner and outer) and an augmented regressor matrix comprising a sum of regressor vectors. The proposed method ensures the PE condition of the augmented regressor matrix under FE conditions of the regressor vector and allows the properly design of the forgetting factor without estimator windup and/or destabilization of the system. Numerical simulations demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing it with several conventional methods.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Furthermore, our GAN-based method drastically reduces the computation time, achieving a 5X speedup on complex benchmarks. In practice, it can compute the signal strength in a few milliseconds on any location in 3D indoor environments. We also present a large dataset of 3D models and EM ray tracing-simulated heatmaps. To the best of our knowledge, EM-GANSim is the first real-time algorithm for EM simulation in complex 3D indoor environments.

While previous studies have addressed scenarios involving stationary targets or those moving with an unknown constant velocity, the challenge of accurately tracking a target moving with a time-varying velocity remains open. This paper presents an approach utilising a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based estimator for predicting the target's position and velocity. We also introduce a corresponding control strategy. When evaluated against previously proposed estimation and circumnavigation approaches, our approach demonstrates significantly lower control and estimation errors across various time-varying velocity scenarios.

Unlike prior methods, which rely heavily on training data (often inaccessible during online inference) and are limited to recognizing a fixed set of point cloud classes predefined during training, we explore a more practical and challenging scenario: adapting the model solely based on online test data to recognize both previously seen classes and novel, unseen classes at test time. To this end, we develop \textbf{Point-Cache}, a hierarchical cache model that captures essential clues of online test samples, particularly focusing on the global structure of point clouds and their local-part details. Point-Cache, which serves as a rich 3D knowledge base, is dynamically managed to prioritize the inclusion of high-quality samples.

Unlike conventional captioning systems that offer only plain text, our system fuses real-time speech recognition with affective and visual signal interpretation, including facial movements, gestures, and vocal tone, to produce emotionally enriched captions. These enhanced captions are rendered in an AR interface developed with Unity and provide contextual annotations such as speaker tone markers (e.g., "concerned") and gesture indicators (e.g., "nods"). The system leverages live camera and microphone input, processed through AI models to detect multimodal cues. Findings from preliminary evaluations suggest that this AR-based captioning approach significantly enhances comprehension and reduces cognitive effort compared to standard captions. Our work emphasizes the potential of immersive environments for inclusive, emotion-aware educational accessibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor correction to references for better citation matching</p></details> |
| **[A Real-Time Event-Based Normal Flow Estimator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19417v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a real-time, asynchronous, event-based normal flow estimator. It follows the same algorithm as Learning Normal Flow Directly From Event Neighborhoods, but with a more optimized implementation. The original method treats event slices as 3D point clouds, encodes each event's local geometry into a fixed-length vector, and uses a multi-layer perceptron to predict normal flow. It constructs representations by multiplying an adjacency matrix with a feature matrix, resulting in quadratic time complexity with respect to the number of events. In contrast, we leverage the fact that event coordinates are integers and reformulate the representation step as a pooling operation. This achieves the same effect as the adjacency matrix but with much lower computational cost. As a result, our method supports real-time normal flow prediction on event cameras. Our estimator uses 1 GB of CUDA memory and runs at 4 million normal flows per second on an RTX 3070, or 6 million per second on an RTX A5000. We release the CUDA implementation along with a Python interface at https://github.com/dhyuan99/VecKM_flow_cpp.</p></details> |  |

While several prior works have obtained a mean square error bound of $O(1/k)$ for linear two-time-scale iterations, the best known bound in the non-linear contractive setting has been $O(1/k^{2/3})$. In this work, we obtain an improved bound of $O(1/k)$ for non-linear two-time-scale stochastic approximation. Our result applies to algorithms such as gradient descent-ascent and two-time-scale Lagrangian optimization. The key step in our analysis involves rewriting the original iteration in terms of an averaged noise sequence which decays sufficiently fast. Additionally, we use an induction-based approach to show that the iterates are bounded in expectation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |

However, the systematic synthesis of DTCBFs in a computationally efficient way is at present an important open problem. This article first proposes a novel alternating-descent approach based on Sum-of-Squares programming to synthesize quadratic DTCBFs and corresponding polynomial control policies for discrete-time control-affine polynomial systems with input constraints and semi-algebraic safe sets. Subsequently, two distinct approaches are introduced to extend the proposed method to the synthesis of higher-degree polynomial DTCBFs. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply the proposed method to numerical case studies.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods suffer from imprecise instance segmentation, static semantic updates, and limited handling of complex queries. To address these issues, we present OpenFusion++, a TSDF-based real-time 3D semantic-geometric reconstruction system. Our approach refines 3D point clouds by fusing confidence maps from foundational models, dynamically updates global semantic labels via an adaptive cache based on instance area, and employs a dual-path encoding framework that integrates object attributes with environmental context for precise query responses. Experiments on the ICL, Replica, ScanNet, and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrate that OpenFusion++ significantly outperforms the baseline in both semantic accuracy and query responsiveness.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

However, current frameworks often adopt distinct perspectives on three key aspects: task definition, LLM profiling, and search procedures, making direct comparisons challenging. Moreover, the search algorithms employed often diverge from standard implementations, and their specific characteristics are not thoroughly specified. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive but integrated technical review on existing LIS frameworks. Specifically, we unify task definitions under Markov Decision Process (MDP) and provides modular definitions of LLM profiling and search procedures. The definitions enable precise comparisons of various LLM inference frameworks while highlighting their departures from conventional search algorithms. We also discuss the applicability, performance, and efficiency of these methods.

| **[Making Physical Objects with Generative AI and Robotic Assembly: Considering Fabrication Constraints, Sustainability, Time, Functionality, and Accessibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19131v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D generative AI enables rapid and accessible creation of 3D models from text or image inputs. However, translating these outputs into physical objects remains a challenge due to the constraints in the physical world. Recent studies have focused on improving the capabilities of 3D generative AI to produce fabricable outputs, with 3D printing as the main fabrication method. However, this workshop paper calls for a broader perspective by considering how fabrication methods align with the capabilities of 3D generative AI. As a case study, we present a novel system using discrete robotic assembly and 3D generative AI to make physical objects. Through this work, we identified five key aspects to consider in a physical making process based on the capabilities of 3D generative AI. 1) Fabrication Constraints: Current text-to-3D models can generate a wide range of 3D designs, requiring fabrication methods that can adapt to the variability of generative AI outputs. 2) Time: While generative AI can generate 3D models in seconds, fabricating physical objects can take hours or even days. Faster production could enable a closer iterative design loop between humans and AI in the making process. 3) Sustainability: Although text-to-3D models can generate thousands of models in the digital world, extending this capability to the real world would be resource-intensive, unsustainable and irresponsible. 4) Functionality: Unlike digital outputs from 3D generative AI models, the fabrication method plays a crucial role in the usability of physical objects. 5) Accessibility: While generative AI simplifies 3D model creation, the need for fabrication equipment can limit participation, making AI-assisted creation less inclusive. These five key aspects provide a framework for assessing how well a physical making process aligns with the capabilities of 3D generative AI and values in the world.</p></details> |  |

Accurate and timely monitoring of maritime activity is an essential step to effective governance and to inform future policy. In support of this complex global-scale effort, we built Atlantes, a deep learning based system that provides the first-ever real-time view of vessel behavior at global scale. Atlantes leverages a series of bespoke transformers to distill a high volume, continuous stream of GPS messages emitted by hundreds of thousands of vessels into easily quantifiable behaviors. The combination of low latency and high performance enables operationally relevant decision-making and successful interventions on the high seas where illegal and exploitative activity is too common. Atlantes is already in use by hundreds of organizations worldwide.

This problem is naturally formulated as a nonconvex program. To solve it, we propose a biconvex method that quickly produces an initial trajectory and iteratively refines it by solving two convex subproblems in alternation. This method is guaranteed to converge, returns a feasible trajectory even if stopped early, and does not require the selection of any line-search or trust-region parameter. Exhaustive experiments show that our method finds high-quality trajectories in a fraction of the time of state-of-the-art solvers for nonconvex optimization. In addition, it achieves runtimes comparable to industry-standard waypoint-based motion planners, while consistently designing lower-duration trajectories than existing optimization-based planners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transparent Transformations for Timing Side-Channel Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04183v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Side-channel analysis frameworks often lift programs into an intermediate representation (IR) before analyzing them. IRs are subject to transformations, which we call ex ante (XA) transformations, that improve the efficiency and accuracy of the analysis, thereby directly impacting the validity of analysis results. This paper explores the impact of XA transformations in the setting of timing-based side-channel analysis frameworks, focusing on the constant-time policy that many cryptographic libraries adopt. We identify two properties of XA transformations that directly impact the soundness and precision of side-channel analysis. The first property, preservation, requires that the transformation does not introduce leakage and is required to avoid false positives, i.e., for precision. The second one, reflection, requires that the transformation does not remove leakage and is required to avoid false negatives, i.e., for soundness. The combination of preservation and reflection, which we call transparency, is essential for sound and precise transformations. While preservation has been studied in the context of secure compilation, there is little work on reflection. This paper initiates the study of reflection and transparency. We formalize their definitions, propose a general method for proving that a transformation is transparent, and apply our method to different standard transformations. Subsequently, we present a transparent decompiler that combines seven XA transformations and prove that it is sound and precise. Additionally, we review the transparency of five existing tools and unveil violations in popular side-channel analysis frameworks and decompilers. Finally, we extend our approach to the setting of speculative side-channels. We redefine transparency of transformations with respect to Spectre attacks, and reevaluate the XA transformations for transparency w.r.t. Spectre.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time High-fidelity Gaussian Human Avatars with Position-based Interpolation of Spatially Distributed MLPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12909v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many works have succeeded in reconstructing Gaussian human avatars from multi-view videos. However, they either struggle to capture pose-dependent appearance details with a single MLP, or rely on a computationally intensive neural network to reconstruct high-fidelity appearance but with rendering performance degraded to non-real-time. We propose a novel Gaussian human avatar representation that can reconstruct high-fidelity pose-dependence appearance with details and meanwhile can be rendered in real time. Our Gaussian avatar is empowered by spatially distributed MLPs which are explicitly located on different positions on human body. The parameters stored in each Gaussian are obtained by interpolating from the outputs of its nearby MLPs based on their distances. To avoid undesired smooth Gaussian property changing during interpolation, for each Gaussian we define a set of Gaussian offset basis, and a linear combination of basis represents the Gaussian property offsets relative to the neutral properties. Then we propose to let the MLPs output a set of coefficients corresponding to the basis. In this way, although Gaussian coefficients are derived from interpolation and change smoothly, the Gaussian offset basis is learned freely without constraints. The smoothly varying coefficients combined with freely learned basis can still produce distinctly different Gaussian property offsets, allowing the ability to learn high-frequency spatial signals. We further use control points to constrain the Gaussians distributed on a surface layer rather than allowing them to be irregularly distributed inside the body, to help the human avatar generalize better when animated under novel poses. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, our method achieves better appearance quality with finer details while the rendering speed is significantly faster under novel views and novel poses.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

The architecture is structured around CNN-based representation layers, each dedicated to an independent representation learning task and designed to capture diverse temporal patterns, followed by an attention-based feature extraction layer and a merge layer, designed to aggregate extracted features. The architecture is fundamentally based on a configuration that is inspired by a Transformer encoder, with self-attention mechanisms at its core. The TSRM architecture outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on most of the seven established benchmark datasets considered in our empirical evaluation for both forecasting and imputation tasks. At the same time, it significantly reduces complexity in the form of learnable parameters. The source code is available at https://github.com/RobertLeppich/TSRM.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAMEN: Real-time Asynchronous Multi-agent Neural Implicit Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19592v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent neural implicit mapping allows robots to collaboratively capture and reconstruct complex environments with high fidelity. However, existing approaches often rely on synchronous communication, which is impractical in real-world scenarios with limited bandwidth and potential communication interruptions. This paper introduces RAMEN: Real-time Asynchronous Multi-agEnt Neural implicit mapping, a novel approach designed to address this challenge. RAMEN employs an uncertainty-weighted multi-agent consensus optimization algorithm that accounts for communication disruptions. When communication is lost between a pair of agents, each agent retains only an outdated copy of its neighbor's map, with the uncertainty of this copy increasing over time since the last communication. Using gradient update information, we quantify the uncertainty associated with each parameter of the neural network map. Neural network maps from different agents are brought to consensus on the basis of their levels of uncertainty, with consensus biased towards network parameters with lower uncertainty. To achieve this, we derive a weighted variant of the decentralized consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (C-ADMM) algorithm, facilitating robust collaboration among agents with varying communication and update frequencies. Through extensive evaluations on real-world datasets and robot hardware experiments, we demonstrate RAMEN's superior mapping performance under challenging communication conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Digital Twins: Robust Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Quantile Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10337v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital Twins, virtual replicas of physical systems that enable real-time monitoring, model updates, predictions, and decision-making, present novel avenues for proactive control strategies for autonomous systems. However, achieving real-time decision-making in Digital Twins considering uncertainty necessitates an efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach and optimization driven by accurate predictions of system behaviors, which remains a challenge for learning-based methods. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that incorporates real-time decision-making with uncertainty awareness for Digital Twin systems. Leveraging a multistep ahead predictor named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE) as the surrogate model, this framework differs from conventional MPC models that provide only one-step ahead predictions. In contrast, TiDE can predict future states within the prediction horizon in a one-shot, significantly accelerating MPC. Furthermore, quantile regression is employed with the training of TiDE to perform flexible while computationally efficient UQ on data uncertainty. Consequently, with the deep learning quantiles, the robust MPC problem is formulated into a deterministic optimization problem and provides a safety buffer that accommodates disturbances to enhance constraint satisfaction rate. As a result, the proposed method outperforms existing robust MPC methods by providing less-conservative UQ and has demonstrated efficacy in an engineering case study involving Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing. This proactive while uncertainty-aware control capability positions the proposed method as a potent tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process control in engineering systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version is obsolete and does not reflect the final or intended results.

In this work, we develop a system to generate personalized medical intervention strategies based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Time-Series Data Fusion. First, by incorporating relative policy constraints among the groups during policy gradient updates, we adaptively balance individual and group gains. To improve the robustness and interpretability of decision-making, a multi-layer neural network structure is employed to group-code patient characteristics. Second, for the rapid multi-modal fusion of multi-source heterogeneous time series, a multi-channel neural network combined with a self-attention mechanism is used for dynamic feature extraction. Key feature screening and aggregation are achieved through a differentiable gating network. Finally, a collaborative search process combining a genetic algorithm and Monte Carlo tree search is proposed to find the ideal intervention strategy, achieving global optimization. Experimental results show significant improvements in accuracy, coverage, and decision-making benefits compared with existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fairness Is More Than Algorithms: Racial Disparities in Time-to-Recidivism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18629v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Racial disparities in recidivism remain a persistent challenge within the criminal justice system, increasingly exacerbated by the adoption of algorithmic risk assessment tools. Past works have primarily focused on bias induced by these tools, treating recidivism as a binary outcome. Limited attention has been given to non-algorithmic factors (including socioeconomic ones) in driving racial disparities from a systemic perspective. To that end, this work presents a multi-stage causal framework to investigate the advent and extent of disparities by considering time-to-recidivism rather than a simple binary outcome. The framework captures interactions among races, the algorithm, and contextual factors. This work introduces the notion of counterfactual racial disparity and offers a formal test using survival analysis that can be conducted with observational data to assess if differences in recidivism arise from algorithmic bias, contextual factors, or their interplay. In particular, it is formally established that if sufficient statistical evidence for differences across racial groups is observed, it would support rejecting the null hypothesis that non-algorithmic factors (including socioeconomic ones) do not affect recidivism. An empirical study applying this framework to the COMPAS dataset reveals that short-term recidivism patterns do not exhibit racial disparities when controlling for risk scores. However, statistically significant disparities emerge with longer follow-up periods, particularly for low-risk groups. This suggests that factors beyond algorithmic scores, possibly structural disparities in housing, employment, and social support, may accumulate and exacerbate recidivism risks over time. This underscores the need for policy interventions extending beyond algorithmic improvements to address broader influences on recidivism trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional Decoding: Improving Action Chunking via Guided Test-Time Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17355v4)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting and executing a sequence of actions without intermediate replanning, known as action chunking, is increasingly used in robot learning from human demonstrations. Yet, its effects on the learned policy remain inconsistent: some studies find it crucial for achieving strong results, while others observe decreased performance. In this paper, we first dissect how action chunking impacts the divergence between a learner and a demonstrator. We find that action chunking allows the learner to better capture the temporal dependencies in demonstrations but at the cost of reduced reactivity to unexpected states. To address this tradeoff, we propose Bidirectional Decoding (BID), a test-time inference algorithm that bridges action chunking with closed-loop adaptation. At each timestep, BID samples multiple candidate predictions and searches for the optimal one based on two criteria: (i) backward coherence, which favors samples that align with previous decisions; (ii) forward contrast, which seeks samples of high likelihood for future plans. By coupling decisions within and across action chunks, BID promotes both long-term consistency and short-term reactivity. Experimental results show that our method boosts the performance of two state-of-the-art generative policies across seven simulation benchmarks and two real-world tasks.

In this work, we propose TimerBed, the first comprehensive testbed for evaluating LLMs' TsR performance. Specifically, TimerBed includes stratified reasoning patterns with real-world tasks, comprehensive combinations of LLMs and reasoning strategies, and various supervised models as comparison anchors. We perform extensive experiments with TimerBed, test multiple current beliefs, and verify the initial failures of LLMs in TsR, evidenced by the ineffectiveness of zero shot (ZST) and performance degradation of few shot in-context learning (ICL). Further, we identify one possible root cause: the numerical modeling of data. To address this, we propose a prompt-based solution VL-Time, using visualization-modeled data and language-guided reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Vl-Time enables multimodal LLMs to be non-trivial ZST and powerful ICL reasoners for time series, achieving about 140% average performance improvement and 99% average token costs reduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Dwell-times for Switched Nonlinear Systems using Memory Regression Extension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18457v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a switched systems approach for extending the dwell-time of an autonomous agent during GPS-denied operation by leveraging memory regressor extension (MRE) techniques. To maintain accurate trajectory tracking despite unknown dynamics and environmental disturbances, the agent periodically acquires access to GPS, allowing it to correct accumulated state estimation errors. The motivation for this work arises from the limitations of existing switched system approaches, where increasing estimation errors during GPS-denied intervals and overly conservative dwell-time conditions restrict the operational efficiency of the agent. By leveraging MRE techniques during GPS-available intervals, the developed method refines the estimates of unknown system parameters, thereby enabling longer and more reliable operation in GPS-denied environments. A Lyapunov-based switched-system stability analysis establishes that improved parameter estimates obtained through concurrent learning allow extended operation in GPS-denied intervals without compromising closed-loop system stability. Simulation results validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating dwell-time extensions and enhanced trajectory tracking performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subexponential and Parameterized Mixing Times of Glauber Dynamics on Independent Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18427v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a graph $G$, the hard-core model defines a probability distribution over its independent sets, assigning to each set of size $k$ a probability of $\frac{\lambda^k}{Z}$, where $\lambda>0$ is a parameter known as the fugacity and $Z$ is a normalization constant. The Glauber dynamics is a simple Markov chain that converges to this distribution and enables efficient sampling. Its mixing time--the number of steps needed to approach the stationary distribution--has been widely studied across various graph classes, with most previous work emphasizing the dichotomy between polynomial and exponential mixing times, with a particular focus on sparse classes of graphs. Inspired by the modern fine-grained approach to computational complexity, we investigate subexponential mixing times of the Glauber dynamics on geometric intersection graphs, such as disk graphs. We also study parameterized mixing times by focusing on two structural parameters that can remain small even in dense graphs: the tree independence number and the path independence number. We show that Glauber dynamics mixes in polynomial time on graphs with bounded path independence number and in quasi-polynomial time when the tree independence number is bounded. Moreover, we prove both bounds are tight, revealing a clear separation between the two parameters. This work provides a simple and efficient algorithm for sampling from the hard-core model. Unlike classical approaches that rely explicitly on geometric representations or on constructing decompositions such as tree decompositions or separator trees, our analysis only requires their existence to establish mixing time bounds--these structures are not used directly by the algorithm itself.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, due to the outstanding performance of deep learning in general sequential tasks, many models have been specialized for deep UMTSAD tasks and have achieved impressive results, particularly those based on the Transformer and self-attention mechanisms. However, the sequence anomaly association assumptions underlying these models are often limited to specific predefined patterns and scenarios, such as concentrated or peak anomaly patterns. These limitations hinder their ability to generalize to diverse anomaly situations, especially where the lack of labels poses significant challenges. To address these issues, we propose AMAD, which integrates \textbf{A}uto\textbf{M}asked Attention for UMTS\textbf{AD} scenarios. AMAD introduces a novel structure based on the AutoMask mechanism and an attention mixup module, forming a simple yet generalized anomaly association representation framework. This framework is further enhanced by a Max-Min training strategy and a Local-Global contrastive learning approach. By combining multi-scale feature extraction with automatic relative association modeling, AMAD provides a robust and adaptable solution to UMTSAD challenges. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieving competitive performance results compared to SOTA benchmarks across a variety of datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>fix s...</summary><p>fix some grammar issues</p></details> |

Although scientific machine learning (SciML) techniques offer approximate solutions, they often suffer from bias and neglect crucial physical insights. Inspired by inference-time scaling strategies in language models, we propose Simulation-Calibrated Scientific Machine Learning (SCaSML), a physics-informed framework that dynamically refines and debiases the SCiML predictions during inference by enforcing the physical laws. SCaSML leverages derived new physical laws that quantifies systematic errors and employs Monte Carlo solvers based on the Feynman-Kac and Elworthy-Bismut-Li formulas to dynamically correct the prediction. Both numerical and theoretical analysis confirms enhanced convergence rates via compute-optimal inference methods. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that SCaSML reduces errors by 20-50% compared to the base surrogate model, establishing it as the first algorithm to refine approximated solutions to high-dimensional PDE during inference. Code of SCaSML is available at https://github.com/Francis-Fan-create/SCaSML.</p></details> |  |

In this context, the notion of $\delta$-ISS control Lyapunov function ($\delta$-ISS-CLF) for the continuous-time system is introduced. Combined with the controller, the $\delta$-ISS-CLF guarantees that the system is incrementally stable. As the paper deals with unknown dynamical systems, the controller as well as the $\delta$-ISS-CLF are parametrized using neural networks. The data set used to train the neural networks is generated from the state space of the system by proper sampling. Now, to give a formal guarantee that the controller makes the system incrementally stable, we develop a validity condition by having some Lipschitz continuity assumptions and incorporate the condition into the training framework to ensure a provable correctness guarantee at the end of the training process. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through several case studies: a scalar system with a non-affine, non-polynomial structure, a one-link manipulator system, a nonlinear Moore-Greitzer model of a jet engine, and a rotating rigid spacecraft model.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.04129</p></details> |
| **[PHEATPRUNER: Interpretable Data-centric Feature Selection for Multivariate Time Series Classification through Persistent Homology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18329v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Balancing performance and interpretability in multivariate time series classification is a significant challenge due to data complexity and high dimensionality. This paper introduces PHeatPruner, a method integrating persistent homology and sheaf theory to address these challenges. Persistent homology facilitates the pruning of up to 45% of the applied variables while maintaining or enhancing the accuracy of models such as Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM, all without depending on posterior probabilities or supervised optimization algorithms. Concurrently, sheaf theory contributes explanatory vectors that provide deeper insights into the data's structural nuances. The approach was validated using the UEA Archive and a mastitis detection dataset for dairy cows. The results demonstrate that PHeatPruner effectively preserves model accuracy. Furthermore, our results highlight PHeatPruner's key features, i.e. simplifying complex data and offering actionable insights without increasing processing time or complexity. This method bridges the gap between complexity reduction and interpretability, suggesting promising applications in various fields.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Bridging the Gap: Introducing Joint Models for Longitudinal and Time-to-event Data in the Social Sciences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18288v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time-to-event analyses in social sciences, there often exist endogenous time-varying variables, where the event status is correlated with the trajectory of the covariate itself. Ignoring this endogeneity will result in biased estimates. In the field of biostatistics this issue is tackled by estimating a joint model for longitudinal and time-to-event data as it handles endogenous covariates properly. This method is underused in the social sciences even though it is very useful to model longitudinal and time-to-event processes appropriately. Therefore, this paper provides a gentle introduction to the method of joint models and highlights its advantages for social science research questions. We demonstrate its usage on an example on marital satisfaction and marriage dissolution and compare the results with classical approaches such as a time-to-event model with a time-varying covariate. In addition to demonstrating the method, our results contribute to the understanding of the relationship between marriage satisfaction, marriage dissolution and other covariates.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, data-driven models based on machine learning and big data analysis have emerged for calculation purposes, leveraging the information available in large datasets obtained from smart meters and other advanced measurement infrastructure. However, existing data-driven algorithms do not take into account the quality of data collected from smart meters. They lack built-in anomaly detection mechanisms and fail to differentiate anomalies based on whether the value or context of anomalous data instances deviates from the norm. This paper focuses on methods for detecting and mitigating the impact of anomalies on the consumption of active and reactive power datasets. It proposes an anomaly detection framework based on the Isolation Forest machine learning algorithm and Fast Fourier Transform filtering that works in both the time and frequency domain and is unaffected by point anomalies or contextual anomalies of the power consumption data. The importance of integrating anomaly detection methods is demonstrated in the analysis important for distribution networks with a high share of smart meters.</p></details> |  |

In the case of homogeneous media, it has been observed that the iterative solution of the linear system can be accelerated by hybridizing with transmission variables instead of numerical traces, as performed in standard approaches. In this work, we extend the HDG method with transmission variables, which is called the CHDG method, to the heterogeneous case with piecewise constant physical coefficients. In particular, we consider formulations with standard upwind and general symmetric fluxes. The CHDG hybridized system can be written as a fixed-point problem, which can be solved with stationary iterative schemes for a class of symmetric fluxes. The standard HDG and CHDG methods are systematically studied with the different numerical fluxes by considering a series of 2D numerical benchmarks. The convergence of standard iterative schemes is always faster with the extended CHDG method than with the standard HDG methods, with upwind and scalar symmetric fluxes.</p></details> |  |

We focus on three core aspects that contribute to Bitcoin's time discontinuity: the random and distributed block generation process, the occurrence of forks and rollbacks that disrupt the linear progression of the blockchain, and the nature of transactions within this system, which are subject to potential reordering or invalidation. These elements combine to create a time structure in Bitcoin that is fundamentally different from the continuous, linear time systems typically seen in traditional computing and physics.</p></details> |  |

We evaluated LSTM and GRU networks because of their performance reported in related work. We describe our method and its results on two datasets. The first dataset is the S&P BSE BANKEX, composed of stock time series (closing prices) of ten financial institutions. The second dataset, called Activities, comprises ten synthetic time series resembling weekly activities with five days of high activity and two days of low activity. We report Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between actual and predicted values, as well as Directional Accuracy (DA). We show that a single time series from a dataset can be used to adequately train the networks if the sequences in the dataset contain patterns that repeat, even with certain variation, and are properly processed. For 1-step ahead and 20-step ahead forecasts, LSTM and GRU networks significantly outperform a baseline on the Activities dataset. The baseline simply repeats the last available value. On the stock market dataset, the networks perform just like the baseline, possibly due to the nature of these series. We release the datasets used as well as the implementation with all experiments performed to enable future comparisons and to make our research reproducible.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Tree Boosting Methods for Balanced andImbalanced Classification and their Robustness Over Time in Risk Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18133v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most real-world classification problems deal with imbalanced datasets, posing a challenge for Artificial Intelligence (AI), i.e., machine learning algorithms, because the minority class, which is of extreme interest, often proves difficult to be detected. This paper empirically evaluates tree boosting methods' performance given different dataset sizes and class distributions, from perfectly balanced to highly imbalanced. For tabular data, tree-based methods such as XGBoost, stand out in several benchmarks due to detection performance and speed. Therefore, XGBoost and Imbalance-XGBoost are evaluated. After introducing the motivation to address risk assessment with machine learning, the paper reviews evaluation metrics for detection systems or binary classifiers. It proposes a method for data preparation followed by tree boosting methods including hyper-parameter optimization. The method is evaluated on private datasets of 1 thousand (K), 10K and 100K samples on distributions with 50, 45, 25, and 5 percent positive samples. As expected, the developed method increases its recognition performance as more data is given for training and the F1 score decreases as the data distribution becomes more imbalanced, but it is still significantly superior to the baseline of precision-recall determined by the ratio of positives divided by positives and negatives. Sampling to balance the training set does not provide consistent improvement and deteriorates detection. In contrast, classifier hyper-parameter optimization improves recognition, but should be applied carefully depending on data volume and distribution. Finally, the developed method is robust to data variation over time up to some point. Retraining can be used when performance starts deteriorating.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.15218</p></details> |

This paper revisits collision avoidance between ellipsoidal objects using differentiable constraints. Two ellipsoids do not overlap if and only if the endpoint of the vector between the center points of the ellipsoids does not lie in the interior of the Minkowski sum of the ellipsoids. This condition is formulated using a parametric over-approximation of the Minkowski sum, which can be made tight in any given direction. The resulting collision avoidance constraint is included in an optimal control problem (OCP) and evaluated in comparison to the separating-hyperplane approach. Not only do we observe that the Minkowski-sum formulation is computationally more efficient in our experiments, but also that using pre-determined over-approximation parameters based on warm-start trajectories leads to a very limited increase in suboptimality. This gives rise to a novel real-time scheme for collision-free motion planning with model predictive control (MPC). Both the real-time feasibility and the effectiveness of the constraint formulation are demonstrated in challenging real-world experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version corrects a typographical error in the proof of Lemma 3.

Some measures for evaluating the degree of departure from the MH model have been proposed. This study proposes a new directional measure using the discrete-time hazard, assuming that categories represent discrete time points. The proposed measure is capable of capturing both the magnitude and direction of deviation from the MH model. It is defined on a continuous scale from $-1$ to $1$, which allows for intuitive interpretation of the nature of marginal change. An estimator of the proposed measure and an asymptotic confidence interval are derived using the delta method. The theoretical properties of the measure are also discussed. The proposed measure provides a flexible tool for characterizing marginal inhomogeneity in square contingency tables under ordinal settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adaptive Grasping Force Tracking Strategy for Nonlinear and Time-Varying Object Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02335v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate grasp force control is one of the key skills for ensuring successful and damage-free robotic grasping of objects. Although existing methods have conducted in-depth research on slip detection and grasping force planning, they often overlook the issue of adaptive tracking of the actual force to the target force when handling objects with different material properties. The optimal parameters of a force tracking controller are significantly influenced by the object's stiffness, and many adaptive force tracking algorithms rely on stiffness estimation. However, real-world objects often exhibit viscous, plastic, or other more complex nonlinear time-varying behaviors, and existing studies provide insufficient support for these materials in terms of stiffness definition and estimation. To address this, this paper introduces the concept of generalized stiffness, extending the definition of stiffness to nonlinear time-varying grasp system models, and proposes an online generalized stiffness estimator based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Based on generalized stiffness, this paper proposes an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy using a PI controller as an example, enabling dynamic force tracking for objects with varying characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high precision and short probing time, while showing better adaptability to non-ideal objects compared to existing methods. The method effectively solves the problem of grasp force tracking in unknown, nonlinear, and time-varying grasp systems, demonstrating the generalization capability of our neural network and enhancing the robotic grasping ability in unstructured environments.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel method at the intersection of artificial intelligence and medicine, aiming to develop machine learning models with direct real-world applications in surgical contexts. We propose a multi-modal framework that leverages recent advancements in computer vision and large language models to generate comprehensive video summaries. % The approach is structured in three key stages. First, surgical videos are divided into clips, and visual features are extracted at the frame level using visual transformers. This step focuses on detecting tools, tissues, organs, and surgical actions. Second, the extracted features are transformed into frame-level captions via large language models. These are then combined with temporal features, captured using a ViViT-based encoder, to produce clip-level summaries that reflect the broader context of each video segment. Finally, the clip-level descriptions are aggregated into a full surgical report using a dedicated LLM tailored for the summarization task. % We evaluate our method on the CholecT50 dataset, using instrument and action annotations from 50 laparoscopic videos. The results show strong performance, achieving 96\% precision in tool detection and a BERT score of 0.74 for temporal context summarization. This work contributes to the advancement of AI-assisted tools for surgical reporting, offering a step toward more intelligent and reliable clinical documentation.</p></details> |  |

Signal Temporal Logic (STL) provides a formal framework for specifying such objectives, with robustness metrics widely employed for control synthesis. Existing optimization-based approaches using neural network (NN)-based controllers often rely on a single NN for both learning and control. However, variations in initial states and obstacle configurations can lead to discontinuous changes in the optimization solution, thereby degrading generalization and control performance. To address this issue, this study proposes a method to enhance recurrent neural network (RNN)-based control by clustering solution trajectories that satisfy STL specifications under diverse initial conditions. The proposed approach utilizes trajectory similarity metrics to generate clustering labels, which are subsequently used to train a classification network. This network assigns new initial states and obstacle configurations to the appropriate cluster, enabling the selection of a specialized controller. By explicitly accounting for variations in solution trajectories, the proposed method improves both estimation accuracy and control performance. Numerical experiments on a dynamic vehicle path planning problem demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted for publication</p></details> |

Recognizing the sparsity and complexity of 3D space, previous vision-centric methods have employed implicit learning-based approaches to model spatial and temporal information. However, these approaches struggle to capture local details and diminish the model's spatial discriminative ability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel explicit state-based modeling method designed to leverage the occupied state to renovate the 3D features. Specifically, we propose a sparse occlusion-aware attention mechanism, integrated with a cascade refinement strategy, which accurately renovates 3D features with the guidance of occupied state information. Additionally, we introduce a novel method for modeling long-term dynamic interactions, which reduces computational costs and preserves spatial information. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods, our efficient explicit renovation strategy not only delivers superior performance in terms of RayIoU and mAVE for occupancy and scene flow prediction but also markedly reduces GPU memory usage during training, bringing it down to 8.7GB.

It examines whether LMs can correctly associate a temporal context with a past fact valid over a defined period, by asking them to differentiate correct from incorrect contexts. The accuracy of LMs is analyzed along two dimensions: the distance of the incorrect context from the validity period and the granularity of the context. To this end, a dataset called TimeStress is introduced, enabling the evaluation of 18 diverse LMs. Results reveal that the best LM achieves perfect accuracy for only 6% of the studied facts, with critical errors that humans would not make. This work highlights the limitations of current LMs in temporal representation. We provide all data and code for further research.</p></details> | preprint v4 |

However, the motifs previously considered are either limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles, which are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of social systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these triangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be mined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the edge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods motifs of the literature. We also confirm in empirical data that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to the Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show how mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for spatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that network. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the edge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions. In the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the edge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network they were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development, that we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bullet: Boosting GPU Utilization for LLM Serving via Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Orchestration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19516v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern LLM serving systems confront inefficient GPU utilization due to the fundamental mismatch between compute-intensive prefill and memory-bound decode phases. While current practices attempt to address this by organizing these phases into hybrid batches, such solutions create an inefficient tradeoff that sacrifices either throughput or latency, leaving substantial GPU resources underutilized. We identify two key root causes: 1) the prefill phase suffers from suboptimal compute utilization due to wave quantization and attention bottlenecks. 2) hybrid batches disproportionately prioritize latency over throughput, resulting in wasted compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate the issues, we present Bullet, a novel spatial-temporal orchestration system that eliminates these inefficiencies through precise phase coordination. Bullet enables concurrent execution of prefill and decode phases, while dynamically provisioning GPU resources using real-time performance modeling. By integrating SLO-aware scheduling and adaptive resource allocation, Bullet maximizes utilization without compromising latency targets. Experimental evaluations on real-world workloads demonstrate that Bullet delivers 1.26x average throughput gains (up to 1.55x) over state-of-the-arts, while consistently meeting latency constraints.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel method to learn temporal logic predicates from data with finite-sample correctness guarantees. Our approach leverages expression optimization and conformal prediction to learn predicates that correctly describe future trajectories under mild statistical assumptions.

The proposed framework is data-driven and abstraction-based: leveraging observations of the system, our approach learns a high-confidence abstraction of the system in the form of an uncertain Markov decision process (UMDP). The uncertainty in the resulting UMDP is used to formally account for both the error in abstracting the system and for the uncertainty coming from the data. Critically, we show that for any given state-action pair in the resulting UMDP, the uncertainty in the transition probabilities can be represented as a convex polytope obtained by a two-layer state discretization and concentration inequalities. This allows us to obtain tighter uncertainty estimates compared to existing approaches, and guarantees efficiency, as we tailor a synthesis algorithm exploiting the structure of this UMDP. We empirically validate our approach on several case studies, showing substantially improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse VideoGen: Accelerating Video Diffusion Transformers with Spatial-Temporal Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01776v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) dominate video generation but their high computational cost severely limits real-world applicability, usually requiring tens of minutes to generate a few seconds of video even on high-performance GPUs. This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational complexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that leverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference efficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified into two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where only spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output, and (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different frames dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling strategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of attention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout transformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x and 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively, while preserving generation quality.

This kernel scheme reduces the number of parameters with respect to a fully connected neural network (NN). While CNN has proven to be an effective model in recognition of handwritten characters and traffic signal sign boards, etc. recently, its deep variants have proven to be effective in similar as well as more challenging applications like object, scene and action recognition. Deep CNN add more layers and kernels to the classical CNN, increasing the number of parameters, and partly reducing the main advantage of CNN which is less parameters. In this paper, a 3D pyramidal neural network called 3DPyraNet and a discriminative approach for spatio-temporal feature learning based on it, called 3DPyraNet-F, are proposed. 3DPyraNet introduces a new weighting scheme which learns features from both spatial and temporal dimensions analyzing multiple adjacent frames and keeping a biological plausible structure. It keeps the spatial topology of the input image and presents fewer parameters and lower computational and memory costs compared to both fully connected NNs and recent deep CNNs. 3DPyraNet-F extract the features maps of the highest layer of the learned network, fuse them in a single vector, and provide it as input in such a way to a linear-SVM classifier that enhances the recognition of human actions and dynamic scenes from the videos. Encouraging results are reported with 3DPyraNet in real-world environments, especially in the presence of camera induced motion. Further, 3DPyraNet-F clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art on three benchmark datasets and shows comparable result for the fourth.</p></details> |  |

However, these techniques are less generalized in large-scale or complex scenarios, especially in satellite videos. In this paper, we propose to exploit the well-defined temporal difference for efficient and effective temporal compensation. To fully utilize the local and global temporal information within frames, we systematically modeled the short-term and long-term temporal discrepancies since we observed that these discrepancies offer distinct and mutually complementary properties. Specifically, we devise a Short-term Temporal Difference Module (S-TDM) to extract local motion representations from RGB difference maps between adjacent frames, which yields more clues for accurate texture representation. To explore the global dependency in the entire frame sequence, a Long-term Temporal Difference Module (L-TDM) is proposed, where the differences between forward and backward segments are incorporated and activated to guide the modulation of the temporal feature, leading to a holistic global compensation. Moreover, we further propose a Difference Compensation Unit (DCU) to enrich the interaction between the spatial distribution of the target frame and temporal compensated results, which helps maintain spatial consistency while refining the features to avoid misalignment. Rigorous objective and subjective evaluations conducted across five mainstream video satellites demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches.

Existing TAMP approaches often struggle to scale effectively for multi-robot systems with complex specifications, leading to infeasible solutions and prolonged computation times. This work addresses the TAMP problem in multi-robot settings where tasks are specified using expressive hierarchical temporal logic and task assignments are not pre-determined. Our approach leverages the efficiency of hierarchical temporal logic specifications for task-level planning and the optimization-based graph of convex sets method for motion-level planning, integrating them within a product graph framework. At the task level, we convert hierarchical temporal logic specifications into a single graph, embedding task allocation within its edges. At the motion level, we represent the feasible motions of multiple robots through convex sets in the configuration space, guided by a sampling-based motion planner. This formulation allows us to define the TAMP problem as a shortest path search within the product graph, where efficient convex optimization techniques can be applied. We prove that our approach is both sound and complete under mild assumptions. Additionally, we extend our framework to cooperative pick-and-place tasks involving object handovers between robots. We evaluate our method across various high-dimensional multi-robot scenarios, including simulated and real-world environments with quadrupeds, robotic arms, and automated conveyor systems. Our results show that our approach outperforms existing methods in execution time and solution optimality while effectively scaling with task complexity.</p></details> |  |

The architecture is structured around CNN-based representation layers, each dedicated to an independent representation learning task and designed to capture diverse temporal patterns, followed by an attention-based feature extraction layer and a merge layer, designed to aggregate extracted features. The architecture is fundamentally based on a configuration that is inspired by a Transformer encoder, with self-attention mechanisms at its core. The TSRM architecture outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on most of the seven established benchmark datasets considered in our empirical evaluation for both forecasting and imputation tasks. At the same time, it significantly reduces complexity in the form of learnable parameters. The source code is available at https://github.com/RobertLeppich/TSRM.</p></details> |  |
| **[M2R2: MulitModal Robotic Representation for Temporal Action Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18662v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal action segmentation (TAS) has long been a key area of research in both robotics and computer vision. In robotics, algorithms have primarily focused on leveraging proprioceptive information to determine skill boundaries, with recent approaches in surgical robotics incorporating vision. In contrast, computer vision typically relies on exteroceptive sensors, such as cameras. Existing multimodal TAS models in robotics integrate feature fusion within the model, making it difficult to reuse learned features across different models. Meanwhile, pretrained vision-only feature extractors commonly used in computer vision struggle in scenarios with limited object visibility. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing M2R2, a multimodal feature extractor tailored for TAS, which combines information from both proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors. We introduce a novel pretraining strategy that enables the reuse of learned features across multiple TAS models. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the REASSEMBLE dataset, a challenging multimodal robotic assembly dataset, outperforming existing robotic action segmentation models by 46.6%. Additionally, we conduct an extensive ablation study to evaluate the contribution of different modalities in robotic TAS tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

While T2-weighted (T2w) MRI with high in-plane resolution is widely used to segment hippocampal subfields due to its higher contrast in hippocampus, its lower out-of-plane resolution reduces the accuracy of subregion thickness measurements. To address this issue, we developed a nearly isotropic segmentation pipeline that incorporates image and label upsampling and high-resolution segmentation in T2w MRI. First, a high-resolution atlas was created based on an existing anisotropic atlas derived from 29 individuals. Both T1-weighted and T2w images in the atlas were upsampled from their original resolution to a nearly isotropic resolution 0.4x0.4x0.52mm3 using a non-local means approach. Manual segmentations within the atlas were also upsampled to match this resolution using a UNet-based neural network, which was trained on a cohort consisting of both high-resolution ex vivo and low-resolution anisotropic in vivo MRI with manual segmentations. Second, a multi-modality deep learning-based segmentation model was trained within this nearly isotropic atlas. Finally, experiments showed the nearly isotropic subregion segmentation improved the accuracy of cortical thickness as an imaging biomarker for neurodegeneration in T2w MRI.</p></details> |  |

While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Reupl...</summary><p>Reuploaded with new version-- equation 16 was incorrect</p></details> |

However, existing methods often fail to incorporate adequate spatio-temporal modeling and prompt alignment within a unified framework, resulting in temporal inconsistencies, geometric distortions, or low-quality 4D content that deviates from the provided texts. Therefore, we propose STP4D, a novel approach that aims to integrate comprehensive spatio-temporal-prompt consistency modeling for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Specifically, STP4D employs three carefully designed modules: Time-varying Prompt Embedding, Geometric Information Enhancement, and Temporal Extension Deformation, which collaborate to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, STP4D is among the first methods to exploit the Diffusion model to generate 4D Gaussians, combining the fine-grained modeling capabilities and the real-time rendering process of 4DGS with the rapid inference speed of the Diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STP4D excels in generating high-fidelity 4D content with exceptional efficiency (approximately 4.6s per asset), surpassing existing methods in both quality and speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Entailment Pretraining for Clinical Language Models over EHR Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18128v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical language models have achieved strong performance on downstream tasks by pretraining on domain specific corpora such as discharge summaries and medical notes. However, most approaches treat the electronic health record as a static document, neglecting the temporally-evolving and causally entwined nature of patient trajectories. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal entailment pretraining objective for language models in the clinical domain. Our method formulates EHR segments as temporally ordered sentence pairs and trains the model to determine whether a later state is entailed by, contradictory to, or neutral with respect to an earlier state. Through this temporally structured pretraining task, models learn to perform latent clinical reasoning over time, improving their ability to generalize across forecasting and diagnosis tasks. We pretrain on a large corpus derived from MIMIC IV and demonstrate state of the art results on temporal clinical QA, early warning prediction, and disease progression modeling.</p></details> |  |

Multi-sensor synchronous measurement has proven to be more effective for WHAR than using a single sensor. However, existing WHAR methods use shared convolutional kernels for indiscriminate temporal feature extraction across each sensor variable, which fails to effectively capture spatio-temporal relationships of intra-sensor and inter-sensor variables. We propose the DecomposeWHAR model consisting of a decomposition phase and a fusion phase to better model the relationships between modality variables. The decomposition creates high-dimensional representations of each intra-sensor variable through the improved Depth Separable Convolution to capture local temporal features while preserving their unique characteristics. The fusion phase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and fusing their features at both the channel and variable levels. Long-range temporal dependencies are modeled using the State Space Model (SSM), and later cross-sensor interactions are dynamically captured through a self-attention mechanism, highlighting inter-sensor spatial correlations. Our model demonstrates superior performance on three widely used WHAR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[PTCL: Pseudo-Label Temporal Curriculum Learning for Label-Limited Dynamic Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17641v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic node classification is critical for modeling evolving systems like financial transactions and academic collaborations. In such systems, dynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node classification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp. However, it is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to high annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels in fraud detection). In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain as they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a unique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history data. To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum Learning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node classification where only final labels are available. PTCL introduces: (1) a temporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware representations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which generate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that prioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them higher weights using an exponentially decaying function. We contribute a new academic dataset (CoOAG), capturing long-range research interest in dynamic graph. Experiments across real-world scenarios demonstrate PTCL's consistent superiority over other methods adapted to this task. Beyond methodology, we propose a unified framework FLiD (Framework for Label-Limited Dynamic Node Classification), consisting of a complete preparation workflow, training pipeline, and evaluation standards, and supporting various models and datasets.

Existing deep learning models often lack spatial generalizability, rely on complex architectures, and struggle with real-time deployment. To address these limitations, we propose the Temporal Graph-based Digital Twin (TGDT), a scalable framework that integrates Temporal Convolutional Networks and Attentional Graph Neural Networks for dynamic, direction-aware traffic modeling and assessment at urban corridors. TGDT estimates key Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) for traffic flow optimization at both the intersection level (e.g., queue length, waiting time) and the corridor level (e.g., traffic volume, travel time). Its modular architecture and sequential optimization scheme enable easy extension to any number of intersections and MOEs. The model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by accurately producing high-dimensional, concurrent multi-output estimates. It also demonstrates high robustness and accuracy across diverse traffic conditions, including extreme scenarios, while relying on only a minimal set of traffic features. Fully parallelized, TGDT can simulate over a thousand scenarios within a matter of seconds, offering a cost-effective, interpretable, and real-time solution for traffic signal optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

A crucial yet underexplored aspect in the development of these systems is the creation of computer vision models capable of autonomously segmenting full-procedure colonoscopy videos into anatomical sections and procedural phases. In this work, we aim to create the first open-access dataset for this task and propose a state-of-the-art approach, benchmarked against competitive models. We annotated the publicly available REAL-Colon dataset, consisting of 2.7 million frames from 60 complete colonoscopy videos, with frame-level labels for anatomical locations and colonoscopy phases across nine categories. We then present ColonTCN, a learning-based architecture that employs custom temporal convolutional blocks designed to efficiently capture long temporal dependencies for the temporal segmentation of colonoscopy videos. We also propose a dual k-fold cross-validation evaluation protocol for this benchmark, which includes model assessment on unseen, multi-center data.ColonTCN achieves state-of-the-art performance in classification accuracy while maintaining a low parameter count when evaluated using the two proposed k-fold cross-validation settings, outperforming competitive models. We report ablation studies to provide insights into the challenges of this task and highlight the benefits of the custom temporal convolutional blocks, which enhance learning and improve model efficiency. We believe that the proposed open-access benchmark and the ColonTCN approach represent a significant advancement in the temporal segmentation of colonoscopy procedures, fostering further open-access research to address this clinical need.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Framework for Real-Time Data Drift and Anomaly Identification Using Hierarchical Temporal Memory and Statistical Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18599v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data Drift is the phenomenon where the generating model behind the data changes over time. Due to data drift, any model built on the past training data becomes less relevant and inaccurate over time. Thus, detecting and controlling for data drift is critical in machine learning models. Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a machine learning model developed by Jeff Hawkins, inspired by how the human brain processes information. It is a biologically inspired model of memory that is similar in structure to the neocortex, and whose performance is claimed to be comparable to state of the art models in detecting anomalies in time series data. Another unique benefit of HTMs is its independence from training and testing cycle; all the learning takes place online with streaming data and no separate training and testing cycle is required. In sequential learning paradigm, Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) offers some unique benefit for online learning and inference. This paper proposes a novel hybrid framework combining HTM and SPRT for real-time data drift detection and anomaly identification. Unlike existing data drift methods, our approach eliminates frequent retraining and ensures low false positive rates. HTMs currently work with one dimensional or univariate data. In a second study, we also propose an application of HTM in multidimensional supervised scenario for anomaly detection by combining the outputs of multiple HTM columns, one for each dimension of the data, through a neural network. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional drift detection techniques like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, Wasserstein distance, and Population Stability Index (PSI) in terms of accuracy, adaptability, and computational efficiency. Our experiments also provide insights into optimizing hyperparameters for real-time deployment in domains such as Telecom.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |

In this article, we relax this problem and ask whether a given degree sequence can be realized as a temporally connected graph. Our main results are a complete characterization of the feasible cases, and a recognition algorithm that runs in $O(n)$ time for graphical degree sequences (realized as simple temporal graphs) and in $O(n+m)$ time for multigraphical degree sequences (realized as non-simple temporal graphs, where the number of time labels on an edge corresponds to the multiplicity of the edge in the multigraph). In fact, these algorithms can be made constructive at essentially no cost. Namely, we give a constructive $O(n+m)$ time algorithm that outputs, for a given (multi)graphical degree sequence $\mathbf{d}$, a temporally connected graph whose underlying (multi)graph is a realization of $\mathbf{d}$, if one exists.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Generation of Safety-compliant Linear Temporal Logic via Large Language Model: A Self-supervised Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15840v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Converting high-level tasks described by natural language into formal specifications like Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is a key step towards providing formal safety guarantees over cyber-physical systems (CPS). While the compliance of the formal specifications themselves against the safety restrictions imposed on CPS is crucial for ensuring safety, most existing works only focus on translation consistency between natural languages and formal specifications. In this paper, we introduce AutoSafeLTL, a self-supervised framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of LTL specifications complying with a set of safety restrictions while preserving their logical consistency and semantic accuracy. As a key insight, our framework integrates Language Inclusion check with an automated counterexample-guided modification mechanism to ensure the safety-compliance of the resulting LTL specifications. In particular, we develop 1) an LLM-as-an-Aligner, which performs atomic proposition matching between generated LTL specifications and safety restrictions to enforce semantic alignment; and 2) an LLM-as-a-Critic, which automates LTL specification refinement by interpreting counterexamples derived from Language Inclusion checks. Experimental results demonstrate that our architecture effectively guarantees safety-compliance for the generated LTL specifications, achieving a 0% violation rate against imposed safety restrictions. This shows the potential of our work in synergizing AI and formal verification techniques, enhancing safety-aware specification generation and automatic verification for both AI and critical CPS applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 3D segmentation models solely focus on spatial information. To address this gap, we propose OmniMamba4D, a novel segmentation model designed for 4D medical images (3D images over time). OmniMamba4D utilizes a spatio-temporal tetra-orientated Mamba block to effectively capture both spatial and temporal features. Unlike traditional 3D models, which analyze single-time points, OmniMamba4D processes 4D CT data, providing comprehensive spatio-temporal information on lesion progression. Evaluated on an internal dataset comprising of 3,252 CT scans, OmniMamba4D achieves a competitive Dice score of 0.682, comparable to state-of-the-arts (SOTA) models, while maintaining computational efficiency and better detecting disappeared lesions. This work demonstrates a new framework to leverage spatio-temporal information for longitudinal CT lesion segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2025</p></details> |

Traffic speed data is often incomplete due to sensor failures, data transmission delays, or occlusions, resulting in missing speed data in certain road segments. Currently, tensor decomposition based methods are extensively utilized, they mostly rely on the $L_2$-norm to construct their learning objectives, which leads to reduced robustness in the algorithms. To address this, we propose Temporal-Aware Traffic Speed Imputation (TATSI), which combines the $L_2$-norm and smooth $L_1$ (${SL}_1$)-norm in its loss function, thereby achieving both high accuracy and robust performance in imputing missing time-varying traffic speed data. TATSI adopts a single latent factor-dependent, nonnegative, and multiplicative update (SLF-NMU) approach, which serves as an efficient solver for performing nonnegative latent factor analysis (LFA) on a tensor. Empirical studies on three real-world time-varying traffic speed datasets demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art traffic speed predictors, TATSI more precisely captures temporal patterns, thereby yielding the most accurate imputations for missing traffic speed data.</p></details> | 11pages,3figures |

However, EEG signals are often noisy, affected by artifacts, and vary across individuals, complicating emotion recognition. While multimodal approaches have used Peripheral Physiological Signals (PPS) like GSR to complement EEG, they often overlook the dynamic synchronization and consistent semantics between the modalities. Additionally, the temporal dynamics of emotional fluctuations across different time resolutions in PPS remain underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose PhysioSync, a novel pre-training framework leveraging temporal and cross-modal contrastive learning, inspired by physiological synchronization phenomena. PhysioSync incorporates Cross-Modal Consistency Alignment (CM-CA) to model dynamic relationships between EEG and complementary PPS, enabling emotion-related synchronizations across modalities. Besides, it introduces Long- and Short-Term Temporal Contrastive Learning (LS-TCL) to capture emotional synchronization at different temporal resolutions within modalities. After pre-training, cross-resolution and cross-modal features are hierarchically fused and fine-tuned to enhance emotion recognition. Experiments on DEAP and DREAMER datasets demonstrate PhysioSync's advanced performance under uni-modal and cross-modal conditions, highlighting its effectiveness for EEG-centered emotion recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/MSA-LMC/PhysioSync</p></details> |

Our approach significantly reduces both training and inference time while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that our method achieves results on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models across several evaluation metrics. These results underscore the effectiveness of our model in enabling efficient and scalable temporal set prediction.</p></details> |  |

In many real-world applications, modeling both the internal structure of sets and their temporal relationships across time is essential for capturing complex underlying patterns. However, existing methods either focus on learning set representations at a static level, ignoring temporal dynamics, or treat sequences as ordered lists of individual elements, lacking explicit mechanisms to represent sets. In this work, we propose Set2Seq Transformer, a novel architecture that jointly models permutation-invariant set structure and temporal dependencies by learning temporal and positional-aware representations of sets within a sequence in an end-to-end multimodal manner. We evaluate our Set2Seq Transformer on two tasks that require modeling both set structure alongside temporal and positional patterns, but differ significantly in domain, modality, and objective. First, we consider a fine-art analysis task, modeling artists' oeuvres for predicting artistic success using a novel dataset, WikiArt-Seq2Rank. Second, we utilize our Set2Seq Transformer for a short-term wildfire danger forecasting task. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our Set2Seq Transformer significantly improves over traditional static multiple-instance learning methods by effectively learning permutation-invariant set, temporal, and positional-aware representations across diverse domains, modalities, and tasks. We will release both the dataset and model implementations on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximating Optimal Labelings for Temporal Connectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16837v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a temporal graph the edge set dynamically changes over time according to a set of time-labels associated with each edge that indicates at which time-steps the edge is available. Two vertices are connected if there is a path connecting them in which the edges are traversed in increasing order of their labels. We study the problem of scheduling the availability time of the edges of a temporal graph in such a way that all pairs of vertices are connected within a given maximum allowed time $a$ and the overall number of labels is minimized. The problem, known as \emph{Minimum Aged Labeling} (MAL), has several applications in logistics, distribution scheduling, and information spreading in social networks, where carefully choosing the time-labels can significantly reduce infrastructure costs, fuel consumption, or greenhouse gases. The problem MAL has previously been proved to be NP-complete on undirected graphs and \APX-hard on directed graphs. In this paper, we extend our knowledge on the complexity and approximability of MAL in several directions. We first show that the problem cannot be approximated within a factor better than $O(\log n)$ when $a\geq 2$, unless $\text{P} = \text{NP}$, and a factor better than $2^{\log ^{1-\epsilon} n}$ when $a\geq 3$, unless $\text{NP}\subseteq \text{DTIME}(2^{\text{polylog}(n)})$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph. Then we give a set of approximation algorithms that, under some conditions, almost match these lower bounds. In particular, we show that the approximation depends on a relation between $a$ and the diameter of the input graph. We further establish a connection with a foundational optimization problem on static graphs called \emph{Diameter Constrained Spanning Subgraph} (DCSS) and show that our hardness results also apply to DCSS.</p></details> |  |

The former, while describing SST evolution through differential equations, suffers from high computational complexity and limited applicability, whereas the latter, despite its computational benefits, requires large datasets and faces interpretability challenges. This study presents a prediction framework based solely on data-driven techniques. Using phase space reconstruction, we construct initial-delay attractor pairs with a mathematical homeomorphism and design a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Mapping (STFM) to uncover their intrinsic connections.

However, its effectiveness in video recognition tasks is hampered by two main challenges. First, fast adversarial training for video models remains largely unexplored, which severely impedes its practical applications. Specifically, most video adversarial training methods are computationally costly, with long training times and high expenses. Second, existing methods struggle with the trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. To address these challenges, we introduce Video Fast Adversarial Training with Weak-to-Strong consistency (VFAT-WS), the first fast adversarial training method for video data. Specifically, VFAT-WS incorporates the following key designs: First, it integrates a straightforward yet effective temporal frequency augmentation (TF-AUG), and its spatial-temporal enhanced form STF-AUG, along with a single-step PGD attack to boost training efficiency and robustness. Second, it devises a weak-to-strong spatial-temporal consistency regularization, which seamlessly integrates the simpler TF-AUG and the more complex STF-AUG. Leveraging the consistency regularization, it steers the learning process from simple to complex augmentations. Both of them work together to achieve a better trade-off between clean accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 with both CNN and Transformer-based models demonstrate that VFAT-WS achieves great improvements in adversarial robustness and corruption robustness, while accelerating training by nearly 490%.</p></details> | <details><summary>After...</summary><p>After the submission of the paper, we realized that the study still has room for expansion.

However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought (CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios.

However, the frame-independence of T2I generation often results in poor temporal consistency. Existing methods address this issue through temporal layer fine-tuning or inference-based temporal propagation, but these approaches suffer from high training costs or limited temporal coherence. To address these challenges, we propose a General and Efficient Adapter (GE-Adapter) that integrates temporal-spatial and semantic consistency with Baliteral DDIM inversion. This framework introduces three key components: (1) Frame-based Temporal Consistency Blocks (FTC Blocks) to capture frame-specific features and enforce smooth inter-frame transitions via temporally-aware loss functions; (2) Channel-dependent Spatial Consistency Blocks (SCD Blocks) employing bilateral filters to enhance spatial coherence by reducing noise and artifacts; and (3) Token-based Semantic Consistency Module (TSC Module) to maintain semantic alignment using shared prompt tokens and frame-specific tokens. Our method significantly improves perceptual quality, text-image alignment, and temporal coherence, as demonstrated on the MSR-VTT dataset. Additionally, it achieves enhanced fidelity and frame-to-frame coherence, offering a practical solution for T2V editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[LASER: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Learning Spatial-Temporal Scene Graphs with Weak Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07647v5)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised approaches for learning spatio-temporal scene graphs (STSG) from video are greatly hindered due to their reliance on STSG-annotated videos, which are labor-intensive to construct at scale. Is it feasible to instead use readily available video captions as weak supervision? To address this question, we propose LASER, a neuro-symbolic framework to enable training STSG generators using only video captions. LASER employs large language models to first extract logical specifications with rich spatio-temporal semantic information from video captions. LASER then trains the underlying STSG generator to align the predicted STSG with the specification. The alignment algorithm overcomes the challenges of weak supervision by leveraging a differentiable symbolic reasoner and using a combination of contrastive, temporal, and semantics losses. The overall approach efficiently trains low-level perception models to extract a fine-grained STSG that conforms to the video caption. In doing so, it enables a novel methodology for learning STSGs without tedious annotations. We evaluate our method on three video datasets: OpenPVSG, 20BN, and MUGEN. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over fully-supervised baselines, achieving a unary predicate prediction accuracy of 27.78% (+12.65%) and a binary recall@5 of 0.42 (+0.22) on OpenPVSG. Additionally, LASER exceeds baselines by 7% on 20BN and 5.2% on MUGEN in terms of overall predicate prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Temporal Consistency in Diffusion-Based Video Editing with Adaptor Modules: A Theoretical Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16016v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapter-based methods are commonly used to enhance model performance with minimal additional complexity, especially in video editing tasks that require frame-to-frame consistency. By inserting small, learnable modules into pretrained diffusion models, these adapters can maintain temporal coherence without extensive retraining. Approaches that incorporate prompt learning with both shared and frame-specific tokens are particularly effective in preserving continuity across frames at low training cost. In this work, we want to provide a general theoretical framework for adapters that maintain frame consistency in DDIM-based models under a temporal consistency loss. First, we prove that the temporal consistency objective is differentiable under bounded feature norms, and we establish a Lipschitz bound on its gradient. Second, we show that gradient descent on this objective decreases the loss monotonically and converges to a local minimum if the learning rate is within an appropriate range. Finally, we analyze the stability of modules in the DDIM inversion procedure, showing that the associated error remains controlled. These theoretical findings will reinforce the reliability of diffusion-based video editing methods that rely on adapter strategies and provide theoretical insights in video generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2501.04606</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Discovery of Motif Transition Process for Large-Scale Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15979v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the dynamic transition of motifs in temporal graphs is essential for revealing how graph structures evolve over time, identifying critical patterns, and predicting future behaviors, yet existing methods often focus on predefined motifs, limiting their ability to comprehensively capture transitions and interrelationships. We propose a parallel motif transition process discovery algorithm, PTMT, a novel parallel method for discovering motif transition processes in large-scale temporal graphs. PTMT integrates a tree-based framework with the temporal zone partitioning (TZP) strategy, which partitions temporal graphs by time and structure while preserving lossless motif transitions and enabling massive parallelism. PTMT comprises three phases: growth zone parallel expansion, overlap-aware result aggregation, and deterministic encoding of motif transitions, ensuring accurate tracking of dynamic transitions and interactions. Results on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that PTMT achieves speedups ranging from 12.0$\times$ to 50.3$\times$ compared to the SOTA method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convergent NMPC-based Reinforcement Learning Using Deep Expected Sarsa and Nonlinear Temporal Difference Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04925v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a learning-based nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) using an original reinforcement learning (RL) method to learn the optimal weights of the NMPC scheme, for which two methods are proposed. Firstly, the controller is used as the current action-value function of a deep Expected Sarsa where the subsequent action-value function, usually obtained with a secondary NMPC, is approximated with a neural network (NN). With respect to existing methods, we add to the NN's input the current value of the NMPC's learned parameters so that the network is able to approximate the action-value function and stabilize the learning performance. Additionally, with the use of the NN, the real-time computational burden is approximately halved without affecting the closed-loop performance. Secondly, we combine gradient temporal difference methods with a parametrized NMPC as a function approximator of the Expected Sarsa RL method to overcome the potential parameters' divergence and instability issues when nonlinearities are present in the function approximation. The simulation results show that the proposed approach converges to a locally optimal solution without instability problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mission-driven Exploration for Accelerated Deep Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Logic Task Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17059v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of designing control policies for agents with unknown stochastic dynamics and control objectives specified using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Recent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have aimed to compute policies that maximize the satisfaction probability of LTL formulas, but they often suffer from slow learning performance. To address this, we introduce a novel Deep Q-learning algorithm that significantly improves learning speed. The enhanced sample efficiency stems from a mission-driven exploration strategy that prioritizes exploration towards directions likely to contribute to mission success. Identifying these directions relies on an automaton representation of the LTL task as well as a learned neural network that partially models the agent-environment interaction. We provide comparative experiments demonstrating the efficiency of our algorithm on robot navigation tasks in unseen environments.</p></details> |  |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional methods struggle with challenges such as data imbalance and feature redundancy in ship motion data, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose the Temporal-Graph Contrastive Clustering Sea State Estimator (TGC-SSE), a novel deep learning model that combines three key components: a time dimension factorization module to reduce data redundancy, a dynamic graph-like learning module to capture complex variable interactions, and a contrastive clustering loss function to effectively manage class imbalance. Our experiments demonstrate that TGC-SSE significantly outperforms existing methods across 14 public datasets, achieving the highest accuracy in 9 datasets, with a 20.79% improvement over EDI. Furthermore, in the field of sea state estimation, TGC-SSE surpasses five benchmark methods and seven deep learning models. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each module, demonstrating their respective roles in enhancing overall model performance. Overall, TGC-SSE not only improves the accuracy of sea state estimation but also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, providing reliable support for autonomous vessel operations.</p></details> | 13 pages,15 figures |

While recent approaches employ pseudo labels for training, three key challenges: generating high-quality pseudo labels, making full use of different priors, and optimizing training methods with noisy labels remain unresolved. Due to these perspectives, we propose PseudoFormer, a novel two-branch framework that bridges the gap between weakly and fully-supervised Temporal Action Localization (TAL). We first introduce RickerFusion, which maps all predicted action proposals to a global shared space to generate pseudo labels with better quality. Subsequently, we leverage both snippet-level and proposal-level labels with different priors from the weak branch to train the regression-based model in the full branch. Finally, the uncertainty mask and iterative refinement mechanism are applied for training with noisy pseudo labels. PseudoFormer achieves state-of-the-art WTAL results on the two commonly used benchmarks, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3. Besides, extensive ablation studies demonstrate the contribution of each component of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</p></details> |

Recently, the evolving dynamics of knowledge have attracted a growing interest in Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA), an emerging task to answer temporal questions. However, this field grapples with ambiguities in defining temporal questions and lacks a systematic categorization of existing methods for TKGQA. In response, this paper provides a thorough survey from two perspectives: the taxonomy of temporal questions and the methodological categorization for TKGQA. Specifically, we first establish a detailed taxonomy of temporal questions engaged in prior studies. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive review of TKGQA techniques of two categories: semantic parsing-based and TKG embedding-based. Building on this review, the paper outlines potential research directions aimed at advancing the field of TKGQA. This work aims to serve as a comprehensive reference for TKGQA and to stimulate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures.

While significant advances have been made in plant phenotyping technologies, comprehensive temporal analysis of root development remains challenging, with most existing solutions providing either limited throughput or restricted structural analysis capabilities. Here, we present ChronoRoot 2.0, an integrated open-source platform that combines affordable hardware with advanced artificial intelligence to enable sophisticated temporal plant phenotyping. The system introduces several major advances, offering an integral perspective of seedling development: (i) simultaneous multi-organ tracking of six distinct plant structures, (ii) quality control through real-time validation, (iii) comprehensive architectural measurements including novel gravitropic response parameters, and (iv) dual specialized user interfaces for both architectural analysis and high-throughput screening. We demonstrate the system's capabilities through three use cases for Arabidopsis thaliana: characterization of circadian growth patterns under different light conditions, detailed analysis of gravitropic responses in transgenic plants, and high-throughput screening of etiolation responses across multiple genotypes. ChronoRoot 2.0 maintains its predecessor's advantages of low cost and modularity while significantly expanding its capabilities, making sophisticated temporal phenotyping more accessible to the broader plant science community. The system's open-source nature, combined with extensive documentation and containerized deployment options, ensures reproducibility and enables community-driven development of new analytical capabilities.</p></details> |  |

We present the first comprehensive study investigating these models' temporal plasticity - their ability to progressively enhance performance through continual learning while maintaining existing capabilities. Through experiments on real-world datasets exhibiting distribution shifts, we evaluate both conventional deep learning models and foundation models using a novel continual learning framework. Our findings reveal that while traditional models struggle with performance deterioration during incremental fine-tuning, foundation models like Time-MoE and Chronos demonstrate sustained improvement in predictive accuracy. This suggests that optimizing foundation model fine-tuning strategies may be more valuable than developing domain-specific small models. Our research introduces new evaluation methodologies and insights for developing foundation time series models with robust continuous learning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

| **[Exploring Temporally-Aware Features for Point Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12218v2)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point tracking in videos is a fundamental task with applications in robotics, video editing, and more. While many vision tasks benefit from pre-trained feature backbones to improve generalizability, point tracking has primarily relied on simpler backbones trained from scratch on synthetic data, which may limit robustness in real-world scenarios. Additionally, point tracking requires temporal awareness to ensure coherence across frames, but using temporally-aware features is still underexplored. Most current methods often employ a two-stage process: an initial coarse prediction followed by a refinement stage to inject temporal information and correct errors from the coarse stage. These approach, however, is computationally expensive and potentially redundant if the feature backbone itself captures sufficient temporal information. In this work, we introduce Chrono, a feature backbone specifically designed for point tracking with built-in temporal awareness. Leveraging pre-trained representations from self-supervised learner DINOv2 and enhanced with a temporal adapter, Chrono effectively captures long-term temporal context, enabling precise prediction even without the refinement stage. Experimental results demonstrate that Chrono achieves state-of-the-art performance in a refiner-free setting on the TAP-Vid-DAVIS and TAP-Vid-Kinetics datasets, among common feature backbones used in point tracking as well as DINOv2, with exceptional efficiency.

However, the low resolution of TIR images, along with tracking interference, significantly limits the perfor-mance of TIR trackers. To address these challenges, we introduce STARS, a novel sparse learning-based CF tracker that incorporates spatio-temporal regulari-zation and super-resolution reconstruction. First, we apply adaptive sparse filter-ing and temporal domain filtering to extract key features of the target while reduc-ing interference from background clutter and noise. Next, we introduce an edge-preserving sparse regularization method to stabilize target features and prevent excessive blurring. This regularization integrates multiple terms and employs the alternating direction method of multipliers to optimize the solution. Finally, we propose a gradient-enhanced super-resolution method to extract fine-grained TIR target features and improve the resolution of TIR images, addressing performance degradation in tracking caused by low-resolution sequences. To the best of our knowledge, STARS is the first to integrate super-resolution methods within a sparse learning-based CF framework. Extensive experiments on the LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR2017 benchmarks demonstrate that STARS outperforms state-of-the-art trackers in terms of robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Realizing temporal transportation trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18513v3)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the complexity of the periodic temporal graph realization problem with respect to upper bounds on the fastest path durations among its vertices. This constraint with respect to upper bounds appears naturally in transportation network design applications where, for example, a road network is given, and the goal is to appropriately schedule periodic travel routes, while not exceeding some desired upper bounds on the travel times. In our work, we focus only on underlying tree topologies, which are fundamental in many transportation network applications. As it turns out, the periodic upper-bounded temporal tree realization problem (TTR) has a very different computational complexity behavior than both (i) the classic graph realization problem with respect to shortest path distances in static graphs and (ii) the periodic temporal graph realization problem with exact given fastest travel times (which was recently introduced). First, we prove that, surprisingly, TTR is NP-hard, even for a constant period $\Delta$ and when the input tree $G$ satisfies at least one of the following conditions: (a) $G$ is a star, or (b) $G$ has constant maximum degree. Second, we prove that TTR is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to the number of leaves in the input tree $G$, via a novel combination of techniques for totally unimodular matrices and mixed integer linear programming.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Hybrid-Rule Temporal Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11344v2)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) are widely used for modeling event sequences in various medical domains, such as disease onset prediction, progression analysis, and clinical decision support. Although TPPs effectively capture temporal dynamics, their lack of interpretability remains a critical challenge. Recent advancements have introduced interpretable TPPs. However, these methods fail to incorporate numerical features, thereby limiting their ability to generate precise predictions. To address this issue, we propose Hybrid-Rule Temporal Point Processes (HRTPP), a novel framework that integrates temporal logic rules with numerical features, improving both interpretability and predictive accuracy in event modeling. HRTPP comprises three key components: basic intensity for intrinsic event likelihood, rule-based intensity for structured temporal dependencies, and numerical feature intensity for dynamic probability modulation. To effectively discover valid rules, we introduce a two-phase rule mining strategy with Bayesian optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a multi-criteria assessment framework, incorporating rule validity, model fitting, and temporal predictive accuracy. Experimental results on real-world medical datasets demonstrate that HRTPP outperforms state-of-the-art interpretable TPPs in terms of predictive performance and clinical interpretability. In case studies, the rules extracted by HRTPP explain the disease progression, offering valuable contributions to medical diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Graph Realization With Bounded Stretch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14258v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A periodic temporal graph, in its simplest form, is a graph in which every edge appears exactly once in the first $\Delta$ time steps, and then it reappears recurrently every $\Delta$ time steps, where $\Delta$ is a given period length. This model offers a natural abstraction of transportation networks where each transportation link connects two destinations periodically. From a network design perspective, a crucial task is to assign the time-labels on the edges in a way that optimizes some criterion. In this paper we introduce a very natural optimality criterion that captures how the temporal distances of all vertex pairs are `stretched', compared to their physical distances, i.e. their distances in the underlying static (non-temporal) graph. Given a static graph $G$, the task is to assign to each edge one time-label between 1 and $\Delta$ such that, in the resulting periodic temporal graph with period~$\Delta$, the duration of the fastest temporal path from any vertex $u$ to any other vertex $v$ is at most $\alpha$ times the distance between $u$ and $v$ in $G$. Here, the value of $\alpha$ measures how much the shortest paths are allowed to be \emph{stretched} once we assign the periodic time-labels. Our results span three different directions: First, we provide a series of approximation and NP-hardness results. Second, we provide approximation and fixed-parameter algorithms. Among them, we provide a simple polynomial-time algorithm (the \textit{radius-algorithm}) which always guarantees an approximation strictly smaller than $\Delta$, and which also computes the optimum stretch in some cases. Third, we consider a parameterized local search extension of the problem where we are given the temporal labeling of the graph, but we are allowed to change the time-labels of at most $k$ edges; for this problem we prove that it is W[2]-hard but admits an XP algorithm with respect to $k$.</p></details> |  |

GDFusion opens up the underexplored aspects of temporal fusion within the VisionOcc framework, focusing on both temporal cues and fusion strategies. It systematically examines the entire VisionOcc pipeline, identifying three fundamental yet previously overlooked temporal cues: scene-level consistency, motion calibration, and geometric complementation. These cues capture diverse facets of temporal evolution and make distinct contributions across various modules in the VisionOcc framework. To effectively fuse temporal signals across heterogeneous representations, we propose a novel fusion strategy by reinterpreting the formulation of vanilla RNNs. This reinterpretation leverages gradient descent on features to unify the integration of diverse temporal information, seamlessly embedding the proposed temporal cues into the network. Extensive experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that GDFusion significantly outperforms established baselines. Notably, on Occ3D benchmark, it achieves 1.4\%-4.8\% mIoU improvements and reduces memory consumption by 27\%-72\%.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Can Local Representation Alignment RNNs Solve Temporal Tasks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13531v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are commonly used for real-time processing, streaming data, and cases where the amount of training samples is limited. Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is the predominant algorithm for training RNNs; however, it is frequently criticized for being prone to exploding and vanishing gradients and being biologically implausible. In this paper, we present and evaluate a target propagation-based method for RNNs, which uses local updates and seeks to reduce the said instabilities. Having stable RNN models increases their practical use in a wide range of fields such as natural language processing, time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, control systems, and robotics. The proposed solution uses local representation alignment (LRA). We thoroughly analyze the performance of this method, experiment with normalization and different local error functions, and invalidate certain assumptions about the behavior of this type of learning. Namely, we demonstrate that despite the decomposition of the network into sub-graphs, the model still suffers from vanishing gradients. We also show that gradient clipping as proposed in LRA has little to no effect on network performance. This results in an LRA RNN model that is very difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. We address this by introducing gradient regularization in the direction of the update and demonstrate that this modification promotes gradient flow and meaningfully impacts convergence. We compare and discuss the performance of the algorithm, and we show that the regularized LRA RNN considerably outperforms the unregularized version on three landmark tasks: temporal order, 3-bit temporal order, and random permutation.</p></details> |  |

Our approach employs attention mechanisms to dynamically weight the contribution of different modalities, along with a specialized tensor interpretation module for feature extraction. To facilitate rapid model iteration in industry applications, we incorporate a mature auto-training scheme that streamlines optimization. When applied to real-world financial datasets, CMTF demonstrates improvements over baseline models in forecasting stock price movements and provides a scalable and effective solution for cross-modal integration in financial market prediction.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

Current approaches face two challenges: (i) static image limitations including ambiguous local feature similarities and fine-grained structural details, and (ii) dynamic video complexities arising from rapid instrument motion and persistent visual occlusions. While existing methods mainly focus on spatial feature extraction, they fundamentally overlook temporal dependencies in surgical video streams. To address this, we present temporal asymmetric feature propagation network, a bidirectional attention architecture enabling cross-frame feature propagation. The proposed method contains a temporal query propagator that integrates multi-directional consistency constraints to enhance frame-specific feature representation, and an aggregated asymmetric feature pyramid module that preserves discriminative features for anatomical structures and surgical instruments. Our framework uniquely enables both temporal guidance and contextual reasoning for surgical scene understanding. Comprehensive evaluations on two public benchmarks show the proposed method outperforms the current SOTA methods by a large margin, with +16.4\% mIoU on EndoVis2018 and +3.3\% mAP on Endoscapes2023.

The POMDP actions influence both system dynamics (control) and the emission function (perception). Beyond task completion, the planner seeks to maximize information gain about certain temporal events (the secret) through coordinated perception and control. To enable active information acquisition, we introduce minimizing the Shannon conditional entropy of the secret as a planning objective, alongside maximizing the probability of satisfying the temporal logic formula within a finite horizon. Using a variant of observable operators in hidden Markov models (HMMs) and POMDPs, we establish key properties of the conditional entropy gradient with respect to policy parameters. These properties facilitate efficient policy gradient computation. We validate our approach through graph-based examples, inspired by common security applications with UAV surveillance.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce VistaDPO, a novel framework for Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Direct Preference Optimization. VistaDPO enhances text-video preference alignment across three hierarchical levels: i) Instance Level, aligning overall video content with responses; ii) Temporal Level, aligning video temporal semantics with event descriptions; and iii) Perceptive Level, aligning spatial objects with language tokens. Given the lack of datasets for fine-grained video-language preference alignment, we construct VistaDPO-7k, a dataset of 7.2K QA pairs annotated with chosen and rejected responses, along with spatial-temporal grounding information such as timestamps, keyframes, and bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Video Hallucination, Video QA, and Captioning performance tasks demonstrate that VistaDPO significantly improves the performance of existing LVMs, effectively mitigating video-language misalignment and hallucination.

While existing temporal logic planning algorithms can synthesize correct-by-construction plans, they typically lack reactivity to unexpected failures of robot skills, which can compromise mission performance. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a reactive LTL planning algorithm that adapts to unexpected failures during deployment. Specifically, the proposed algorithm reassigns sub-tasks to robots based on their functioning skills and locally revises team plans to accommodate these new assignments and ensure mission completion. The main novelty of the proposed algorithm is its ability to handle cases where mission completion becomes impossible due to limited functioning robots. Instead of reporting mission failure, the algorithm strategically prioritizes the most crucial sub-tasks and locally revises the team's plans, as per user-specified priorities, to minimize mission violations. We provide theoretical conditions under which the proposed framework computes the minimum-violation task reassignments and team plans. We provide numerical and hardware experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSTAF: Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Attention Fusion Transformer for Motor Imagery Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13220v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery classification offer promising solutions in neurorehabilitation and assistive technologies by enabling communication between the brain and external devices. However, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals and significant inter-subject variability cause substantial challenges for developing robust cross-subject classification models. This paper introduces a novel Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Attention Fusion (SSTAF) Transformer specifically designed for upper-limb motor imagery classification. Our architecture consists of a spectral transformer and a spatial transformer, followed by a transformer block and a classifier network. Each module is integrated with attention mechanisms that dynamically attend to the most discriminative patterns across multiple domains, such as spectral frequencies, spatial electrode locations, and temporal dynamics. The short-time Fourier transform is incorporated to extract features in the time-frequency domain to make it easier for the model to obtain a better feature distinction. We evaluated our SSTAF Transformer model on two publicly available datasets, the EEGMMIDB dataset, and BCI Competition IV-2a. SSTAF Transformer achieves an accuracy of 76.83% and 68.30% in the data sets, respectively, outperforms traditional CNN-based architectures and a few existing transformer-based approaches.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Temporal Attention Pooling for Frequency Dynamic Convolution in Sound Event Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12670v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning, particularly frequency dynamic convolution (FDY conv), have significantly improved sound event detection (SED) by enabling frequency-adaptive feature extraction. However, FDY conv relies on temporal average pooling, which treats all temporal frames equally, limiting its ability to capture transient sound events such as alarm bells, door knocks, and speech plosives. To address this limitation, we propose temporal attention pooling frequency dynamic convolution (TFD conv) to replace temporal average pooling with temporal attention pooling (TAP). TAP adaptively weights temporal features through three complementary mechanisms: time attention pooling (TA) for emphasizing salient features, velocity attention pooling (VA) for capturing transient changes, and conventional average pooling for robustness to stationary signals. Ablation studies show that TFD conv improves average PSDS1 by 3.02% over FDY conv with only a 14.8% increase in parameter count. Classwise ANOVA and Tukey HSD analysis further demonstrate that TFD conv significantly enhances detection performance for transient-heavy events, outperforming existing FDY conv models. Notably, TFD conv achieves a maximum PSDS1 score of 0.456, surpassing previous state-of-the-art SED systems. We also explore the compatibility of TAP with other FDY conv variants, including dilated FDY conv (DFD conv), partial FDY conv (PFD conv), and multi-dilated FDY conv (MDFD conv). Among these, the integration of TAP with MDFD conv achieves the best result with a PSDS1 score of 0.459, validating the complementary strengths of temporal attention and multi-scale frequency adaptation. These findings establish TFD conv as a powerful and generalizable framework for enhancing both transient sensitivity and overall feature robustness in SED.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transfer Learning for Temporal Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10925v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction on graphs has applications spanning from recommender systems to drug discovery. Temporal link prediction (TLP) refers to predicting future links in a temporally evolving graph and adds additional complexity related to the dynamic nature of graphs. State-of-the-art TLP models incorporate memory modules alongside graph neural networks to learn both the temporal mechanisms of incoming nodes and the evolving graph topology. However, memory modules only store information about nodes seen at train time, and hence such models cannot be directly transferred to entirely new graphs at test time and deployment. In this work, we study a new transfer learning task for temporal link prediction, and develop transfer-effective methods for memory-laden models. Specifically, motivated by work showing the informativeness of structural signals for the TLP task, we augment a structural mapping module to the existing TLP model architectures, which learns a mapping from graph structural (topological) features to memory embeddings. Our work paves the way for a memory-free foundation model for TLP.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Flow Intelligence: Robust Feature Matching via Temporal Signature Correlation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11949v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature matching across video streams remains a cornerstone challenge in computer vision. Increasingly, robust multimodal matching has garnered interest in robotics, surveillance, remote sensing, and medical imaging. While traditional rely on detecting and matching spatial features, they break down when faced with noisy, misaligned, or cross-modal data. Recent deep learning methods have improved robustness through learned representations, but remain constrained by their dependence on extensive training data and computational demands. We present Flow Intelligence, a paradigm-shifting approach that moves beyond spatial features by focusing on temporal motion patterns exclusively. Instead of detecting traditional keypoints, our method extracts motion signatures from pixel blocks across consecutive frames and extract temporal motion signatures between videos. These motion-based descriptors achieve natural invariance to translation, rotation, and scale variations while remaining robust across different imaging modalities. This novel approach also requires no pretraining data, eliminates the need for spatial feature detection, enables cross-modal matching using only temporal motion, and it outperforms existing methods in challenging scenarios where traditional approaches fail. By leveraging motion rather than appearance, Flow Intelligence enables robust, real-time video feature matching in diverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541v3)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, similar to most RGBT fusion tasks, it still mainly relies on manually aligned multimodal image pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Multimodal Spatio-temporal Graph learning Network (MSGNet) for alignment-free RGBT VOD problem by leveraging the robust graph representation learning model. Specifically, we first design an Adaptive Partitioning Layer (APL) to estimate the corresponding regions of the Thermal image within the RGB image (high-resolution), achieving a preliminary inexact alignment. Then, we introduce the Spatial Sparse Graph Learning Module (S-SGLM) which employs a sparse information passing mechanism on the estimated inexact alignment to achieve reliable information interaction between different modalities. Moreover, to fully exploit the temporal cues for RGBT VOD problem, we introduce Hybrid Structured Temporal Modeling (HSTM), which involves a Temporal Sparse Graph Learning Module (T-SGLM) and Temporal Star Block (TSB). T-SGLM aims to filter out some redundant information between adjacent frames by employing the sparse aggregation mechanism on the temporal graph. Meanwhile, TSB is dedicated to achieving the complementary learning of local spatial relationships. Extensive comparative experiments conducted on both the aligned dataset VT-VOD50 and the unaligned dataset UVT-VOD2024 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. Our project will be made available on our website for free public access.</p></details> |  |

While numerous efforts have been devoted to static image scenarios, ensuring temporal coherence in video-based normal estimation remains a formidable challenge. Instead of merely augmenting existing methods with temporal components, we present NormalCrafter to leverage the inherent temporal priors of video diffusion models. To secure high-fidelity normal estimation across sequences, we propose Semantic Feature Regularization (SFR), which aligns diffusion features with semantic cues, encouraging the model to concentrate on the intrinsic semantics of the scene. Moreover, we introduce a two-stage training protocol that leverages both latent and pixel space learning to preserve spatial accuracy while maintaining long temporal context. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our method, showcasing a superior performance in generating temporally consistent normal sequences with intricate details from diverse videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, Project Page: https://normalcrafter.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Encoding Temporal Graph Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11386v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) have demonstrated significant success in dynamic graph tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Both tasks comprise transductive settings, where the model predicts links among known nodes, and in inductive settings, where it generalises learned patterns to previously unseen nodes. Existing TGN designs face a dilemma under these dual scenarios. Anonymous TGNs, which rely solely on temporal and structural information, offer strong inductive generalisation but struggle to distinguish known nodes. In contrast, non-anonymous TGNs leverage node features to excel in transductive tasks yet fail to adapt to new nodes. To address this challenge, we propose Trajectory Encoding TGN (TETGN). Our approach introduces automatically expandable node identifiers (IDs) as learnable temporal positional features and performs message passing over these IDs to capture each node's historical context. By integrating this trajectory-aware module with a standard TGN using multi-head attention, TETGN effectively balances transductive accuracy with inductive generalisation. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that TETGN significantly outperforms strong baselines on both link prediction and node classification tasks, demonstrating its ability to unify the advantages of anonymous and non-anonymous models for dynamic graph learning.</p></details> |  |

We advocate defining these seeds through Influence Propagation Paths (IPPs), which is essential for scaling up the network. Our focus lies in efficiently labeling IPPs and accurately predicting these seeds, while addressing the often-overlooked cold-start issue prevalent in temporal networks. Our strategy introduces a motif-based labeling method and a tensorized Temporal Graph Network (TGN) tailored for multi-relational temporal graphs, bolstering prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, we augment cold-start nodes with new neighbors from historical data sharing similar IPPs. The recommendation system within an online team-based gaming environment presents subtle impact on the social network, forming multi-relational (i.e., weak and strong) temporal graphs for our empirical IM study. We conduct offline experiments to assess prediction accuracy and model training efficiency, complemented by online A/B testing to validate practical network growth and the effectiveness in addressing the cold-start issue.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICWSM 2025</p></details> |

Users frequently require aggregated statistical information derived from historical sensory data within specific spatial and temporal boundaries. To address this, users submit aggregation query requests with spatial-temporal constraints to target UAVs that store the relevant data. These UAVs process and return the query results, which can be aggregated within the network during transmission to conserve energy and bandwidth-resources that are inherently limited in UAV networks. However,the dynamic topology caused by UAV mobility, coupled with these resource constraints, makes efficient in-network aggregation challenging without compromising user query delay. To the best of our knowledge, existing research has yet to adequately explore spatial-temporal range aggregation queries in the context of UAV networks. In this paper, we propose ESTA, an Efficient Spatial-Temporal range Aggregation query processing algorithm tailored for UAV networks. ESTA leverages pre-planned UAV trajectories to construct a topology change graph that models the network's evolving connectivity. It then employs an efficient shortest path algorithm to determine the minimum query response delay. Subsequently, while adhering to user-specified delay constraints, ESTA transforms the in-network aggregation process into a series of set cover problems, which are solved recursively to build a Spatial-Temporal Aggregation Tree (STAT). This tree enables the identification of an energy-efficient routing path for aggregating and delivering query results. Extensive simulations demonstrate that ESTA reduces energy consumption by more than 50% compared to a baseline algorithm, all while satisfying the required query delay.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

Despite its widespread use, it has only been recently that researchers have begun to actively study its finite time behavior, including the finite time bound on mean squared error and sample complexity. On the empirical side, experience replay has been a key ingredient in the success of deep RL algorithms, but its theoretical effects on RL have yet to be fully understood. In this paper, we present a simple decomposition of the Markovian noise terms and provide finite-time error bounds for TD-learning with experience replay. Specifically, under the Markovian observation model, we demonstrate that for both the averaged iterate and final iterate cases, the error term induced by a constant step-size can be effectively controlled by the size of the replay buffer and the mini-batch sampled from the experience replay buffer.</p></details> |  |

A promising approach to enhance dietary monitoring in everyday life involves automated detection of food intake gestures. This study introduces a skeleton based approach using a model that combines a dilated spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) with a bidirectional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM) framework, as called ST-GCN-BiLSTM, to detect intake gestures. The skeleton-based method provides key benefits, including environmental robustness, reduced data dependency, and enhanced privacy preservation. Two datasets were employed for model validation. The OREBA dataset, which consists of laboratory-recorded videos, achieved segmental F1-scores of 86.18% and 74.84% for identifying eating and drinking gestures. Additionally, a self-collected dataset using smartphone recordings in more adaptable experimental conditions was evaluated with the model trained on OREBA, yielding F1-scores of 85.40% and 67.80% for detecting eating and drinking gestures. The results not only confirm the feasibility of utilizing skeleton data for intake gesture detection but also highlight the robustness of the proposed approach in cross-dataset validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript has been accepted in 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (IEEE EMBC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Long Video Modeling Based on Temporal Dynamic Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10443v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant breakthroughs in video understanding. However, existing models still struggle with long video processing due to the context length constraint of LLMs and the vast amount of information within the video. Although some recent methods are designed for long video understanding, they often lose crucial information during token compression and struggle with additional modality like audio. In this work, we propose a dynamic long video encoding method utilizing the temporal relationship between frames, named Temporal Dynamic Context (TDC). Firstly, we segment the video into semantically consistent scenes based on inter-frame similarities, then encode each frame into tokens using visual-audio encoders. Secondly, we propose a novel temporal context compressor to reduce the number of tokens within each segment. Specifically, we employ a query-based Transformer to aggregate video, audio, and instruction text tokens into a limited set of temporal context tokens. Finally, we feed the static frame tokens and the temporal context tokens into the LLM for video understanding. Furthermore, to handle extremely long videos, we propose a training-free chain-of-thought strategy that progressively extracts answers from multiple video segments. These intermediate answers serve as part of the reasoning process and contribute to the final answer. We conduct extensive experiments on general video understanding and audio-video understanding benchmarks, where our method demonstrates strong performance.

| **[Cumulative-Time Signal Temporal Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10325v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a widely adopted specification language in cyber-physical systems for expressing critical temporal requirements, such as safety conditions and response time. However, STL's expressivity is not sufficient to capture the cumulative duration during which a property holds within an interval of time. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Cumulative-Time Signal Temporal Logic (CT-STL) that operates over discrete-time signals and extends STL with a new cumulative-time operator. This operator compares the sum of all time steps for which its nested formula is true with a threshold. We present both a qualitative and a quantitative (robustness) semantics for CT-STL and prove both their soundness and completeness properties. We provide an efficient online monitoring algorithm for both semantics. Finally, we show the applicability of CT-STL in two case studies: specifying and monitoring cumulative temporal requirements for a microgrid and an artificial pancreas.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, existing methods, such as mixed-integer programming and nonlinear programming, often struggle to efficiently solve control problems with complex, long-horizon STL specifications. This study introduces \textit{STLCCP}, a novel convex optimization-based framework that leverages key structural properties of STL: monotonicity of the robustness function, its hierarchical tree structure, and correspondence between convexity/concavity in optimizations and conjunctiveness/disjunctiveness in specifications. The framework begins with a structure-aware decomposition of STL formulas, transforming the problem into an equivalent difference of convex (DC) programs. This is then solved sequentially as a convex quadratic program using an improved version of the convex-concave procedure (CCP). To further enhance efficiency, we develop a smooth approximation of the robustness function using a function termed the \textit{mellowmin} function, specifically tailored to the proposed framework. Numerical experiments on motion planning benchmarks demonstrate that \textit{STLCCP} can efficiently handle complex scenarios over long horizons, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | 32 pages |

For instance, in bike sharing demand prediction, error patterns translate to relocation costs. However, commonly used error metrics in GeoAI evaluate predictions point-wise, neglecting effects such as spatial heterogeneity, autocorrelation, and the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem. We put forward Optimal Transport (OT) as a spatial evaluation metric and loss function. The proposed framework, called GeOT, assesses the performance of prediction models by quantifying the transport costs associated with their prediction errors. Through experiments on real and synthetic data, we demonstrate that 1) the spatial distribution of prediction errors relates to real-world costs in many applications, 2) OT captures these spatial costs more accurately than existing metrics, and 3) OT enhances comparability across spatial and temporal scales. Finally, we advocate for leveraging OT as a loss function in neural networks to improve the spatial accuracy of predictions. Experiments with bike sharing, charging station, and traffic datasets show that spatial costs are significantly reduced with only marginal changes to non-spatial error metrics. Thus, this approach not only offers a spatially explicit tool for model evaluation and selection, but also integrates spatial considerations into model training.

Accurate air quality prediction is a complex multivariate spatiotemporal problem, that involves interactions across temporal patterns, pollutant correlations, spatial station dependencies, and particularly meteorological influences that govern pollutant dispersion and chemical transformations. Existing works underestimate the critical role of atmospheric conditions in air quality prediction and neglect comprehensive meteorological data utilization, thereby impairing the modeling of dynamic interdependencies between air quality and meteorological data. To overcome this, we propose MDSTNet, an encoder-decoder framework that explicitly models air quality observations and atmospheric conditions as distinct modalities, integrating multi-pressure-level meteorological data and weather forecasts to capture atmosphere-pollution dependencies for prediction. Meantime, we construct ChinaAirNet, the first nationwide dataset combining air quality records with multi-pressure-level meteorological observations. Experimental results on ChinaAirNet demonstrate MDSTNet's superiority, substantially reducing 48-hour prediction errors by 17.54\% compared to the state-of-the-art model.

It faces a great challenge yet to be addressed - that is, the significant distributional differences among monitoring data from multiple modes make it difficult for the models to extract shared feature representations related to system health conditions. In response to this problem, this paper introduces a novel method called attention-based multiscale temporal fusion network. The multiscale depthwise convolution and gated recurrent unit are employed to extract multiscale contextual local features and long-short-term features. Instance normalization is applied to suppress mode-specific information. Furthermore, a temporal attention mechanism is designed to focus on critical time points with higher cross-mode shared information, thereby enhancing the accuracy of fault diagnosis. The proposed model is applied to Tennessee Eastman process dataset and three-phase flow facility dataset. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior diagnostic performance and maintains a small model size.

While current methods trained on large synthetic datasets achieve high tracking accuracy and generalize well to endoscopic scenes, their runtime performances fail to meet the low-latency requirements necessary for real-time surgical applications. To address this limitation, we propose LiteTracker, a low-latency method for tissue tracking in endoscopic video streams. LiteTracker builds on a state-of-the-art long-term point tracking method, and introduces a set of training-free runtime optimizations. These optimizations enable online, frame-by-frame tracking by leveraging a temporal memory buffer for efficient feature reuse and utilizing prior motion for accurate track initialization. LiteTracker demonstrates significant runtime improvements being around 7x faster than its predecessor and 2x than the state-of-the-art. Beyond its primary focus on efficiency, LiteTracker delivers high-accuracy tracking and occlusion prediction, performing competitively on both the STIR and SuPer datasets. We believe LiteTracker is an important step toward low-latency tissue tracking for real-time surgical applications in the operating room.</p></details> |  |

We show that the standard training objective of diffusion models, when applied with temporally consistent noise, encourages the model to be equivariant to spatial transformations in input video and noise. This enables our model to better follow motion patterns from the input video, producing aligned motion and high-fidelity frames. Furthermore, we extend our approach to 3D-consistent video generation by attaching noise as textures on 3D meshes, ensuring 3D consistency in sim-to-real applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in motion alignment, 3D consistency, and video quality while requiring only a few sampling steps in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPOT: Spatio-Temporal Pattern Mining and Optimization for Load Consolidation in Freight Transportation Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09680v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Freight consolidation has significant potential to reduce transportation costs and mitigate congestion and pollution. An effective load consolidation plan relies on carefully chosen consolidation points to ensure alignment with existing transportation management processes, such as driver scheduling, personnel planning, and terminal operations. This complexity represents a significant challenge when searching for optimal consolidation strategies. Traditional optimization-based methods provide exact solutions, but their computational complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances and they fail to leverage historical data. Machine learning-based approaches address these issues but often ignore operational constraints, leading to infeasible consolidation plans. This work proposes SPOT, an end-to-end approach that integrates the benefits of machine learning (ML) and optimization for load consolidation. The ML component plays a key role in the planning phase by identifying the consolidation points through spatio-temporal clustering and constrained frequent itemset mining, while the optimization selects the most cost-effective feasible consolidation routes for a given operational day. Extensive experiments conducted on industrial load data demonstrate that SPOT significantly reduces travel distance and transportation costs (by about 50% on large terminals) compared to the existing industry-standard load planning strategy and a neighborhood-based heuristic.

| **[Capturing Longitudinal Changes in Brain Morphology Using Temporally Parameterized Neural Displacement Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09514v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Longitudinal image registration enables studying temporal changes in brain morphology which is useful in applications where monitoring the growth or atrophy of specific structures is important. However this task is challenging due to; noise/artifacts in the data and quantifying small anatomical changes between sequential scans. We propose a novel longitudinal registration method that models structural changes using temporally parameterized neural displacement fields. Specifically, we implement an implicit neural representation (INR) using a multi-layer perceptron that serves as a continuous coordinate-based approximation of the deformation field at any time point. In effect, for any N scans of a particular subject, our model takes as input a 3D spatial coordinate location x, y, z and a corresponding temporal representation t and learns to describe the continuous morphology of structures for both observed and unobserved points in time. Furthermore, we leverage the analytic derivatives of the INR to derive a new regularization function that enforces monotonic rate of change in the trajectory of the voxels, which is shown to provide more biologically plausible patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on 4D brain MR registration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL)</p></details> |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we establish a novel error analysis for parametric finite element approximations of genus-1 axisymmetric mean curvature flow, formulated using two classical second-order time-stepping methods: the Crank-Nicolson method and the BDF2 method. Our results establish optimal error bounds in both the L^2-norm and H^1-norm, along with a superconvergence result in the H^1-norm for each fully discrete approximation. Finally, we perform convergence experiments to validate the theoretical findings and present numerical simulations for various genus-1 surfaces. Through a series of comparative experiments, we also demonstrate that the methods proposed in this paper exhibit significant mesh advantages.</p></details> |  |

Simultaneous control and trajectory estimation using probabilistic graphical models has been proposed as a unified solution to these challenges. Previous work, however, relies heavily on appropriate Gaussian priors and is limited to holonomic robots with linear time-varying models. The current research extends graphical optimization methods to vehicles with arbitrary dynamical models via Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation and Local Adaptation (STELA). The overall approach initializes feasible trajectories using a kinodynamic, sampling-based motion planner. Then, it simultaneously: (i) estimates the past trajectory based on noisy observations, and (ii) adapts the controls to be executed to minimize deviations from the planned, feasible trajectory, while avoiding collisions. The proposed factor graph representation of trajectories in STELA can be applied for any dynamical system given access to first or second-order state update equations, and introduces the duration of execution between two states in the trajectory discretization as an optimization variable. These features provide both generalization and flexibility in trajectory following. In addition to targeting computational efficiency, the proposed strategy performs incremental updates of the factor graph using the iSAM algorithm and introduces a time-window mechanism. This mechanism allows the factor graph to be dynamically updated to operate over a limited history and forward horizon of the planned trajectory. This enables online updates of controls at a minimum of 10Hz. Experiments demonstrate that STELA achieves at least comparable performance to previous frameworks on idealized vehicles with linear dynamics.[...]</p></details> | [Accepted] RSS 2025 |

While, the spin is not directly observable in standard broadcasting videos, we show that it can be inferred from the ball's trajectory in the video. We present a novel method to infer the initial spin and 3D trajectory from the corresponding 2D trajectory in a video. Without ground truth labels for broadcast videos, we train a neural network solely on synthetic data. Due to the choice of our input data representation, physically correct synthetic training data, and using targeted augmentations, the network naturally generalizes to real data. Notably, these simple techniques are sufficient to achieve generalization. No real data at all is required for training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a method for spin and trajectory prediction in simple monocular broadcast videos, achieving an accuracy of 92.0% in spin classification and a 2D reprojection error of 0.19% of the image diagonal.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)</p></details> |

However, existing methods face robotic hardware dependency and control frequency mismatches between teleoperation devices and robotic platforms. Our approach automatically extracts kinematic parameters from unified robot description format (URDF) files, and enables pluggable deployment across diverse robots through uniform interfaces. The proposed interpolation algorithm bridges the frequency gap between low-rate human inputs and high-frequency robotic control commands through online continuous trajectory generation, \n{while requiring no access to the closed, bottom-level control loop}. To enhance trajectory smoothness, we introduce a minimum-stretch spline that optimizes the motion quality. The system further provides precision and rapid modes to accommodate different task requirements. Experiments across various robotic platforms including dual-arm ones demonstrate generality and smooth operation performance of our methods. The code is developed in C++ with python interface, and available at https://github.com/IRMV-Manipulation-Group/UTTG.</p></details> |  |

Existing deep generative models learn from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with increasing data size. More importantly, they often lack control mechanisms to guide the generated trajectories under constraints such as enforcing specific visits. To address these limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem for effectively handling multiple spatiotemporal constraints. We introduce Geo-Llama, a novel LLM finetuning framework that can enforce multiple explicit visit constraints while maintaining contextual coherence of the generated trajectories. In this approach, pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned on trajectory data with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a specific time and location. This strategy enables the model to capture spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders while maintaining flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional modular methods suffer from error propagation, while existing end-to-end models typically employ static one-shot inference paradigms that inadequately capture the dynamic changes of the environment. ARTEMIS takes a different method by generating trajectory waypoints sequentially, preserves critical temporal dependencies while dynamically routing scene-specific queries to specialized expert networks. It effectively relieves trajectory quality degradation issues encountered when guidance information is ambiguous, and overcomes the inherent representational limitations of singular network architectures when processing diverse driving scenarios. Additionally, we use a lightweight batch reallocation strategy that significantly improves the training speed of the Mixture-of-Experts model. Through experiments on the NAVSIM dataset, ARTEMIS exhibits superior competitive performance, achieving 87.0 PDMS and 83.1 EPDMS with ResNet-34 backbone, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this, an end-to-end foot trajectory and force optimization framework (FTFOF) is proposed, which optimizes foot adhesion and detachment forces through trajectory adjustments. This framework accepts general foot trajectory constraints and user-defined parameters as input, ultimately producing an optimal single foot trajectory. It integrates three-segment $C^2$ continuous Bezier curves, tailored to various foot structures, enabling the generation of effective climbing trajectories. A dilate-based GRU predictive model establishes the relationship between foot trajectories and the corresponding foot forces. Multi-objective optimization algorithms, combined with a redundancy hierarchical strategy, identify the most suitable foot trajectory for specific tasks, thereby ensuring optimal performance across detachment force, adhesion force and vibration amplitude. Experimental validation on the quadruped climbing robot MST-M3F showed that, compared to commonly used trajectories in existing legged climbing robots, the proposed framework achieved reductions in maximum detachment force by 28 \%, vibration amplitude by 82 \%, which ensures the stable climbing of dry adhesion legged climbing robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning with Model Predictive Control for Obstacle Avoidance Considering Prediction Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19193v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel trajectory planner for autonomous robots, specifically designed to enhance navigation by incorporating dynamic obstacle avoidance within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) and Navigation 2 (Nav2) framework. The proposed method utilizes Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a focus on handling the uncertainties associated with the movement prediction of dynamic obstacles. Unlike existing Nav2 trajectory planners which primarily deal with static obstacles or react to the current position of dynamic obstacles, this planner predicts future obstacle positions using a stochastic Vector Auto-Regressive Model (VAR). The obstacles' future positions are represented by probability distributions, and collision avoidance is achieved through constraints based on the Mahalanobis distance, ensuring the robot avoids regions where obstacles are likely to be. This approach considers the robot's kinodynamic constraints, enabling it to track a reference path while adapting to real-time changes in the environment. The paper details the implementation, including obstacle prediction, tracking, and the construction of feasible sets for MPC. Simulation results in a Gazebo environment demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in scenarios where robots must navigate around each other, showing improved collision avoidance capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to IFAC for publication under a Creative Commons Licence CC-BY-NC-ND</p></details> |

Therefore, fin-driven autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can achieve high maneuverability with a smaller number of actuators, but their control is challenging. This study proposes an analytic control allocation method for underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). By integrating an adaptive hybrid feedback controller, we enable an AUV with 4 actuators to move in 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) in simulation and up to 5-DOF in real-world experiments. The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art control allocation techniques in 6-DOF trajectory tracking simulations, exhibiting centimeter-scale accuracy and higher energy and computational efficiency. Real-world pool experiments confirmed the method's robustness and efficacy in tracking complex 3D trajectories, with significant computational efficiency gains 0.007 (ms) vs. 22.28 (ms). Our method offers a balance between performance, energy efficiency, and computational efficiency, showcasing a potential avenue for more effective tracking of a large number of DOF for under-actuated underwater robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Stochastic Thermodynamics Directly from Correlation and Trajectory-Fluctuation Currents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19007v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markedly increased computational power and data acquisition have led to growing interest in data-driven inverse dynamics problems. These seek to answer a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in stochastic thermodynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 appendices (10 pages), 4 figures; https://csc.ucdavis.edu/~cmg/compmech/pubs/currents.htm</p></details> |
| **[DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> |  |

Critical to these improvements is understanding AVs' longitudinal behavior, relying heavily on real-world trajectory data. Existing open-source trajectory datasets of AV, however, often fall short in refinement, reliability, and completeness, hindering effective performance metrics analysis and model development. This study addresses these challenges by creating a Unified Longitudinal TRAjectory dataset for AVs (Ultra-AV) to analyze their microscopic longitudinal driving behaviors. This dataset compiles data from 13 distinct sources, encompassing various AV types, test sites, and experiment scenarios. We established a three-step data processing: 1. extraction of longitudinal trajectory data, 2. general data cleaning, and 3. data-specific cleaning to obtain the longitudinal trajectory data and car-following trajectory data. The validity of the processed data is affirmed through performance evaluations across safety, mobility, stability, and sustainability, along with an analysis of the relationships between variables in car-following models. Our work not only furnishes researchers with standardized data and metrics for longitudinal AV behavior studies but also sets guidelines for data collection and model development.</p></details> | NA |

While these methods achieve exceptional performance in defined datasets, they usually rely on the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption and thus tend to be vulnerable to distribution shifts that occur in the real world. In addition, these methods lack explainability due to their black box nature, which poses further challenges in terms of the approval process and social trustworthiness. Therefore, in order to use the capabilities of data-driven statistical AI methods in a reliable and trustworthy manner, the concept of TrustMHE is introduced and investigated in this paper. TrustMHE represents a complementary approach, independent of the underlying AI systems, that combines AI-driven out-of-distribution detection with control-driven moving horizon estimation (MHE) to enable not only detection and monitoring, but also intervention. The effectiveness of the proposed TrustMHE is evaluated and proven in three simulation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), JCluj-Napoca, Romania, June 22-25, 2025</p></details> |

While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Reupl...</summary><p>Reuploaded with new version-- equation 16 was incorrect</p></details> |

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

However, they have seen limited application in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. This is due to the difficulty in reasoning about collisions in radiance models and the computational complexity associated with operating in dense models. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer operating in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method to rigorously upper-bound the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Then, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables efficient computation of this collision bound. Finally, this paper presents a method to optimize trajectories that avoid collisions in a Gaussian Splat. Experiments show that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in cluttered environments.

While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel mixed Bernstein-Fourier approximation framework tailored explicitly for optimal motion planning. Our proposed methodology leverages the uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials for nonperiodic behaviors while effectively capturing periodic dynamics through Fourier series. Theoretical results are established, including uniform convergence proofs for approximations of functions, derivatives, and integrals, as well as detailed error bound analyses. We further introduce a regulated least squares approach for determining approximation coefficients, enhancing numerical stability and practical applicability. Within an optimal control context, we establish feasibility and consistency of approximated solutions to their continuous counterparts. We also extend the covector mapping theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for approximating dual variables crucial in verifying the necessary optimality conditions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Comprehensive numerical examples illustrate the method's superior performance, demonstrating substantial improvements in computational efficiency and precision in scenarios with complex periodic constraints and dynamics. Our mixed Bernstein-Fourier methodology thus presents a robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient approach for advanced optimal trajectory planning in autonomous systems.</p></details> | 49 pages, 9 figures |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions. Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories. We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 30 figures, Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

There is a urgent need to minimize the data size in LLM training. Compared with data selection method, the data distillation method aims to synthesize a small number of data samples to achieve the training effect of the full data set and has better flexibility. Despite its successes in computer vision, the discreteness of text data has hitherto stymied its exploration in natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we proposed a method that involves learning pseudo prompt data based on trajectory matching and finding its nearest neighbor ID to achieve cross-architecture transfer. During the distillation process, we introduce a regularization loss to improve the robustness of our distilled data. To our best knowledge, this is the first data distillation work suitable for text generation tasks such as instruction tuning. Evaluations on two benchmarks, including ARC-Easy and MMLU instruction tuning datasets, established the superiority of our distillation approach over the SOTA data selection method LESS. Furthermore, our method demonstrates a good transferability over LLM structures (i.e., OPT to Llama).</p></details> |  |

Our framework begins by generating panoptic occupancy local semantic maps and accurate localization information from data aligned between a monocular camera, IMU, and GPS. This information is combined with input terrain point clouds or preloaded terrain information to initialize the planning process. We propose the Radiant Field-Informed Coverage Planning algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion field model to dynamically adjust the robot's coverage trajectory and speed based on environmental attributes such as dirtiness and dryness. By modeling the spatial influence of the robot's actions using a Gaussian field, ensures a speed-optimized, uniform coverage trajectory while adapting to varying environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building Real-time Awareness of Out-of-distribution in Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17277v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is essential for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles in real-world environments. Even well-trained machine learning models may produce unreliable predictions due to discrepancies between training data and real-world conditions encountered during inference. In particular, the training dataset tends to overrepresent common scenes (e.g., straight lanes) while underrepresenting less frequent ones (e.g., traffic circles). In addition, it often overlooks unpredictable real-world events such as sudden braking or falling objects. To ensure safety, it is critical to detect in real-time when a model's predictions become unreliable. Leveraging the intuition that in-distribution (ID) scenes exhibit error patterns similar to training data, while out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes do not, we introduce a principled, real-time approach for OOD detection by framing it as a change-point detection problem. We address the challenging settings where the OOD scenes are deceptive, meaning that they are not easily detectable by human intuitions. Our lightweight solutions can handle the occurrence of OOD at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |

In practice, safety constraints, including cost functions and budgets, are unknown or hard to specify, as it requires anticipation of all possible unsafe behaviors. We therefore address a general setting where the true safety definition is unknown, and has to be learned from sparsely labeled data. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety model that performs credit assignment to estimate each decision step's impact on the overall safety using a dataset of diverse trajectories and their corresponding binary safety labels (i.e., whether the corresponding trajectory is safe/unsafe). Second, we illustrate the architecture of our safety model to demonstrate its ability to learn a separate safety score for each timestep. Third, we reformulate the safe RL problem using the proposed safety model and derive an effective algorithm to optimize a safe yet rewarding policy. Finally, our empirical results corroborate our findings and show that this approach is effective in satisfying unknown safety definition, and scalable to various continuous control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SILM: A Subjective Intent Based Low-Latency Framework for Multiple Traffic Participants Joint Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16377v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a fundamental technology for advanced autonomous driving systems and represents one of the most challenging problems in the field of cognitive intelligence. Accurately predicting the future trajectories of each traffic participant is a prerequisite for building high safety and high reliability decision-making, planning, and control capabilities in autonomous driving. However, existing methods often focus solely on the motion of other traffic participants without considering the underlying intent behind that motion, which increases the uncertainty in trajectory prediction. Autonomous vehicles operate in real-time environments, meaning that trajectory prediction algorithms must be able to process data and generate predictions in real-time. While many existing methods achieve high accuracy, they often struggle to effectively handle heterogeneous traffic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Subjective Intent-based Low-latency framework for Multiple traffic participants joint trajectory prediction. Our method explicitly incorporates the subjective intent of traffic participants based on their key points, and predicts the future trajectories jointly without map, which ensures promising performance while significantly reducing the prediction latency. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset designed specifically for trajectory prediction. Related code and dataset will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

As this is a novel task, there is currently no relevant dataset available in the community. To address this gap, we first devised a new visualization language called Trajectory Visualization Language (TVL) to facilitate querying trajectory data and generating visualizations. Building on this foundation, we further proposed a dataset construction method that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with human efforts to create high-quality data. Specifically, we first generate TVLs using a comprehensive and systematic process, and then label each TVL with corresponding natural language questions using LLMs. This process results in the creation of the first large-scale Text-to-TrajVis dataset, named TrajVL, which contains 18,140 (question, TVL) pairs. Based on this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of multiple LLMs (GPT, Qwen, Llama, etc.) on this task. The experimental results demonstrate that this task is both feasible and highly challenging and merits further exploration within the research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[DriVerse: Navigation World Model for Driving Simulation via Multimodal Trajectory Prompting and Motion Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18576v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents DriVerse, a generative model for simulating navigation-driven driving scenes from a single image and a future trajectory. Previous autonomous driving world models either directly feed the trajectory or discrete control signals into the generation pipeline, leading to poor alignment between the control inputs and the implicit features of the 2D base generative model, which results in low-fidelity video outputs. Some methods use coarse textual commands or discrete vehicle control signals, which lack the precision to guide fine-grained, trajectory-specific video generation, making them unsuitable for evaluating actual autonomous driving algorithms. DriVerse introduces explicit trajectory guidance in two complementary forms: it tokenizes trajectories into textual prompts using a predefined trend vocabulary for seamless language integration, and converts 3D trajectories into 2D spatial motion priors to enhance control over static content within the driving scene. To better handle dynamic objects, we further introduce a lightweight motion alignment module, which focuses on the inter-frame consistency of dynamic pixels, significantly enhancing the temporal coherence of moving elements over long sequences. With minimal training and no need for additional data, DriVerse outperforms specialized models on future video generation tasks across both the nuScenes and Waymo datasets. The code and models will be released to the public.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Dynamic Intent Queries for Motion Transformer-based Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15766v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, accurately predicting the movements of other traffic participants is crucial, as it significantly influences a vehicle's planning processes. Modern trajectory prediction models strive to interpret complex patterns and dependencies from agent and map data. The Motion Transformer (MTR) architecture and subsequent work define the most accurate methods in common benchmarks such as the Waymo Open Motion Benchmark. The MTR model employs pre-generated static intention points as initial goal points for trajectory prediction. However, the static nature of these points frequently leads to misalignment with map data in specific traffic scenarios, resulting in unfeasible or unrealistic goal points. Our research addresses this limitation by integrating scene-specific dynamic intention points into the MTR model. This adaptation of the MTR model was trained and evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating dynamic intention points has a significant positive impact on trajectory prediction accuracy, especially for predictions over long time horizons. Furthermore, we analyze the impact on ground truth trajectories which are not compliant with the map data or are illegal maneuvers.</p></details> |  |
| **[SocialMOIF: Multi-Order Intention Fusion for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15616v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The analysis and prediction of agent trajectories are crucial for decision-making processes in intelligent systems, with precise short-term trajectory forecasting being highly significant across a range of applications. Agents and their social interactions have been quantified and modeled by researchers from various perspectives; however, substantial limitations exist in the current work due to the inherent high uncertainty of agent intentions and the complex higher-order influences among neighboring groups. SocialMOIF is proposed to tackle these challenges, concentrating on the higher-order intention interactions among neighboring groups while reinforcing the primary role of first-order intention interactions between neighbors and the target agent. This method develops a multi-order intention fusion model to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of both direct and indirect intention information. Within SocialMOIF, a trajectory distribution approximator is designed to guide the trajectories toward values that align more closely with the actual data, thereby enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, a global trajectory optimizer is introduced to enable more accurate and efficient parallel predictions. By incorporating a novel loss function that accounts for distance and direction during training, experimental results demonstrate that the model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics in both dynamic and static datasets.</p></details> | 11 pages,6 figures |
| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v5)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025.

Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. Visuomotor policies enhanced by DiffOG generate smoother, constraint-compliant action trajectories in a more interpretable way. DiffOG exhibits strong generalization capabilities and high flexibility. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Through Retrospection: Improving Trajectory Prediction for Automated Driving with Error Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13785v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In automated driving, predicting trajectories of surrounding vehicles supports reasoning about scene dynamics and enables safe planning for the ego vehicle. However, existing models handle predictions as an instantaneous task of forecasting future trajectories based on observed information. As time proceeds, the next prediction is made independently of the previous one, which means that the model cannot correct its errors during inference and will repeat them. To alleviate this problem and better leverage temporal data, we propose a novel retrospection technique. Through training on closed-loop rollouts the model learns to use aggregated feedback. Given new observations it reflects on previous predictions and analyzes its errors to improve the quality of subsequent predictions. Thus, the model can learn to correct systematic errors during inference. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse demonstrate a considerable decrease in minimum Average Displacement Error of up to 31.9% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline without retrospection. We further showcase the robustness of our technique by demonstrating a better handling of out-of-distribution scenarios with undetected road-users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lightweight LiDAR-Camera 3D Dynamic Object Detection and Multi-Class Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13647v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service mobile robots are often required to avoid dynamic objects while performing their tasks, but they usually have only limited computational resources. So we present a lightweight multi-modal framework for 3D object detection and trajectory prediction. Our system synergistically integrates LiDAR and camera inputs to achieve real-time perception of pedestrians, vehicles, and riders in 3D space. The framework proposes two novel modules: 1) a Cross-Modal Deformable Transformer (CMDT) for object detection with high accuracy and acceptable amount of computation, and 2) a Reference Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse trajectory prediction of mult-class objects with flexible trajectory lengths. Evaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate superior performance over existing methods across detection (+2.03% in mAP) and trajectory prediction (-0.408m in minADE5 of pedestrians) metrics. Remarkably, the system exhibits exceptional deployability - when implemented on a wheelchair robot with an entry-level NVIDIA 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.2 fps. To facilitate reproducibility and practical deployment, we release the related code of the method at https://github.com/TossherO/3D_Perception and its ROS inference version at https://github.com/TossherO/ros_packages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Robotic Skill Acquisition From a Suboptimal Demonstration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03131v4)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from Demonstration (LfD) has emerged as a crucial method for robots to acquire new skills. However, when given suboptimal task trajectory demonstrations with shape characteristics reflecting human preferences but subpar dynamic attributes such as slow motion, robots not only need to mimic the behaviors but also optimize the dynamic performance. In this work, we leverage optimization-based methods to search for a superior-performing trajectory whose shape is similar to that of the demonstrated trajectory. Specifically, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to quantify the difference between two trajectories and combine it with additional performance metrics, such as collision cost, to construct the cost function. Moreover, we develop a multi-policy version of the Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP), called MSTOMP, which is more stable and robust to parameter changes. To deal with the jitter in the demonstrated trajectory, we further utilize the gain-controlling method in the frequency domain to denoise the demonstration and propose a computationally more efficient metric, called Mean Square Error in the Spectrum (MSES), that measures the trajectories' differences in the frequency domain. We also theoretically highlight the connections between the time domain and the frequency domain methods. Finally, we verify our method in both simulation experiments and real-world experiments, showcasing its improved optimization performance and stability compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Estimation of Battery State of Health Using Reference Voltage Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13324v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of state of health (SOH) is critical for battery applications. Current model-based SOH estimation methods typically rely on low C-rate constant current tests to extract health parameters like solid phase volume fraction and lithium-ion stoichiometry, which are often impractical in real-world scenarios due to time and operational constraints. Additionally, these methods are susceptible to modeling uncertainties that can significantly degrade the estimation accuracy, especially when jointly estimating multiple parameters. In this paper, we present a novel reference voltage-based method for robust battery SOH estimation. This method utilizes the voltage response of a battery under a predefined current excitation at the beginning of life (BOL) as a reference to compensate for modeling uncertainty. As the battery degrades, the same excitation is applied to generate the voltage response, which is compared with the BOL trajectory to estimate the key health parameters accurately. The current excitation is optimally designed using the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to maximize the information content of the target parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves parameter estimation accuracy under different degradation levels, compared to conventional methods relying only on direct voltage measurements. Furthermore, our method jointly estimates four key SOH parameters in only 10 minutes, making it practical for real-world battery health diagnostics, e.g., fast testing to enable battery repurposing.</p></details> |  |

However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher.

While concept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based approaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting sampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods rely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which Automatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is built on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free guidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content modification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This inspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the early-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image manifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For single-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map to precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly contribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient erasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile plug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both single and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without compromising the generative fidelity.

This work proposes a flexible language-based framework to adapt generic robotic trajectories produced by off-the-shelf motion planners like RRT, A-star, etc, or learned from human demonstrations. We utilize pre-trained LLMs to adapt trajectory waypoints by generating code as a policy for dense robot manipulation, enabling more complex and flexible instructions than current methods. This approach allows us to incorporate a broader range of commands, including numerical inputs. Compared to state-of-the-art feature-based sequence-to-sequence models which require training, our method does not require task-specific training and offers greater interpretability and more effective feedback mechanisms. We validate our approach through simulation experiments on the robotic manipulator, aerial vehicle, and ground robot in the Pybullet and Gazebo simulation environments, demonstrating that LLMs can successfully adapt trajectories to complex human instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL LangRob workshop 2024</p></details> |

Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into a student generator to achieve one-step generation, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack). DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of the teacher model, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the teacher model's intermediate distributions, and its reverse can be viewed as the convergence trajectory from the student generator to the teacher model. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions along the path to approximate the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance, with FID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 64x64 dataset. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance.

In complex environments, like modern 3D video games, distribution shift and stochasticity necessitate robust approaches beyond simple action replay. In this study, we apply Inverse Dynamics Models (IDM) with different encoders and policy heads to trajectory following in a modern 3D video game -- Bleeding Edge. Additionally, we investigate several future alignment strategies that address the distribution shift caused by the aleatoric uncertainty and imperfections of the agent. We measure both the trajectory deviation distance and the first significant deviation point between the reference and the agent's trajectory and show that the optimal configuration depends on the chosen setting. Our results show that in a diverse data setting, a GPT-style policy head with an encoder trained from scratch performs the best, DINOv2 encoder with the GPT-style policy head gives the best results in the low data regime, and both GPT-style and MLP-style policy heads had comparable results when pre-trained on a diverse setting and fine-tuned for a specific behaviour setting.</p></details> |  |

This overlooks the critical fact that the tires and the surface are the two force-transmitting partners in vehicle dynamics; while the tires stay with the vehicle, surface conditions vary with location. Recognizing these challenges, this paper presents a novel framework for spatially resolving dynamic constraints in both offline and online planning algorithms applied to autonomous racing. We introduce the GripMap concept, which provides a spatial resolution of vehicle dynamic constraints in the Frenet frame, allowing adaptation to locally varying grip conditions. This enables compensation for location-specific effects, more efficient vehicle behavior, and increased safety, unattainable with spatially invariant vehicle models. The focus is on low storage demand and quick access through perfect hashing. This framework proved advantageous in real-world applications in the presented form. Experiments inspired by autonomous racing demonstrate its effectiveness. In future work, this framework can serve as a foundational layer for developing future interpretable learning algorithms that adjust to varying grip conditions in real-time.</p></details> |  |

We propose to analyse facial landmark trajectories, a compact yet informative representation, that encodes these subtle motions from a high-level structural perspective. Hence, we introduce Trajectory-guided Motion Perception Transformer (TraMP-Former), a novel FEQA framework that fuses landmark trajectory features for fine-grained motion capture with visual semantic cues from RGB frames, ultimately regressing the combined features into a quality score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraMP-Former achieves new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with neurological disorders, including PFED5 (up by 6.51%) and an augmented Toronto NeuroFace (up by 7.62%).

Both tasks comprise transductive settings, where the model predicts links among known nodes, and in inductive settings, where it generalises learned patterns to previously unseen nodes. Existing TGN designs face a dilemma under these dual scenarios. Anonymous TGNs, which rely solely on temporal and structural information, offer strong inductive generalisation but struggle to distinguish known nodes. In contrast, non-anonymous TGNs leverage node features to excel in transductive tasks yet fail to adapt to new nodes. To address this challenge, we propose Trajectory Encoding TGN (TETGN). Our approach introduces automatically expandable node identifiers (IDs) as learnable temporal positional features and performs message passing over these IDs to capture each node's historical context. By integrating this trajectory-aware module with a standard TGN using multi-head attention, TETGN effectively balances transductive accuracy with inductive generalisation. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that TETGN significantly outperforms strong baselines on both link prediction and node classification tasks, demonstrating its ability to unify the advantages of anonymous and non-anonymous models for dynamic graph learning.</p></details> |  |

The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Trajectory Embedding for Similarity Computation: When Triangle Inequality Violations in Distance Metrics Matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10933v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity is a cornerstone of trajectory data management and analysis. Traditional similarity functions often suffer from high computational complexity and a reliance on specific distance metrics, prompting a shift towards deep representation learning in Euclidean space. However, existing Euclidean-based trajectory embeddings often face challenges due to the triangle inequality constraints that do not universally hold for trajectory data. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel approach by incorporating non-Euclidean geometry, specifically hyperbolic space, into trajectory representation learning. We present the first-ever integration of hyperbolic space to resolve the inherent limitations of the triangle inequality in Euclidean embeddings. In particular, we achieve it by designing a Lorentz distance measure, which is proven to overcome triangle inequality constraints. Additionally, we design a model-agnostic framework LH-plugin to seamlessly integrate hyperbolic embeddings into existing representation learning pipelines. This includes a novel projection method optimized with the Cosh function to prevent the diminishment of distances, supported by a theoretical foundation. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic fusion distance that intelligently adapts to variations in triangle inequality constraints across different trajectory pairs, blending Lorentzian and Euclidean distances for more robust similarity calculations. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach effectively enhances the accuracy of trajectory similarity measures in state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world datasets. The LH-plugin not only addresses the triangle inequality issues but also significantly refines the precision of trajectory similarity computations, marking a substantial advancement in the field of trajectory representation learning.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

Although predicting the ego-vehicle's path is valuable for driver-assistance systems, existing methods mainly focus on external factors like other vehicles' motions, often neglecting the driver's attention and intent. To address this gap, we infer the ego-trajectory by integrating the driver's gaze and the surrounding scene. We introduce RouteFormer, a novel multimodal ego-trajectory prediction network combining GPS data, environmental context, and the driver's field-of-view, comprising first-person video and gaze fixations. We also present the Path Complexity Index (PCI), a new metric for trajectory complexity that enables a more nuanced evaluation of challenging scenarios. To tackle data scarcity and enhance diversity, we introduce GEM, a comprehensive dataset of urban driving scenarios enriched with synchronized driver field-of-view and gaze data. Extensive evaluations on GEM and DR(eye)VE demonstrate that RouteFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving notable improvements in prediction accuracy across diverse conditions. Ablation studies reveal that incorporating driver field-of-view data yields significantly better average displacement error, especially in challenging scenarios with high PCI scores, underscoring the importance of modeling driver attention.

This paper presents RINGO: Real-time Navigation with a Guiding Trajectory, a novel planning framework that enables aerial manipulators to navigate unknown environments in real time. The proposed method simultaneously considers the positions of both the multi-rotor and the end-effector. A pre-obtained multi-rotor trajectory serves as a guiding reference, allowing the end-effector to generate a smooth, collision-free, and workspace-compatible trajectory. Leveraging the convex hull property of B-spline curves, we theoretically guarantee that the trajectory remains within the reachable workspace. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables real-time navigation of aerial manipulators in unknown environments. The simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method generates less conservative trajectories than approaches that consider only the multi-rotor.</p></details> | 9 pages, 15 figures |

In many real-world scenarios, where data collection is costly and risky, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution by utilizing data collected by domain experts and searching for a batch-constrained optimal policy. This approach is further augmented by incorporating external data sources, expanding the range and diversity of data collection possibilities. However, existing offline RL methods often struggle with challenges posed by non-matching data from these external sources. In this work, we specifically address the problem of source-target domain mismatch in scenarios involving mixed datasets, characterized by a predominance of source data generated from random or suboptimal policies and a limited amount of target data generated from higher-quality policies. To tackle this problem, we introduce Transition Scoring (TS), a novel method that assigns scores to transitions based on their similarity to the target domain, and propose Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation (CLTV), which effectively leverages these transition scores to identify and prioritize high-quality trajectories through a curriculum learning approach. Our extensive experiments across various offline RL methods and MuJoCo environments, complemented by rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrate that CLTV enhances the overall performance and transferability of policies learned by offline RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |

Traditional assessment tools often fail to fully cover course content, leading to imprecise evaluations of student mastery. To tackle this problem, the study proposes a knowledge graph construction method based on large language models (LLMs), which transforms learning materials into structured data and generates personalized learning trajectory graphs by analyzing students' test data. Experimental results demonstrate that the model effectively alerts teachers to potential biases in their exam questions and tracks individual student progress. This system not only enhances the accuracy of learning assessments but also helps teachers provide timely guidance to students who are falling behind, thereby improving overall teaching strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Slit Mapping Based Spiral Tool Trajectory Planning for Ball-end Milling on Complex Freeform Surfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06310v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a spiral-based complete coverage strategy for ball-end milling on freeform surfaces, utilizing conformal slit mapping to generate milling trajectories that are more compact, smoother, and evenly distributed when machining 2D cavities with islands. This approach, an upgrade from traditional methods, extends the original algorithm to effectively address 3D perforated surface milling. Unlike conventional algorithms, the method embeds a continuous spiral trajectory within perforated surfaces without requiring cellular decomposition or additional boundaries. The proposed method addresses three primary challenges, including modifying conformal slit mapping for mesh surfaces, maintaining uniform scallop height between adjacent spiral trajectories, and optimizing the mapped origin point to ensure uniform scallop height distribution. To overcome these challenges, surface flattening techniques are incorporated into the original approach to accommodate mesh surfaces effectively. Tool path spacing is then optimized using a binary search strategy to regulate scallop height. A functional energy metric associated with scallop height uniformity is introduced for rapid evaluation of points mapped to the origin, with the minimum functional energy determined through perturbation techniques. The optimal placement of this point is identified using a modified gradient descent approach applied to the energy function. Validation on intricate surfaces, including low-quality and high-genus meshes, verifies the robustness of the algorithm. Surface milling experiments comparing this method with conventional techniques indicate a 15.63% improvement in scallop height uniformity while reducing machining time, average spindle impact, and spindle impact variance by up to 7.36%, 27.79%, and 55.98%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The r...</summary><p>The revised manuscript has improved the quality of the figures</p></details> |
| **[IMPACT: Behavioral Intention-aware Multimodal Trajectory Prediction with Adaptive Context Trimming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09103v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most prior research has focused on improving the precision of multimodal trajectory predictions, the explicit modeling of multimodal behavioral intentions (e.g., yielding, overtaking) remains relatively underexplored. This paper proposes a unified framework that jointly predicts both behavioral intentions and trajectories to enhance prediction accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. Specifically, we employ a shared context encoder for both intention and trajectory predictions, thereby reducing structural redundancy and information loss. Moreover, we address the lack of ground-truth behavioral intention labels in mainstream datasets (Waymo, Argoverse) by auto-labeling these datasets, thus advancing the community's efforts in this direction. We further introduce a vectorized occupancy prediction module that infers the probability of each map polyline being occupied by the target vehicle's future trajectory. By leveraging these intention and occupancy prediction priors, our method conducts dynamic, modality-dependent pruning of irrelevant agents and map polylines in the decoding stage, effectively reducing computational overhead and mitigating noise from non-critical elements. Our approach ranks first among LiDAR-free methods on the Waymo Motion Dataset and achieves first place on the Waymo Interactive Prediction Dataset. Remarkably, even without model ensembling, our single-model framework improves the soft mean average precision (softmAP) by 10 percent compared to the second-best method in the Waymo Interactive Prediction Leaderboard. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been successfully deployed on real vehicles, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | under review |

In this paper, we propose a novel method for trajectory synthesis by adapting the Time-Based Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (TimeVQVAE). Our approach leverages time-frequency domain processing, vector quantization, and transformer-based priors to capture both global and local dynamics in flight data. By discretizing the latent space and integrating transformer priors, the model learns long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and preserves coherence across entire flight paths. We evaluate the adapted TimeVQVAE using an extensive suite of quality, statistical, and distributional metrics, as well as a flyability assessment conducted in an open-source air traffic simulator. Results indicate that TimeVQVAE outperforms a temporal convolutional VAE baseline, generating synthetic trajectories that mirror real flight data in terms of spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and statistical properties. Furthermore, the simulator-based assessment shows that most generated trajectories maintain operational feasibility, although occasional outliers underscore the potential need for additional domain-specific constraints. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of multi-scale representation learning for capturing complex flight behaviors and demonstrate the promise of TimeVQVAE in producing representative synthetic trajectories for downstream tasks such as model training, airspace design, and air traffic forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was presented at the 25th Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS 2025), April 8--10, 2025, Brussels, Belgium</p></details> |
| **[AgentRewardBench: Evaluating Automatic Evaluations of Web Agent Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08942v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web agents enable users to perform tasks on web browsers through natural language interaction. Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations. We release the benchmark at: https://agent-reward-bench.github.io</p></details> |  |

In This paper, an adaptive transpose Jacobian approach is proposed to deal with the dynamic model complexity, which utilizes an adaptive PI-algorithm to adjust the control gains. The performance of the proposed control algorithm is compared with the conventional transpose Jacobian and sliding mode control algorithms and evaluated by the root mean square of the errors and control input energy criteria. In order to appraise the effectiveness of the proposed control system, simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink software for a quadruped robot leg for semi-elliptical path tracking. The obtained results show that the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian reduces the overshoot and root mean square of the errors and at the same time, decreases the control input energy. Moreover, transpose Jacobin and adaptive transpose Jacobian are more robust to changes in initial conditions compared to the conventional sliding mode control. Furthermore, sliding mode control performs well up to 20% uncertainties in the parameters due to its model-based nature, whereas the transpose Jacobin and the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian algorithms show promising results even in higher mass uncertainties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Xplore</p></details> |
| **[On trajectory design from motion primitives for near time-optimal transitions for systems with oscillating internal dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19144v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An efficient approach to compute near time-optimal trajectories for linear kinematic systems with oscillatory internal dynamics is presented. Thereby, kinematic constraints with respect to velocity, acceleration and jerk are taken into account. The trajectories are composed of several motion primitives, the most crucial of which is termed jerk segment. Within this contribution, the focus is put on the composition of the overall trajectories, assuming the required motion primitives to be readily available. Since the scheme considered is not time-optimal, even decreasing particular constraints can reduce the overall transition time, which is analysed in detail. This observation implies that replanning of the underlying jerk segments is required as an integral part of the motion planning scheme, further insight into which has been analysed in a complementary contribution. Although the proposed scheme is not time-optimal, it allows for significantly shorter transition times than established methods, such as zero-vibration shaping, while requiring significantly lower computational power than a fully time-optimal scheme.</p></details> |  |

The proposed filter, the trajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the set of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the set of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated with the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM posterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM density on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution for multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating the set of target states at the end of each time window. Additionally, the paper proposes computationally lighter alternatives to the TM-PMBM filter by deriving a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) density through Kullback-Leibler divergence minimisation in an augmented space with auxiliary variables. The performance of the proposed filters are evaluated in a simulation study.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, journal paper</p></details> |

Moreover, incorporating prior information input into such perception model represents an effective approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy. However, utilizing diverse sources of prior information still faces three key challenges: the acquisition of high-quality prior information, alignment between prior and online perception, efficient integration. To address these issues, we investigate prior augmentation from a novel perspective of trajectory priors. In this paper, we initially extract crowdsourcing trajectory data from Argoverse2 motion forecasting dataset and encode trajectory data into rasterized heatmap and vectorized instance tokens, then we incorporate such prior information into the online mapping model through different ways. Besides, with the purpose of mitigating the misalignment between prior and online perception, we design a confidence-based fusion module that takes alignment into account during the fusion process. We conduct extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 dataset. The results indicate that our method's performance significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Adaptive Shrinkage Estimation For Personalized Deep Kernel Regression In Modeling Brain Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08840v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Longitudinal biomedical studies monitor individuals over time to capture dynamics in brain development, disease progression, and treatment effects. However, estimating trajectories of brain biomarkers is challenging due to biological variability, inconsistencies in measurement protocols (e.g., differences in MRI scanners), scarcity, and irregularity in longitudinal measurements. Herein, we introduce a novel personalized deep kernel regression framework for forecasting brain biomarkers, with application to regional volumetric measurements. Our approach integrates two key components: a population model that captures brain trajectories from a large and diverse cohort, and a subject-specific model that captures individual trajectories. To optimally combine these, we propose Adaptive Shrinkage Estimation, which effectively balances population and subject-specific models. We assess our model's performance through predictive accuracy metrics, uncertainty quantification, and validation against external clinical studies. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models -- including linear mixed effects models, generalized additive models, and deep learning methods -- demonstrates the superior predictive performance of our approach. Additionally, we apply our method to predict trajectories of composite neuroimaging biomarkers, which highlights the versatility of our approach in modeling the progression of longitudinal neuroimaging biomarkers. Furthermore, validation on three external neuroimaging studies confirms the robustness of our method across different clinical contexts. We make the code available at https://github.com/vatass/AdaptiveShrinkageDKGP.</p></details> |  |

In cinematography, Directors of Photography meticulously craft camera movements to achieve expressive and intentional framing. However, existing methods for camera trajectory generation remain limited: Traditional approaches rely on geometric optimization or handcrafted procedural systems, while recent learning-based methods often inherit structural biases or lack textual alignment, constraining creative synthesis. In this work, we introduce an auto-regressive model inspired by the expertise of Directors of Photography to generate artistic and expressive camera trajectories. We first introduce DataDoP, a large-scale multi-modal dataset containing 29K real-world shots with free-moving camera trajectories, depth maps, and detailed captions in specific movements, interaction with the scene, and directorial intent. Thanks to the comprehensive and diverse database, we further train an auto-regressive, decoder-only Transformer for high-quality, context-aware camera movement generation based on text guidance and RGBD inputs, named GenDoP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to existing methods, GenDoP offers better controllability, finer-grained trajectory adjustments, and higher motion stability. We believe our approach establishes a new standard for learning-based cinematography, paving the way for future advancements in camera control and filmmaking.

Traditional approaches often rely on static snapshots of network states, which can obscure the underlying dynamics of opinion evolution. In this study, we introduce a dynamic framework that quantifies the unpredictability of opinion trajectories using the normalized Lempel-Ziv (nLZ) complexity. Our approach leverages an adaptive social network model where each node is characterized by three behavioral parameters - homophily, neophily, and social conformity - and where opinions evolve continuously according to a system of ordinary differential equations. The results reveal distinct nLZ complexity signatures for each node type: homophilic nodes exhibit consistently rising complexity, reflecting increasingly unpredictable opinion shifts that are counterintuitive given their tendency for similarity; neophilic nodes maintain low and stable complexity, suggesting that openness to novelty can, surprisingly, lead to stable opinion dynamics; and conformic nodes display a U-shaped complexity trend, transitioning from early opinion stagnation to later unpredictability. In fully heterogeneous networks, modest interaction effects emerge, with slight shifts in the unpredictability of each faction's trajectories. These findings underscore the importance of temporal analysis in uncovering hidden dynamical patterns, offering novel insights into the mechanisms underlying social adaptation and polarization.</p></details> |  |

Typically such approaches operate by computing $\tilde{N}$ perturbed rollouts around the nominal dynamics to estimate the collision risk associated with a sequence of control commands. We consider a setting where it is expensive to estimate risk using perturbed rollouts, for example, due to expensive collision-checks. We put forward two key contributions. First, we develop an algorithm that distills the statistical information from a larger set of rollouts to a reduced-set with sample size $N<<\tilde{N}$. Consequently, we estimate collision risk using just $N$ rollouts instead of $\tilde{N}$. Second, we formulate a novel surrogate for the collision risk that can leverage the distilled statistical information contained in the reduced-set. We formalize both algorithmic contributions using distribution embedding in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We perform extensive benchmarking to demonstrate that our MMD-based approach leads to safer trajectories at low sample regime than existing baselines using Conditional Value-at Risk (CVaR) based collision risk estimate.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Basant1861/MPC-MMD</p></details> |

The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Novel Diffusion Models for Multimodal 3D Hand Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07375v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting hand motion is critical for understanding human intentions and bridging the action space between human movements and robot manipulations. Existing hand trajectory prediction (HTP) methods forecast the future hand waypoints in 3D space conditioned on past egocentric observations. However, such models are only designed to accommodate 2D egocentric video inputs. There is a lack of awareness of multimodal environmental information from both 2D and 3D observations, hindering the further improvement of 3D HTP performance. In addition, these models overlook the synergy between hand movements and headset camera egomotion, either predicting hand trajectories in isolation or encoding egomotion only from past frames. To address these limitations, we propose novel diffusion models (MMTwin) for multimodal 3D hand trajectory prediction. MMTwin is designed to absorb multimodal information as input encompassing 2D RGB images, 3D point clouds, past hand waypoints, and text prompt. Besides, two latent diffusion models, the egomotion diffusion and the HTP diffusion as twins, are integrated into MMTwin to predict camera egomotion and future hand trajectories concurrently. We propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer module as the denoising model of the HTP diffusion to better fuse multimodal features. The experimental results on three publicly available datasets and our self-recorded data demonstrate that our proposed MMTwin can predict plausible future 3D hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and generalizes well to unseen environments. The code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/MMTwin.</p></details> |  |

It performs optimal controls by directly harnessing input-output (I/O) data, bypassing the process of explicit model identification that can be costly and time-consuming. However, its high computational complexity, driven by a large-scale optimization problem (typically in a higher dimension than its model-based counterpart--Model Predictive Control), hinders real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose the data-enabled neighboring extremal (DeeNE) framework, which significantly reduces computational cost while preserving control performance. DeeNE leverages first-order optimality perturbation analysis to efficiently update a precomputed nominal DeePC solution in response to changes in initial conditions and reference trajectories. We validate its effectiveness on a 7-DoF KINOVA Gen3 robotic arm, demonstrating substantial computational savings and robust, data-driven control performance.</p></details> |  |

Current methods in this space require specific architectural changes to image generation models, which limit their adaptability and scalability. In contrast to such methods, we provide a model-agnostic approach. We use intersections in diffusion trajectories, working only with the latent values. We could not obtain localized frame-wise coherence and diversity using only the intersection of trajectories. Thus, we instead use a grid-based approach. An in-context trained LLM is used to generate coherent frame-wise prompts; another is used to identify differences between frames. Based on these, we obtain a CLIP-based attention mask that controls the timing of switching the prompts for each grid cell. Earlier switching results in higher variance, while later switching results in more coherence. Therefore, our approach can ensure appropriate control between coherence and variance for the frames. Our approach results in state-of-the-art performance while being more flexible when working with diverse image-generation models. The empirical analysis using quantitative metrics and user studies confirms our model's superior temporal consistency, visual fidelity and user satisfaction, thus providing a novel way to obtain training-free, image-based text-to-video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> |

Yet, to fully realize its potential, an effective online trajectory evaluation is indispensable to ensure safety. By forecasting the future outcomes of a given trajectory, trajectory evaluation becomes much more effective. This goal can be achieved by employing a world model to capture environmental dynamics and predict future states. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end driving framework WoTE, which leverages a BEV World model to predict future BEV states for Trajectory Evaluation. The proposed BEV world model is latency-efficient compared to image-level world models and can be seamlessly supervised using off-the-shelf BEV-space traffic simulators.

However, open-loop training on the nuPlan dataset tends to cause causal confusion during closed-loop testing, and the dataset also presents a long-tail distribution of scenarios. These issues introduce challenges for imitation learning. To tackle these problems, we introduce CAFE-AD, a Cross-Scenario Adaptive Feature Enhancement for Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving method, designed to enhance feature representation across various scenario types. We develop an adaptive feature pruning module that ranks feature importance to capture the most relevant information while reducing the interference of noisy information during training. Moreover, we propose a cross-scenario feature interpolation module that enhances scenario information to introduce diversity, enabling the network to alleviate over-fitting in dominant scenarios. We evaluate our method CAFE-AD on the challenging public nuPlan Test14-Hard closed-loop simulation benchmark. The results demonstrate that CAFE-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods including rule-based and hybrid planners, and exhibits the potential in mitigating the impact of long-tail distribution within the dataset. Additionally, we further validate its effectiveness in real-world environments.

The optimization process yields an optimal control sequence that depends on the initial conditions and system parameters. However, the optimal sequence may result in undesirable behavior if the system's initial conditions and parameters are erroneous. This work presents a data-driven fuzzy controller synthesis framework that is guided by a time-optimal trajectory for multicopter tracking problems. In particular, we consider an aggressive maneuver consisting of a mid-air flip and generate a time-optimal trajectory by numerically solving the two-point boundary value problem.

Specifically, the UAV's kinematic and camera control inputs are jointly optimized over a rolling planning horizon to achieve complete 3D coverage of the object. The proposed controller incorporates ray-tracing into the planning process to simulate the propagation of light rays, thereby determining the visible parts of the object through the UAV's camera. This integration enables the generation of precise look-ahead coverage trajectories. The coverage planning problem is formulated as a rolling finite-horizon optimal control problem and solved using mixed-integer programming techniques. Extensive real-world and synthetic experiments validate the performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

Aiming at this issue, this paper investigates a differential flatness-based trajectory optimization method for fixed-wing UAVs (DFTO-FW). The customized trajectory representation is presented through differential flat characteristics analysis and polynomial parameterization, eliminating equality constraints to avoid the heavy computational burdens of solving complex dynamics. Through the design of integral performance costs and derivation of analytical gradients, the original trajectory optimization is transcribed into a lightweight, unconstrained, gradient-analytical optimization with linear time complexity to improve efficiency further. The simulation experiments illustrate the superior efficiency of the DFTO-FW, which takes sub-second CPU time (on a personal desktop) against other competitors by orders of magnitude to generate fixed-wing UAV trajectories in randomly generated obstacle environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version with minor language and formatting edits.

The proposed method is measurement-based and decomposes the voltage trajectory into two key components using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD): a residual part, which indicates delayed voltage recovery, and an oscillatory part, which captures oscillations. The residual component is critical, as it can detect activation of OELs in synchronous generators or Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) relays in inverter-based resources, potentially leading to instability within the quasisteady-state time frame. Meanwhile, the oscillatory component may indicate either a stable or unstable state in the short term. To accurately assess stability, STVSI employs an entropy-based metric to measure the proximity of the system to instability, with specific indices for short-term voltage stability based on oscillations and recovery. Simulations on the Nordic power system demonstrate that STVSI effectively identifies and categorizes voltage stability issues. Moreover, STVSI not only detects voltage stability conditions but also qualitatively assesses the extent of stability, providing a nuanced measure of stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted for publication in IEEE PESGM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Vision-Language Model Predictive Control for Manipulation Planning and Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05225v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a widely adopted control paradigm that leverages predictive models to estimate future system states and optimize control inputs accordingly. However, while MPC excels in planning and control, it lacks the capability for environmental perception, leading to failures in complex and unstructured scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce Vision-Language Model Predictive Control (VLMPC), a robotic manipulation planning framework that integrates the perception power of vision-language models (VLMs) with MPC. VLMPC utilizes a conditional action sampling module that takes a goal image or language instruction as input and leverages VLM to generate candidate action sequences. These candidates are fed into a video prediction model that simulates future frames based on the actions. In addition, we propose an enhanced variant, Traj-VLMPC, which replaces video prediction with motion trajectory generation to reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. Traj-VLMPC estimates motion dynamics conditioned on the candidate actions, offering a more efficient alternative for long-horizon tasks and real-time applications. Both VLMPC and Traj-VLMPC select the optimal action sequence using a VLM-based hierarchical cost function that captures both pixel-level and knowledge-level consistency between the current observation and the task input. We demonstrate that both approaches outperform existing state-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks and achieve excellent performance in various real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Despite recent advancements in place recognition using 2D cameras or 3D LiDAR, it remains to be seen how to use 4D radar for place recognition - an increasingly popular sensor for its robustness against adverse weather and lighting conditions. Compared to LiDAR point clouds, radar data are drastically sparser, noisier and in much lower resolution, which hampers their ability to effectively represent scenes, posing significant challenges for 4D radar-based place recognition. This work addresses these challenges by leveraging multi-modal information from sequential 4D radar scans and effectively extracting and aggregating spatio-temporal features.Our approach follows a principled pipeline that comprises (1) dynamic points removal and ego-velocity estimation from velocity property, (2) bird's eye view (BEV) feature encoding on the refined point cloud, (3) feature alignment using BEV feature map motion trajectory calculated by ego-velocity, (4) multi-scale spatio-temporal features of the aligned BEV feature maps are extracted and aggregated.Real-world experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed method and demonstrate its robustness in handling dynamic environments.

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging an intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.</p></details> |  |

Simultaneous control and trajectory estimation using probabilistic graphical models has been proposed as a unified solution to these challenges. Previous work, however, relies heavily on appropriate Gaussian priors and is limited to holonomic robots with linear time-varying models. The current research extends graphical optimization methods to vehicles with arbitrary dynamical models via Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation and Local Adaptation (STELA). The overall approach initializes feasible trajectories using a kinodynamic, sampling-based motion planner. Then, it simultaneously: (i) estimates the past trajectory based on noisy observations, and (ii) adapts the controls to be executed to minimize deviations from the planned, feasible trajectory, while avoiding collisions. The proposed factor graph representation of trajectories in STELA can be applied for any dynamical system given access to first or second-order state update equations, and introduces the duration of execution between two states in the trajectory discretization as an optimization variable. These features provide both generalization and flexibility in trajectory following. In addition to targeting computational efficiency, the proposed strategy performs incremental updates of the factor graph using the iSAM algorithm and introduces a time-window mechanism. This mechanism allows the factor graph to be dynamically updated to operate over a limited history and forward horizon of the planned trajectory. This enables online updates of controls at a minimum of 10Hz. Experiments demonstrate that STELA achieves at least comparable performance to previous frameworks on idealized vehicles with linear dynamics.[...]</p></details> | [Accepted] RSS 2025 |

While, the spin is not directly observable in standard broadcasting videos, we show that it can be inferred from the ball's trajectory in the video. We present a novel method to infer the initial spin and 3D trajectory from the corresponding 2D trajectory in a video. Without ground truth labels for broadcast videos, we train a neural network solely on synthetic data. Due to the choice of our input data representation, physically correct synthetic training data, and using targeted augmentations, the network naturally generalizes to real data. Notably, these simple techniques are sufficient to achieve generalization. No real data at all is required for training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a method for spin and trajectory prediction in simple monocular broadcast videos, achieving an accuracy of 92.0% in spin classification and a 2D reprojection error of 0.19% of the image diagonal.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)</p></details> |

However, existing methods face robotic hardware dependency and control frequency mismatches between teleoperation devices and robotic platforms. Our approach automatically extracts kinematic parameters from unified robot description format (URDF) files, and enables pluggable deployment across diverse robots through uniform interfaces. The proposed interpolation algorithm bridges the frequency gap between low-rate human inputs and high-frequency robotic control commands through online continuous trajectory generation, \n{while requiring no access to the closed, bottom-level control loop}. To enhance trajectory smoothness, we introduce a minimum-stretch spline that optimizes the motion quality. The system further provides precision and rapid modes to accommodate different task requirements. Experiments across various robotic platforms including dual-arm ones demonstrate generality and smooth operation performance of our methods. The code is developed in C++ with python interface, and available at https://github.com/IRMV-Manipulation-Group/UTTG.</p></details> |  |

Existing deep generative models learn from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with increasing data size. More importantly, they often lack control mechanisms to guide the generated trajectories under constraints such as enforcing specific visits. To address these limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem for effectively handling multiple spatiotemporal constraints. We introduce Geo-Llama, a novel LLM finetuning framework that can enforce multiple explicit visit constraints while maintaining contextual coherence of the generated trajectories. In this approach, pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned on trajectory data with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a specific time and location. This strategy enables the model to capture spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders while maintaining flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional modular methods suffer from error propagation, while existing end-to-end models typically employ static one-shot inference paradigms that inadequately capture the dynamic changes of the environment. ARTEMIS takes a different method by generating trajectory waypoints sequentially, preserves critical temporal dependencies while dynamically routing scene-specific queries to specialized expert networks. It effectively relieves trajectory quality degradation issues encountered when guidance information is ambiguous, and overcomes the inherent representational limitations of singular network architectures when processing diverse driving scenarios. Additionally, we use a lightweight batch reallocation strategy that significantly improves the training speed of the Mixture-of-Experts model. Through experiments on the NAVSIM dataset, ARTEMIS exhibits superior competitive performance, achieving 87.0 PDMS and 83.1 EPDMS with ResNet-34 backbone, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this, an end-to-end foot trajectory and force optimization framework (FTFOF) is proposed, which optimizes foot adhesion and detachment forces through trajectory adjustments. This framework accepts general foot trajectory constraints and user-defined parameters as input, ultimately producing an optimal single foot trajectory. It integrates three-segment $C^2$ continuous Bezier curves, tailored to various foot structures, enabling the generation of effective climbing trajectories. A dilate-based GRU predictive model establishes the relationship between foot trajectories and the corresponding foot forces. Multi-objective optimization algorithms, combined with a redundancy hierarchical strategy, identify the most suitable foot trajectory for specific tasks, thereby ensuring optimal performance across detachment force, adhesion force and vibration amplitude. Experimental validation on the quadruped climbing robot MST-M3F showed that, compared to commonly used trajectories in existing legged climbing robots, the proposed framework achieved reductions in maximum detachment force by 28 \%, vibration amplitude by 82 \%, which ensures the stable climbing of dry adhesion legged climbing robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning with Model Predictive Control for Obstacle Avoidance Considering Prediction Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19193v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel trajectory planner for autonomous robots, specifically designed to enhance navigation by incorporating dynamic obstacle avoidance within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) and Navigation 2 (Nav2) framework. The proposed method utilizes Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a focus on handling the uncertainties associated with the movement prediction of dynamic obstacles. Unlike existing Nav2 trajectory planners which primarily deal with static obstacles or react to the current position of dynamic obstacles, this planner predicts future obstacle positions using a stochastic Vector Auto-Regressive Model (VAR). The obstacles' future positions are represented by probability distributions, and collision avoidance is achieved through constraints based on the Mahalanobis distance, ensuring the robot avoids regions where obstacles are likely to be. This approach considers the robot's kinodynamic constraints, enabling it to track a reference path while adapting to real-time changes in the environment. The paper details the implementation, including obstacle prediction, tracking, and the construction of feasible sets for MPC. Simulation results in a Gazebo environment demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in scenarios where robots must navigate around each other, showing improved collision avoidance capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to IFAC for publication under a Creative Commons Licence CC-BY-NC-ND</p></details> |

Therefore, fin-driven autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can achieve high maneuverability with a smaller number of actuators, but their control is challenging. This study proposes an analytic control allocation method for underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). By integrating an adaptive hybrid feedback controller, we enable an AUV with 4 actuators to move in 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) in simulation and up to 5-DOF in real-world experiments. The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art control allocation techniques in 6-DOF trajectory tracking simulations, exhibiting centimeter-scale accuracy and higher energy and computational efficiency. Real-world pool experiments confirmed the method's robustness and efficacy in tracking complex 3D trajectories, with significant computational efficiency gains 0.007 (ms) vs. 22.28 (ms). Our method offers a balance between performance, energy efficiency, and computational efficiency, showcasing a potential avenue for more effective tracking of a large number of DOF for under-actuated underwater robots.</p></details> |  |

These seek to answer a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in stochastic thermodynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 appendices (10 pages), 4 figures; https://csc.ucdavis.edu/~cmg/compmech/pubs/currents.htm</p></details> |
| **[DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> |  |

Critical to these improvements is understanding AVs' longitudinal behavior, relying heavily on real-world trajectory data. Existing open-source trajectory datasets of AV, however, often fall short in refinement, reliability, and completeness, hindering effective performance metrics analysis and model development. This study addresses these challenges by creating a Unified Longitudinal TRAjectory dataset for AVs (Ultra-AV) to analyze their microscopic longitudinal driving behaviors. This dataset compiles data from 13 distinct sources, encompassing various AV types, test sites, and experiment scenarios. We established a three-step data processing: 1. extraction of longitudinal trajectory data, 2. general data cleaning, and 3. data-specific cleaning to obtain the longitudinal trajectory data and car-following trajectory data. The validity of the processed data is affirmed through performance evaluations across safety, mobility, stability, and sustainability, along with an analysis of the relationships between variables in car-following models. Our work not only furnishes researchers with standardized data and metrics for longitudinal AV behavior studies but also sets guidelines for data collection and model development.</p></details> | NA |

While these methods achieve exceptional performance in defined datasets, they usually rely on the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption and thus tend to be vulnerable to distribution shifts that occur in the real world. In addition, these methods lack explainability due to their black box nature, which poses further challenges in terms of the approval process and social trustworthiness. Therefore, in order to use the capabilities of data-driven statistical AI methods in a reliable and trustworthy manner, the concept of TrustMHE is introduced and investigated in this paper. TrustMHE represents a complementary approach, independent of the underlying AI systems, that combines AI-driven out-of-distribution detection with control-driven moving horizon estimation (MHE) to enable not only detection and monitoring, but also intervention. The effectiveness of the proposed TrustMHE is evaluated and proven in three simulation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), JCluj-Napoca, Romania, June 22-25, 2025</p></details> |

While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Reupl...</summary><p>Reuploaded with new version-- equation 16 was incorrect</p></details> |

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel mixed Bernstein-Fourier approximation framework tailored explicitly for optimal motion planning. Our proposed methodology leverages the uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials for nonperiodic behaviors while effectively capturing periodic dynamics through Fourier series. Theoretical results are established, including uniform convergence proofs for approximations of functions, derivatives, and integrals, as well as detailed error bound analyses. We further introduce a regulated least squares approach for determining approximation coefficients, enhancing numerical stability and practical applicability. Within an optimal control context, we establish feasibility and consistency of approximated solutions to their continuous counterparts. We also extend the covector mapping theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for approximating dual variables crucial in verifying the necessary optimality conditions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Comprehensive numerical examples illustrate the method's superior performance, demonstrating substantial improvements in computational efficiency and precision in scenarios with complex periodic constraints and dynamics. Our mixed Bernstein-Fourier methodology thus presents a robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient approach for advanced optimal trajectory planning in autonomous systems.</p></details> | 49 pages, 9 figures |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets. The official implementation is available at https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/ImageFlowNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2025, Oral Presentation</p></details> |

Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions. Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories. We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 30 figures, Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

There is a urgent need to minimize the data size in LLM training. Compared with data selection method, the data distillation method aims to synthesize a small number of data samples to achieve the training effect of the full data set and has better flexibility. Despite its successes in computer vision, the discreteness of text data has hitherto stymied its exploration in natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we proposed a method that involves learning pseudo prompt data based on trajectory matching and finding its nearest neighbor ID to achieve cross-architecture transfer. During the distillation process, we introduce a regularization loss to improve the robustness of our distilled data. To our best knowledge, this is the first data distillation work suitable for text generation tasks such as instruction tuning. Evaluations on two benchmarks, including ARC-Easy and MMLU instruction tuning datasets, established the superiority of our distillation approach over the SOTA data selection method LESS. Furthermore, our method demonstrates a good transferability over LLM structures (i.e., OPT to Llama).</p></details> |  |

Our framework begins by generating panoptic occupancy local semantic maps and accurate localization information from data aligned between a monocular camera, IMU, and GPS. This information is combined with input terrain point clouds or preloaded terrain information to initialize the planning process. We propose the Radiant Field-Informed Coverage Planning algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion field model to dynamically adjust the robot's coverage trajectory and speed based on environmental attributes such as dirtiness and dryness. By modeling the spatial influence of the robot's actions using a Gaussian field, ensures a speed-optimized, uniform coverage trajectory while adapting to varying environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building Real-time Awareness of Out-of-distribution in Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17277v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is essential for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles in real-world environments. Even well-trained machine learning models may produce unreliable predictions due to discrepancies between training data and real-world conditions encountered during inference. In particular, the training dataset tends to overrepresent common scenes (e.g., straight lanes) while underrepresenting less frequent ones (e.g., traffic circles). In addition, it often overlooks unpredictable real-world events such as sudden braking or falling objects. To ensure safety, it is critical to detect in real-time when a model's predictions become unreliable. Leveraging the intuition that in-distribution (ID) scenes exhibit error patterns similar to training data, while out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes do not, we introduce a principled, real-time approach for OOD detection by framing it as a change-point detection problem. We address the challenging settings where the OOD scenes are deceptive, meaning that they are not easily detectable by human intuitions. Our lightweight solutions can handle the occurrence of OOD at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraCeS: Trajectory Based Credit Assignment From Sparse Safety Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12557v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In safe reinforcement learning (RL), auxiliary safety costs are used to align the agent to safe decision making. In practice, safety constraints, including cost functions and budgets, are unknown or hard to specify, as it requires anticipation of all possible unsafe behaviors. We therefore address a general setting where the true safety definition is unknown, and has to be learned from sparsely labeled data. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety model that performs credit assignment to estimate each decision step's impact on the overall safety using a dataset of diverse trajectories and their corresponding binary safety labels (i.e., whether the corresponding trajectory is safe/unsafe). Second, we illustrate the architecture of our safety model to demonstrate its ability to learn a separate safety score for each timestep. Third, we reformulate the safe RL problem using the proposed safety model and derive an effective algorithm to optimize a safe yet rewarding policy. Finally, our empirical results corroborate our findings and show that this approach is effective in satisfying unknown safety definition, and scalable to various continuous control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SILM: A Subjective Intent Based Low-Latency Framework for Multiple Traffic Participants Joint Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16377v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a fundamental technology for advanced autonomous driving systems and represents one of the most challenging problems in the field of cognitive intelligence. Accurately predicting the future trajectories of each traffic participant is a prerequisite for building high safety and high reliability decision-making, planning, and control capabilities in autonomous driving. However, existing methods often focus solely on the motion of other traffic participants without considering the underlying intent behind that motion, which increases the uncertainty in trajectory prediction. Autonomous vehicles operate in real-time environments, meaning that trajectory prediction algorithms must be able to process data and generate predictions in real-time. While many existing methods achieve high accuracy, they often struggle to effectively handle heterogeneous traffic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Subjective Intent-based Low-latency framework for Multiple traffic participants joint trajectory prediction. Our method explicitly incorporates the subjective intent of traffic participants based on their key points, and predicts the future trajectories jointly without map, which ensures promising performance while significantly reducing the prediction latency. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset designed specifically for trajectory prediction. Related code and dataset will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

As this is a novel task, there is currently no relevant dataset available in the community. To address this gap, we first devised a new visualization language called Trajectory Visualization Language (TVL) to facilitate querying trajectory data and generating visualizations. Building on this foundation, we further proposed a dataset construction method that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with human efforts to create high-quality data. Specifically, we first generate TVLs using a comprehensive and systematic process, and then label each TVL with corresponding natural language questions using LLMs. This process results in the creation of the first large-scale Text-to-TrajVis dataset, named TrajVL, which contains 18,140 (question, TVL) pairs. Based on this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of multiple LLMs (GPT, Qwen, Llama, etc.) on this task. The experimental results demonstrate that this task is both feasible and highly challenging and merits further exploration within the research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[DriVerse: Navigation World Model for Driving Simulation via Multimodal Trajectory Prompting and Motion Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18576v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents DriVerse, a generative model for simulating navigation-driven driving scenes from a single image and a future trajectory. Previous autonomous driving world models either directly feed the trajectory or discrete control signals into the generation pipeline, leading to poor alignment between the control inputs and the implicit features of the 2D base generative model, which results in low-fidelity video outputs. Some methods use coarse textual commands or discrete vehicle control signals, which lack the precision to guide fine-grained, trajectory-specific video generation, making them unsuitable for evaluating actual autonomous driving algorithms. DriVerse introduces explicit trajectory guidance in two complementary forms: it tokenizes trajectories into textual prompts using a predefined trend vocabulary for seamless language integration, and converts 3D trajectories into 2D spatial motion priors to enhance control over static content within the driving scene. To better handle dynamic objects, we further introduce a lightweight motion alignment module, which focuses on the inter-frame consistency of dynamic pixels, significantly enhancing the temporal coherence of moving elements over long sequences. With minimal training and no need for additional data, DriVerse outperforms specialized models on future video generation tasks across both the nuScenes and Waymo datasets. The code and models will be released to the public.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Dynamic Intent Queries for Motion Transformer-based Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15766v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, accurately predicting the movements of other traffic participants is crucial, as it significantly influences a vehicle's planning processes. Modern trajectory prediction models strive to interpret complex patterns and dependencies from agent and map data. The Motion Transformer (MTR) architecture and subsequent work define the most accurate methods in common benchmarks such as the Waymo Open Motion Benchmark. The MTR model employs pre-generated static intention points as initial goal points for trajectory prediction. However, the static nature of these points frequently leads to misalignment with map data in specific traffic scenarios, resulting in unfeasible or unrealistic goal points. Our research addresses this limitation by integrating scene-specific dynamic intention points into the MTR model. This adaptation of the MTR model was trained and evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating dynamic intention points has a significant positive impact on trajectory prediction accuracy, especially for predictions over long time horizons. Furthermore, we analyze the impact on ground truth trajectories which are not compliant with the map data or are illegal maneuvers.</p></details> |  |
| **[SocialMOIF: Multi-Order Intention Fusion for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15616v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The analysis and prediction of agent trajectories are crucial for decision-making processes in intelligent systems, with precise short-term trajectory forecasting being highly significant across a range of applications. Agents and their social interactions have been quantified and modeled by researchers from various perspectives; however, substantial limitations exist in the current work due to the inherent high uncertainty of agent intentions and the complex higher-order influences among neighboring groups. SocialMOIF is proposed to tackle these challenges, concentrating on the higher-order intention interactions among neighboring groups while reinforcing the primary role of first-order intention interactions between neighbors and the target agent. This method develops a multi-order intention fusion model to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of both direct and indirect intention information. Within SocialMOIF, a trajectory distribution approximator is designed to guide the trajectories toward values that align more closely with the actual data, thereby enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, a global trajectory optimizer is introduced to enable more accurate and efficient parallel predictions. By incorporating a novel loss function that accounts for distance and direction during training, experimental results demonstrate that the model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics in both dynamic and static datasets.</p></details> | 11 pages,6 figures |
| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v5)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025.

Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. Visuomotor policies enhanced by DiffOG generate smoother, constraint-compliant action trajectories in a more interpretable way. DiffOG exhibits strong generalization capabilities and high flexibility. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Through Retrospection: Improving Trajectory Prediction for Automated Driving with Error Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13785v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In automated driving, predicting trajectories of surrounding vehicles supports reasoning about scene dynamics and enables safe planning for the ego vehicle. However, existing models handle predictions as an instantaneous task of forecasting future trajectories based on observed information. As time proceeds, the next prediction is made independently of the previous one, which means that the model cannot correct its errors during inference and will repeat them. To alleviate this problem and better leverage temporal data, we propose a novel retrospection technique. Through training on closed-loop rollouts the model learns to use aggregated feedback. Given new observations it reflects on previous predictions and analyzes its errors to improve the quality of subsequent predictions. Thus, the model can learn to correct systematic errors during inference. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse demonstrate a considerable decrease in minimum Average Displacement Error of up to 31.9% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline without retrospection. We further showcase the robustness of our technique by demonstrating a better handling of out-of-distribution scenarios with undetected road-users.</p></details> |  |

So we present a lightweight multi-modal framework for 3D object detection and trajectory prediction. Our system synergistically integrates LiDAR and camera inputs to achieve real-time perception of pedestrians, vehicles, and riders in 3D space. The framework proposes two novel modules: 1) a Cross-Modal Deformable Transformer (CMDT) for object detection with high accuracy and acceptable amount of computation, and 2) a Reference Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse trajectory prediction of mult-class objects with flexible trajectory lengths. Evaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate superior performance over existing methods across detection (+2.03% in mAP) and trajectory prediction (-0.408m in minADE5 of pedestrians) metrics. Remarkably, the system exhibits exceptional deployability - when implemented on a wheelchair robot with an entry-level NVIDIA 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.2 fps. To facilitate reproducibility and practical deployment, we release the related code of the method at https://github.com/TossherO/3D_Perception and its ROS inference version at https://github.com/TossherO/ros_packages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Robotic Skill Acquisition From a Suboptimal Demonstration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03131v4)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from Demonstration (LfD) has emerged as a crucial method for robots to acquire new skills. However, when given suboptimal task trajectory demonstrations with shape characteristics reflecting human preferences but subpar dynamic attributes such as slow motion, robots not only need to mimic the behaviors but also optimize the dynamic performance. In this work, we leverage optimization-based methods to search for a superior-performing trajectory whose shape is similar to that of the demonstrated trajectory. Specifically, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to quantify the difference between two trajectories and combine it with additional performance metrics, such as collision cost, to construct the cost function. Moreover, we develop a multi-policy version of the Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP), called MSTOMP, which is more stable and robust to parameter changes. To deal with the jitter in the demonstrated trajectory, we further utilize the gain-controlling method in the frequency domain to denoise the demonstration and propose a computationally more efficient metric, called Mean Square Error in the Spectrum (MSES), that measures the trajectories' differences in the frequency domain. We also theoretically highlight the connections between the time domain and the frequency domain methods. Finally, we verify our method in both simulation experiments and real-world experiments, showcasing its improved optimization performance and stability compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Estimation of Battery State of Health Using Reference Voltage Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13324v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of state of health (SOH) is critical for battery applications. Current model-based SOH estimation methods typically rely on low C-rate constant current tests to extract health parameters like solid phase volume fraction and lithium-ion stoichiometry, which are often impractical in real-world scenarios due to time and operational constraints. Additionally, these methods are susceptible to modeling uncertainties that can significantly degrade the estimation accuracy, especially when jointly estimating multiple parameters. In this paper, we present a novel reference voltage-based method for robust battery SOH estimation. This method utilizes the voltage response of a battery under a predefined current excitation at the beginning of life (BOL) as a reference to compensate for modeling uncertainty. As the battery degrades, the same excitation is applied to generate the voltage response, which is compared with the BOL trajectory to estimate the key health parameters accurately. The current excitation is optimally designed using the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to maximize the information content of the target parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves parameter estimation accuracy under different degradation levels, compared to conventional methods relying only on direct voltage measurements. Furthermore, our method jointly estimates four key SOH parameters in only 10 minutes, making it practical for real-world battery health diagnostics, e.g., fast testing to enable battery repurposing.</p></details> |  |

However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher.

| **[Set You Straight: Auto-Steering Denoising Trajectories to Sidestep Unwanted Concepts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12782v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the ethical deployment of text-to-image models requires effective techniques to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. While concept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based approaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting sampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods rely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which Automatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is built on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free guidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content modification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This inspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the early-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image manifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For single-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map to precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly contribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient erasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile plug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both single and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without compromising the generative fidelity.

This work proposes a flexible language-based framework to adapt generic robotic trajectories produced by off-the-shelf motion planners like RRT, A-star, etc, or learned from human demonstrations. We utilize pre-trained LLMs to adapt trajectory waypoints by generating code as a policy for dense robot manipulation, enabling more complex and flexible instructions than current methods. This approach allows us to incorporate a broader range of commands, including numerical inputs. Compared to state-of-the-art feature-based sequence-to-sequence models which require training, our method does not require task-specific training and offers greater interpretability and more effective feedback mechanisms. We validate our approach through simulation experiments on the robotic manipulator, aerial vehicle, and ground robot in the Pybullet and Gazebo simulation environments, demonstrating that LLMs can successfully adapt trajectories to complex human instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL LangRob workshop 2024</p></details> |

Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into a student generator to achieve one-step generation, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack). DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of the teacher model, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the teacher model's intermediate distributions, and its reverse can be viewed as the convergence trajectory from the student generator to the teacher model. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions along the path to approximate the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance, with FID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 64x64 dataset. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance.

In complex environments, like modern 3D video games, distribution shift and stochasticity necessitate robust approaches beyond simple action replay. In this study, we apply Inverse Dynamics Models (IDM) with different encoders and policy heads to trajectory following in a modern 3D video game -- Bleeding Edge. Additionally, we investigate several future alignment strategies that address the distribution shift caused by the aleatoric uncertainty and imperfections of the agent. We measure both the trajectory deviation distance and the first significant deviation point between the reference and the agent's trajectory and show that the optimal configuration depends on the chosen setting. Our results show that in a diverse data setting, a GPT-style policy head with an encoder trained from scratch performs the best, DINOv2 encoder with the GPT-style policy head gives the best results in the low data regime, and both GPT-style and MLP-style policy heads had comparable results when pre-trained on a diverse setting and fine-tuned for a specific behaviour setting.</p></details> |  |

This overlooks the critical fact that the tires and the surface are the two force-transmitting partners in vehicle dynamics; while the tires stay with the vehicle, surface conditions vary with location. Recognizing these challenges, this paper presents a novel framework for spatially resolving dynamic constraints in both offline and online planning algorithms applied to autonomous racing. We introduce the GripMap concept, which provides a spatial resolution of vehicle dynamic constraints in the Frenet frame, allowing adaptation to locally varying grip conditions. This enables compensation for location-specific effects, more efficient vehicle behavior, and increased safety, unattainable with spatially invariant vehicle models. The focus is on low storage demand and quick access through perfect hashing. This framework proved advantageous in real-world applications in the presented form. Experiments inspired by autonomous racing demonstrate its effectiveness. In future work, this framework can serve as a foundational layer for developing future interpretable learning algorithms that adjust to varying grip conditions in real-time.</p></details> |  |

We propose to analyse facial landmark trajectories, a compact yet informative representation, that encodes these subtle motions from a high-level structural perspective. Hence, we introduce Trajectory-guided Motion Perception Transformer (TraMP-Former), a novel FEQA framework that fuses landmark trajectory features for fine-grained motion capture with visual semantic cues from RGB frames, ultimately regressing the combined features into a quality score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraMP-Former achieves new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with neurological disorders, including PFED5 (up by 6.51%) and an augmented Toronto NeuroFace (up by 7.62%).

| **[Trajectory Encoding Temporal Graph Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11386v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) have demonstrated significant success in dynamic graph tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Both tasks comprise transductive settings, where the model predicts links among known nodes, and in inductive settings, where it generalises learned patterns to previously unseen nodes. Existing TGN designs face a dilemma under these dual scenarios. Anonymous TGNs, which rely solely on temporal and structural information, offer strong inductive generalisation but struggle to distinguish known nodes. In contrast, non-anonymous TGNs leverage node features to excel in transductive tasks yet fail to adapt to new nodes. To address this challenge, we propose Trajectory Encoding TGN (TETGN). Our approach introduces automatically expandable node identifiers (IDs) as learnable temporal positional features and performs message passing over these IDs to capture each node's historical context. By integrating this trajectory-aware module with a standard TGN using multi-head attention, TETGN effectively balances transductive accuracy with inductive generalisation. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that TETGN significantly outperforms strong baselines on both link prediction and node classification tasks, demonstrating its ability to unify the advantages of anonymous and non-anonymous models for dynamic graph learning.</p></details> |  |

The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Trajectory Embedding for Similarity Computation: When Triangle Inequality Violations in Distance Metrics Matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10933v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity is a cornerstone of trajectory data management and analysis. Traditional similarity functions often suffer from high computational complexity and a reliance on specific distance metrics, prompting a shift towards deep representation learning in Euclidean space. However, existing Euclidean-based trajectory embeddings often face challenges due to the triangle inequality constraints that do not universally hold for trajectory data. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel approach by incorporating non-Euclidean geometry, specifically hyperbolic space, into trajectory representation learning. We present the first-ever integration of hyperbolic space to resolve the inherent limitations of the triangle inequality in Euclidean embeddings. In particular, we achieve it by designing a Lorentz distance measure, which is proven to overcome triangle inequality constraints. Additionally, we design a model-agnostic framework LH-plugin to seamlessly integrate hyperbolic embeddings into existing representation learning pipelines. This includes a novel projection method optimized with the Cosh function to prevent the diminishment of distances, supported by a theoretical foundation. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic fusion distance that intelligently adapts to variations in triangle inequality constraints across different trajectory pairs, blending Lorentzian and Euclidean distances for more robust similarity calculations. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach effectively enhances the accuracy of trajectory similarity measures in state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world datasets. The LH-plugin not only addresses the triangle inequality issues but also significantly refines the precision of trajectory similarity computations, marking a substantial advancement in the field of trajectory representation learning.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

Although predicting the ego-vehicle's path is valuable for driver-assistance systems, existing methods mainly focus on external factors like other vehicles' motions, often neglecting the driver's attention and intent. To address this gap, we infer the ego-trajectory by integrating the driver's gaze and the surrounding scene. We introduce RouteFormer, a novel multimodal ego-trajectory prediction network combining GPS data, environmental context, and the driver's field-of-view, comprising first-person video and gaze fixations. We also present the Path Complexity Index (PCI), a new metric for trajectory complexity that enables a more nuanced evaluation of challenging scenarios. To tackle data scarcity and enhance diversity, we introduce GEM, a comprehensive dataset of urban driving scenarios enriched with synchronized driver field-of-view and gaze data. Extensive evaluations on GEM and DR(eye)VE demonstrate that RouteFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving notable improvements in prediction accuracy across diverse conditions. Ablation studies reveal that incorporating driver field-of-view data yields significantly better average displacement error, especially in challenging scenarios with high PCI scores, underscoring the importance of modeling driver attention.

This paper presents RINGO: Real-time Navigation with a Guiding Trajectory, a novel planning framework that enables aerial manipulators to navigate unknown environments in real time. The proposed method simultaneously considers the positions of both the multi-rotor and the end-effector. A pre-obtained multi-rotor trajectory serves as a guiding reference, allowing the end-effector to generate a smooth, collision-free, and workspace-compatible trajectory. Leveraging the convex hull property of B-spline curves, we theoretically guarantee that the trajectory remains within the reachable workspace. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables real-time navigation of aerial manipulators in unknown environments. The simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method generates less conservative trajectories than approaches that consider only the multi-rotor.</p></details> | 9 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Enhancing Offline Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00601v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) relies on the availability and quality of training data, often requiring extensive interactions with specific environments. In many real-world scenarios, where data collection is costly and risky, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution by utilizing data collected by domain experts and searching for a batch-constrained optimal policy. This approach is further augmented by incorporating external data sources, expanding the range and diversity of data collection possibilities. However, existing offline RL methods often struggle with challenges posed by non-matching data from these external sources. In this work, we specifically address the problem of source-target domain mismatch in scenarios involving mixed datasets, characterized by a predominance of source data generated from random or suboptimal policies and a limited amount of target data generated from higher-quality policies. To tackle this problem, we introduce Transition Scoring (TS), a novel method that assigns scores to transitions based on their similarity to the target domain, and propose Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation (CLTV), which effectively leverages these transition scores to identify and prioritize high-quality trajectories through a curriculum learning approach. Our extensive experiments across various offline RL methods and MuJoCo environments, complemented by rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrate that CLTV enhances the overall performance and transferability of policies learned by offline RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |

Traditional assessment tools often fail to fully cover course content, leading to imprecise evaluations of student mastery. To tackle this problem, the study proposes a knowledge graph construction method based on large language models (LLMs), which transforms learning materials into structured data and generates personalized learning trajectory graphs by analyzing students' test data. Experimental results demonstrate that the model effectively alerts teachers to potential biases in their exam questions and tracks individual student progress. This system not only enhances the accuracy of learning assessments but also helps teachers provide timely guidance to students who are falling behind, thereby improving overall teaching strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Slit Mapping Based Spiral Tool Trajectory Planning for Ball-end Milling on Complex Freeform Surfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06310v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a spiral-based complete coverage strategy for ball-end milling on freeform surfaces, utilizing conformal slit mapping to generate milling trajectories that are more compact, smoother, and evenly distributed when machining 2D cavities with islands. This approach, an upgrade from traditional methods, extends the original algorithm to effectively address 3D perforated surface milling. Unlike conventional algorithms, the method embeds a continuous spiral trajectory within perforated surfaces without requiring cellular decomposition or additional boundaries. The proposed method addresses three primary challenges, including modifying conformal slit mapping for mesh surfaces, maintaining uniform scallop height between adjacent spiral trajectories, and optimizing the mapped origin point to ensure uniform scallop height distribution. To overcome these challenges, surface flattening techniques are incorporated into the original approach to accommodate mesh surfaces effectively. Tool path spacing is then optimized using a binary search strategy to regulate scallop height. A functional energy metric associated with scallop height uniformity is introduced for rapid evaluation of points mapped to the origin, with the minimum functional energy determined through perturbation techniques. The optimal placement of this point is identified using a modified gradient descent approach applied to the energy function. Validation on intricate surfaces, including low-quality and high-genus meshes, verifies the robustness of the algorithm. Surface milling experiments comparing this method with conventional techniques indicate a 15.63% improvement in scallop height uniformity while reducing machining time, average spindle impact, and spindle impact variance by up to 7.36%, 27.79%, and 55.98%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The r...</summary><p>The revised manuscript has improved the quality of the figures</p></details> |
| **[IMPACT: Behavioral Intention-aware Multimodal Trajectory Prediction with Adaptive Context Trimming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09103v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most prior research has focused on improving the precision of multimodal trajectory predictions, the explicit modeling of multimodal behavioral intentions (e.g., yielding, overtaking) remains relatively underexplored. This paper proposes a unified framework that jointly predicts both behavioral intentions and trajectories to enhance prediction accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. Specifically, we employ a shared context encoder for both intention and trajectory predictions, thereby reducing structural redundancy and information loss. Moreover, we address the lack of ground-truth behavioral intention labels in mainstream datasets (Waymo, Argoverse) by auto-labeling these datasets, thus advancing the community's efforts in this direction. We further introduce a vectorized occupancy prediction module that infers the probability of each map polyline being occupied by the target vehicle's future trajectory. By leveraging these intention and occupancy prediction priors, our method conducts dynamic, modality-dependent pruning of irrelevant agents and map polylines in the decoding stage, effectively reducing computational overhead and mitigating noise from non-critical elements. Our approach ranks first among LiDAR-free methods on the Waymo Motion Dataset and achieves first place on the Waymo Interactive Prediction Dataset. Remarkably, even without model ensembling, our single-model framework improves the soft mean average precision (softmAP) by 10 percent compared to the second-best method in the Waymo Interactive Prediction Leaderboard. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been successfully deployed on real vehicles, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | under review |

In this paper, we propose a novel method for trajectory synthesis by adapting the Time-Based Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (TimeVQVAE). Our approach leverages time-frequency domain processing, vector quantization, and transformer-based priors to capture both global and local dynamics in flight data. By discretizing the latent space and integrating transformer priors, the model learns long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and preserves coherence across entire flight paths. We evaluate the adapted TimeVQVAE using an extensive suite of quality, statistical, and distributional metrics, as well as a flyability assessment conducted in an open-source air traffic simulator. Results indicate that TimeVQVAE outperforms a temporal convolutional VAE baseline, generating synthetic trajectories that mirror real flight data in terms of spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and statistical properties. Furthermore, the simulator-based assessment shows that most generated trajectories maintain operational feasibility, although occasional outliers underscore the potential need for additional domain-specific constraints. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of multi-scale representation learning for capturing complex flight behaviors and demonstrate the promise of TimeVQVAE in producing representative synthetic trajectories for downstream tasks such as model training, airspace design, and air traffic forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was presented at the 25th Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS 2025), April 8--10, 2025, Brussels, Belgium</p></details> |
| **[AgentRewardBench: Evaluating Automatic Evaluations of Web Agent Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08942v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web agents enable users to perform tasks on web browsers through natural language interaction. Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations. We release the benchmark at: https://agent-reward-bench.github.io</p></details> |  |

In This paper, an adaptive transpose Jacobian approach is proposed to deal with the dynamic model complexity, which utilizes an adaptive PI-algorithm to adjust the control gains. The performance of the proposed control algorithm is compared with the conventional transpose Jacobian and sliding mode control algorithms and evaluated by the root mean square of the errors and control input energy criteria. In order to appraise the effectiveness of the proposed control system, simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink software for a quadruped robot leg for semi-elliptical path tracking. The obtained results show that the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian reduces the overshoot and root mean square of the errors and at the same time, decreases the control input energy. Moreover, transpose Jacobin and adaptive transpose Jacobian are more robust to changes in initial conditions compared to the conventional sliding mode control. Furthermore, sliding mode control performs well up to 20% uncertainties in the parameters due to its model-based nature, whereas the transpose Jacobin and the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian algorithms show promising results even in higher mass uncertainties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Xplore</p></details> |
| **[On trajectory design from motion primitives for near time-optimal transitions for systems with oscillating internal dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19144v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An efficient approach to compute near time-optimal trajectories for linear kinematic systems with oscillatory internal dynamics is presented. Thereby, kinematic constraints with respect to velocity, acceleration and jerk are taken into account. The trajectories are composed of several motion primitives, the most crucial of which is termed jerk segment. Within this contribution, the focus is put on the composition of the overall trajectories, assuming the required motion primitives to be readily available. Since the scheme considered is not time-optimal, even decreasing particular constraints can reduce the overall transition time, which is analysed in detail. This observation implies that replanning of the underlying jerk segments is required as an integral part of the motion planning scheme, further insight into which has been analysed in a complementary contribution. Although the proposed scheme is not time-optimal, it allows for significantly shorter transition times than established methods, such as zero-vibration shaping, while requiring significantly lower computational power than a fully time-optimal scheme.</p></details> |  |

The proposed filter, the trajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the set of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the set of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated with the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM posterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM density on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution for multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating the set of target states at the end of each time window. Additionally, the paper proposes computationally lighter alternatives to the TM-PMBM filter by deriving a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) density through Kullback-Leibler divergence minimisation in an augmented space with auxiliary variables. The performance of the proposed filters are evaluated in a simulation study.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, journal paper</p></details> |

Moreover, incorporating prior information input into such perception model represents an effective approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy. However, utilizing diverse sources of prior information still faces three key challenges: the acquisition of high-quality prior information, alignment between prior and online perception, efficient integration. To address these issues, we investigate prior augmentation from a novel perspective of trajectory priors. In this paper, we initially extract crowdsourcing trajectory data from Argoverse2 motion forecasting dataset and encode trajectory data into rasterized heatmap and vectorized instance tokens, then we incorporate such prior information into the online mapping model through different ways. Besides, with the purpose of mitigating the misalignment between prior and online perception, we design a confidence-based fusion module that takes alignment into account during the fusion process. We conduct extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 dataset. The results indicate that our method's performance significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

However, estimating trajectories of brain biomarkers is challenging due to biological variability, inconsistencies in measurement protocols (e.g., differences in MRI scanners), scarcity, and irregularity in longitudinal measurements. Herein, we introduce a novel personalized deep kernel regression framework for forecasting brain biomarkers, with application to regional volumetric measurements. Our approach integrates two key components: a population model that captures brain trajectories from a large and diverse cohort, and a subject-specific model that captures individual trajectories. To optimally combine these, we propose Adaptive Shrinkage Estimation, which effectively balances population and subject-specific models. We assess our model's performance through predictive accuracy metrics, uncertainty quantification, and validation against external clinical studies. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models -- including linear mixed effects models, generalized additive models, and deep learning methods -- demonstrates the superior predictive performance of our approach. Additionally, we apply our method to predict trajectories of composite neuroimaging biomarkers, which highlights the versatility of our approach in modeling the progression of longitudinal neuroimaging biomarkers. Furthermore, validation on three external neuroimaging studies confirms the robustness of our method across different clinical contexts. We make the code available at https://github.com/vatass/AdaptiveShrinkageDKGP.</p></details> |  |

In cinematography, Directors of Photography meticulously craft camera movements to achieve expressive and intentional framing. However, existing methods for camera trajectory generation remain limited: Traditional approaches rely on geometric optimization or handcrafted procedural systems, while recent learning-based methods often inherit structural biases or lack textual alignment, constraining creative synthesis. In this work, we introduce an auto-regressive model inspired by the expertise of Directors of Photography to generate artistic and expressive camera trajectories. We first introduce DataDoP, a large-scale multi-modal dataset containing 29K real-world shots with free-moving camera trajectories, depth maps, and detailed captions in specific movements, interaction with the scene, and directorial intent. Thanks to the comprehensive and diverse database, we further train an auto-regressive, decoder-only Transformer for high-quality, context-aware camera movement generation based on text guidance and RGBD inputs, named GenDoP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to existing methods, GenDoP offers better controllability, finer-grained trajectory adjustments, and higher motion stability. We believe our approach establishes a new standard for learning-based cinematography, paving the way for future advancements in camera control and filmmaking.

Traditional approaches often rely on static snapshots of network states, which can obscure the underlying dynamics of opinion evolution. In this study, we introduce a dynamic framework that quantifies the unpredictability of opinion trajectories using the normalized Lempel-Ziv (nLZ) complexity. Our approach leverages an adaptive social network model where each node is characterized by three behavioral parameters - homophily, neophily, and social conformity - and where opinions evolve continuously according to a system of ordinary differential equations. The results reveal distinct nLZ complexity signatures for each node type: homophilic nodes exhibit consistently rising complexity, reflecting increasingly unpredictable opinion shifts that are counterintuitive given their tendency for similarity; neophilic nodes maintain low and stable complexity, suggesting that openness to novelty can, surprisingly, lead to stable opinion dynamics; and conformic nodes display a U-shaped complexity trend, transitioning from early opinion stagnation to later unpredictability. In fully heterogeneous networks, modest interaction effects emerge, with slight shifts in the unpredictability of each faction's trajectories. These findings underscore the importance of temporal analysis in uncovering hidden dynamical patterns, offering novel insights into the mechanisms underlying social adaptation and polarization.</p></details> |  |

Typically such approaches operate by computing $\tilde{N}$ perturbed rollouts around the nominal dynamics to estimate the collision risk associated with a sequence of control commands. We consider a setting where it is expensive to estimate risk using perturbed rollouts, for example, due to expensive collision-checks. We put forward two key contributions. First, we develop an algorithm that distills the statistical information from a larger set of rollouts to a reduced-set with sample size $N<<\tilde{N}$. Consequently, we estimate collision risk using just $N$ rollouts instead of $\tilde{N}$. Second, we formulate a novel surrogate for the collision risk that can leverage the distilled statistical information contained in the reduced-set. We formalize both algorithmic contributions using distribution embedding in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We perform extensive benchmarking to demonstrate that our MMD-based approach leads to safer trajectories at low sample regime than existing baselines using Conditional Value-at Risk (CVaR) based collision risk estimate.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Basant1861/MPC-MMD</p></details> |

The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Novel Diffusion Models for Multimodal 3D Hand Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07375v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting hand motion is critical for understanding human intentions and bridging the action space between human movements and robot manipulations. Existing hand trajectory prediction (HTP) methods forecast the future hand waypoints in 3D space conditioned on past egocentric observations. However, such models are only designed to accommodate 2D egocentric video inputs. There is a lack of awareness of multimodal environmental information from both 2D and 3D observations, hindering the further improvement of 3D HTP performance. In addition, these models overlook the synergy between hand movements and headset camera egomotion, either predicting hand trajectories in isolation or encoding egomotion only from past frames. To address these limitations, we propose novel diffusion models (MMTwin) for multimodal 3D hand trajectory prediction. MMTwin is designed to absorb multimodal information as input encompassing 2D RGB images, 3D point clouds, past hand waypoints, and text prompt. Besides, two latent diffusion models, the egomotion diffusion and the HTP diffusion as twins, are integrated into MMTwin to predict camera egomotion and future hand trajectories concurrently. We propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer module as the denoising model of the HTP diffusion to better fuse multimodal features. The experimental results on three publicly available datasets and our self-recorded data demonstrate that our proposed MMTwin can predict plausible future 3D hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and generalizes well to unseen environments. The code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/MMTwin.</p></details> |  |

It performs optimal controls by directly harnessing input-output (I/O) data, bypassing the process of explicit model identification that can be costly and time-consuming. However, its high computational complexity, driven by a large-scale optimization problem (typically in a higher dimension than its model-based counterpart--Model Predictive Control), hinders real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose the data-enabled neighboring extremal (DeeNE) framework, which significantly reduces computational cost while preserving control performance. DeeNE leverages first-order optimality perturbation analysis to efficiently update a precomputed nominal DeePC solution in response to changes in initial conditions and reference trajectories. We validate its effectiveness on a 7-DoF KINOVA Gen3 robotic arm, demonstrating substantial computational savings and robust, data-driven control performance.</p></details> |  |

Current methods in this space require specific architectural changes to image generation models, which limit their adaptability and scalability. In contrast to such methods, we provide a model-agnostic approach. We use intersections in diffusion trajectories, working only with the latent values. We could not obtain localized frame-wise coherence and diversity using only the intersection of trajectories. Thus, we instead use a grid-based approach. An in-context trained LLM is used to generate coherent frame-wise prompts; another is used to identify differences between frames. Based on these, we obtain a CLIP-based attention mask that controls the timing of switching the prompts for each grid cell. Earlier switching results in higher variance, while later switching results in more coherence. Therefore, our approach can ensure appropriate control between coherence and variance for the frames. Our approach results in state-of-the-art performance while being more flexible when working with diverse image-generation models. The empirical analysis using quantitative metrics and user studies confirms our model's superior temporal consistency, visual fidelity and user satisfaction, thus providing a novel way to obtain training-free, image-based text-to-video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> |

Yet, to fully realize its potential, an effective online trajectory evaluation is indispensable to ensure safety. By forecasting the future outcomes of a given trajectory, trajectory evaluation becomes much more effective. This goal can be achieved by employing a world model to capture environmental dynamics and predict future states. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end driving framework WoTE, which leverages a BEV World model to predict future BEV states for Trajectory Evaluation. The proposed BEV world model is latency-efficient compared to image-level world models and can be seamlessly supervised using off-the-shelf BEV-space traffic simulators. We validate our framework on both the NAVSIM benchmark and the closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark based on the CARLA simulator, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

However, open-loop training on the nuPlan dataset tends to cause causal confusion during closed-loop testing, and the dataset also presents a long-tail distribution of scenarios. These issues introduce challenges for imitation learning. To tackle these problems, we introduce CAFE-AD, a Cross-Scenario Adaptive Feature Enhancement for Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving method, designed to enhance feature representation across various scenario types. We develop an adaptive feature pruning module that ranks feature importance to capture the most relevant information while reducing the interference of noisy information during training. Moreover, we propose a cross-scenario feature interpolation module that enhances scenario information to introduce diversity, enabling the network to alleviate over-fitting in dominant scenarios. We evaluate our method CAFE-AD on the challenging public nuPlan Test14-Hard closed-loop simulation benchmark. The results demonstrate that CAFE-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods including rule-based and hybrid planners, and exhibits the potential in mitigating the impact of long-tail distribution within the dataset. Additionally, we further validate its effectiveness in real-world environments. The code and models will be made available at https://github.com/AlniyatRui/CAFE-AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA ...</summary><p>ICRA 2025; first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

The optimization process yields an optimal control sequence that depends on the initial conditions and system parameters. However, the optimal sequence may result in undesirable behavior if the system's initial conditions and parameters are erroneous. This work presents a data-driven fuzzy controller synthesis framework that is guided by a time-optimal trajectory for multicopter tracking problems. In particular, we consider an aggressive maneuver consisting of a mid-air flip and generate a time-optimal trajectory by numerically solving the two-point boundary value problem. A fuzzy controller consisting of a stabilizing controller near hover conditions and an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) controller, trained to mimic the time-optimal aggressive trajectory, is constructed using the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MECC 2025</p></details> |

The proposed approach is effective with both complete and partial observations, producing refined trajectory signals with kinematic consistency, ensuring that velocity is the integral of acceleration and position is the integral of velocity. Additionally, the method accounts for the constraint that vehicles can only move in the direction of their orientation. The method is implemented as a configurable python library that also enables trajectory estimation solely based on position data. Regularization is applied to prevent extreme state variations. A key application is enhancing recorded trajectory data for use as reference inputs in machine learning models.

Specifically, the UAV's kinematic and camera control inputs are jointly optimized over a rolling planning horizon to achieve complete 3D coverage of the object. The proposed controller incorporates ray-tracing into the planning process to simulate the propagation of light rays, thereby determining the visible parts of the object through the UAV's camera. This integration enables the generation of precise look-ahead coverage trajectories. The coverage planning problem is formulated as a rolling finite-horizon optimal control problem and solved using mixed-integer programming techniques. Extensive real-world and synthetic experiments validate the performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

Aiming at this issue, this paper investigates a differential flatness-based trajectory optimization method for fixed-wing UAVs (DFTO-FW). The customized trajectory representation is presented through differential flat characteristics analysis and polynomial parameterization, eliminating equality constraints to avoid the heavy computational burdens of solving complex dynamics. Through the design of integral performance costs and derivation of analytical gradients, the original trajectory optimization is transcribed into a lightweight, unconstrained, gradient-analytical optimization with linear time complexity to improve efficiency further. The simulation experiments illustrate the superior efficiency of the DFTO-FW, which takes sub-second CPU time (on a personal desktop) against other competitors by orders of magnitude to generate fixed-wing UAV trajectories in randomly generated obstacle environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version with minor language and formatting edits.

The proposed method is measurement-based and decomposes the voltage trajectory into two key components using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD): a residual part, which indicates delayed voltage recovery, and an oscillatory part, which captures oscillations. The residual component is critical, as it can detect activation of OELs in synchronous generators or Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) relays in inverter-based resources, potentially leading to instability within the quasisteady-state time frame. Meanwhile, the oscillatory component may indicate either a stable or unstable state in the short term. To accurately assess stability, STVSI employs an entropy-based metric to measure the proximity of the system to instability, with specific indices for short-term voltage stability based on oscillations and recovery. Simulations on the Nordic power system demonstrate that STVSI effectively identifies and categorizes voltage stability issues. Moreover, STVSI not only detects voltage stability conditions but also qualitatively assesses the extent of stability, providing a nuanced measure of stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted for publication in IEEE PESGM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Vision-Language Model Predictive Control for Manipulation Planning and Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05225v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a widely adopted control paradigm that leverages predictive models to estimate future system states and optimize control inputs accordingly. However, while MPC excels in planning and control, it lacks the capability for environmental perception, leading to failures in complex and unstructured scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce Vision-Language Model Predictive Control (VLMPC), a robotic manipulation planning framework that integrates the perception power of vision-language models (VLMs) with MPC. VLMPC utilizes a conditional action sampling module that takes a goal image or language instruction as input and leverages VLM to generate candidate action sequences. These candidates are fed into a video prediction model that simulates future frames based on the actions. In addition, we propose an enhanced variant, Traj-VLMPC, which replaces video prediction with motion trajectory generation to reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. Traj-VLMPC estimates motion dynamics conditioned on the candidate actions, offering a more efficient alternative for long-horizon tasks and real-time applications. Both VLMPC and Traj-VLMPC select the optimal action sequence using a VLM-based hierarchical cost function that captures both pixel-level and knowledge-level consistency between the current observation and the task input. We demonstrate that both approaches outperform existing state-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks and achieve excellent performance in various real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Despite recent advancements in place recognition using 2D cameras or 3D LiDAR, it remains to be seen how to use 4D radar for place recognition - an increasingly popular sensor for its robustness against adverse weather and lighting conditions. Compared to LiDAR point clouds, radar data are drastically sparser, noisier and in much lower resolution, which hampers their ability to effectively represent scenes, posing significant challenges for 4D radar-based place recognition. This work addresses these challenges by leveraging multi-modal information from sequential 4D radar scans and effectively extracting and aggregating spatio-temporal features.Our approach follows a principled pipeline that comprises (1) dynamic points removal and ego-velocity estimation from velocity property, (2) bird's eye view (BEV) feature encoding on the refined point cloud, (3) feature alignment using BEV feature map motion trajectory calculated by ego-velocity, (4) multi-scale spatio-temporal features of the aligned BEV feature maps are extracted and aggregated.Real-world experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed method and demonstrate its robustness in handling dynamic environments.

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging an intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.</p></details> |  |

Our model builds upon the recent Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) that achieve state-of-the-art sparse-view reconstruction quality. However, existing LRMs struggle to reconstruct unseen parts accurately and cannot recover glossy appearance or generate relightable 3D contents that can be consumed by standard Graphics engines. To address these limitations, we make three key technical contributions to build a more practical multi-view 3D reconstruction framework. First, we introduce an update model that allows us to progressively add more input views to improve our reconstruction. Second, we propose a hexa-plane neural SDF representation to better recover detailed textures, geometry and material parameters. Third, we develop a novel neural directional-embedding mechanism to handle view-dependent effects. Trained on a large-scale shape and material dataset with a tailored coarse-to-fine training scheme, our model achieves compelling results. It compares favorably to optimization-based dense-view inverse rendering methods in terms of geometry and relighting accuracy, while requiring only a fraction of the inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Modular Machine Learning: An Indispensable Path towards New-Generation Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20020v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically advanced machine learning research including natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, etc., yet they still exhibit critical limitations in reasoning, factual consistency, and interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm -- Modular Machine Learning (MML) -- as an essential approach toward new-generation LLMs. MML decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular reasoning, aiming to enhance LLMs' capability of counterfactual reasoning, mitigating hallucinations, as well as promoting fairness, safety, and transparency. Specifically, the proposed MML paradigm can: i) clarify the internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We present a feasible implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and neuro-symbolic learning. We critically identify key challenges, such as the integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, the integration of the MML paradigm with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical (deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world applications.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is critical but often struggles with accuracy and efficiency in complex layouts and ambiguous text. These challenges are especially pronounced in large-scale tasks requiring both speed and precision. This paper introduces LMV-RPA, a Large Model Voting-based Robotic Process Automation system to enhance OCR workflows. LMV-RPA integrates outputs from OCR engines such as Paddle OCR, Tesseract OCR, Easy OCR, and DocTR with Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA 3 and Gemini-1.5-pro. Using a majority voting mechanism, it processes OCR outputs into structured JSON formats, improving accuracy, particularly in complex layouts. The multi-phase pipeline processes text extracted by OCR engines through LLMs, combining results to ensure the most accurate outputs. LMV-RPA achieves 99 percent accuracy in OCR tasks, surpassing baseline models with 94 percent, while reducing processing time by 80 percent. Benchmark evaluations confirm its scalability and demonstrate that LMV-RPA offers a faster, more reliable, and efficient solution for automating large-scale document processing tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 figures, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

However, SDS-based methods struggle to maintain semantic fidelity for user prompts, particularly when involving multiple objects with intricate interactions. While existing approaches often address 3D consistency through multiview diffusion model fine-tuning on 3D datasets, this strategy inadvertently exacerbates text-3D alignment degradation. The limitation stems from SDS's inherent accumulation of view-independent biases during optimization, which progressively diverges from the ideal text alignment direction. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel SDS objective, dubbed as Textual Coherent Score Distillation (TCSD), which integrates alignment feedback from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our TCSD leverages cross-modal understanding capabilities of MLLMs to assess and guide the text-3D correspondence during the optimization. We further develop 3DLLaVA-CRITIC - a fine-tuned MLLM specialized for evaluating multiview text alignment in 3D generations. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-layout initialization that significantly accelerates optimization convergence through semantic-aware spatial configuration. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework, CoherenDream, establishes state-of-the-art performance in text-aligned 3D generation across multiple benchmarks, including T$^3$Bench and TIFA subset. Qualitative results showcase the superior performance of CoherenDream in preserving textual consistency and semantic interactions. As the first study to incorporate MLLMs into SDS optimization, we also conduct extensive ablation studies to explore optimal MLLM adaptations for 3D generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional cybersecurity approaches, often based on static rules and predefined scenarios, are struggling to adapt to the rapidly evolving nature of modern cyberattacks. There is an urgent need for more adaptive and intelligent defence strategies. The emergence of Large Language Model (LLM) provides an innovative solution to cope with the increasingly severe cyber threats, and its potential in analysing complex attack patterns, predicting threats and assisting real-time response has attracted a lot of attention in the field of cybersecurity, and exploring how to effectively use LLM to defend against cyberattacks has become a hot topic in the current research field. This survey examines the applications of LLM from the perspective of the cyber attack lifecycle, focusing on the three phases of defense reconnaissance, foothold establishment, and lateral movement, and it analyzes the potential of LLMs in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tasks. Meanwhile, we investigate how LLM-based security solutions are deployed and applied in different network scenarios. It also summarizes the internal and external risk issues faced by LLM during its application. Finally, this survey also points out the facing risk issues and possible future research directions in this domain.</p></details> | 20 pages, 3 figures |

Lineage Matters in Predicting Large Language Model Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19811v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately forecasting the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) before extensive fine-tuning or merging can substantially reduce both computational expense and development time. Although prior approaches like scaling laws account for global factors such as parameter size or training tokens, they often overlook explicit lineage relationships - i.e., which models are derived or merged from which parents. In this work, we propose a novel Lineage-Regularized Matrix Factorization (LRMF) framework that encodes ancestral ties among LLMs via a graph Laplacian regularizer. By leveraging multi-hop parent-child connections, LRMF consistently outperforms conventional matrix factorization and collaborative filtering methods in both instance-level and benchmark-level performance prediction. Our large-scale study includes 2,934 publicly available Hugging Face models and 21,000+ instances across 6 major benchmarks, showing that lineage constraints yield up to 7-10 percentage points higher correlation with actual performance compared to baselines. Moreover, LRMF effectively addresses the cold-start problem, providing accurate estimates for newly derived or merged models even with minimal data. This lineage-guided strategy thus offers a resource-efficient way to inform hyperparameter tuning, data selection, and model combination in modern LLM development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models for Effective Label-free Node Classification in Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11983v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the preferred models for node classification in graph data due to their robust capabilities in integrating graph structures and attributes. However, these models heavily depend on a substantial amount of high-quality labeled data for training, which is often costly to obtain. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), a promising approach is to utilize their exceptional zero-shot capabilities and extensive knowledge for node labeling. Despite encouraging results, this approach either requires numerous queries to LLMs or suffers from reduced performance due to noisy labels generated by LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce Locle, an active self-training framework that does Label-free node Classification with LLMs cost-Effectively. Locle iteratively identifies small sets of "critical" samples using GNNs and extracts informative pseudo-labels for them with both LLMs and GNNs, serving as additional supervision signals to enhance model training. Specifically, Locle comprises three key components: (i) an effective active node selection strategy for initial annotations; (ii) a careful sample selection scheme to identify "critical" nodes based on label disharmonicity and entropy; and (iii) a label refinement module that combines LLMs and GNNs with a rewired topology. Extensive experiments on five benchmark text-attributed graph datasets demonstrate that Locle significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same query budget to LLMs in terms of label-free node classification. Notably, on the DBLP dataset with 14.3k nodes, Locle achieves an 8.08% improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art at a cost of less than one cent. Our code is available at https://github.com/HKBU-LAGAS/Locle.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

This study constructs a diverse corpus encompassing Chinese scientific terminology, historical translation paradoxes, and literary metaphors. Utilizing a back-translation and Friedman test-based evaluation system (BT-Fried), we evaluate BLEU, CHRF, TER, and semantic similarity metrics across six major LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.5, DeepSeek V3) and three traditional translation tools. Key findings include: (1) Scientific abstracts often benefit from back-translation, while traditional tools outperform LLMs in linguistically distinct texts; (2) LLMs struggle with cultural and literary retention, exemplifying the "paradox of poetic intent"; (3) Some models exhibit "verbatim back-translation", reflecting emergent memory behavior; (4) A novel BLEU variant using Jieba segmentation and n-gram weighting is proposed.

We propose SandBoxFuzz, a scalable grey-box fuzzing technique that addresses these limitations by leveraging aspect-oriented programming and runtime reflection to enable dynamic specification mining, generating targeted inputs for constrained environments. SandBoxFuzz also introduces a log-based coverage mechanism, seamlessly integrated into the build pipeline, eliminating the need for runtime coverage agents that are often infeasible in industrial settings. SandBoxFuzz has been successfully deployed to Ant Group's production line and, compared to an initial solution built on a state-of-the-art fuzzing framework, it demonstrates superior performance in their microservices software. SandBoxFuzz achieves a 7.5% increase in branch coverage, identifies 1,850 additional exceptions, and reduces setup time from hours to minutes, highlighting its effectiveness and practical utility in a real-world industrial environment. By open-sourcing SandBoxFuzz, we provide a practical and effective tool for researchers and practitioners to test large-scale microservices systems.</p></details> |  |

To optimize this process, HLS prediction tasks often employ message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), leveraging complex architectures to achieve high accuracy. These predictors serve as evaluators in the DSE process, effectively bypassing the time-consuming estimations traditionally required by HLS tools. However, existing models often prioritize structural complexity and minimization of training loss, overlooking task-specific characteristics. Additionally, while evolutionary algorithms are widely used in DSE, they typically require extensive domain-specific knowledge to design effective crossover and mutation operators. To address these limitations, we propose CoGNNs-LLMEA, a framework that integrates a graph neural network with task-adaptive message passing and a large language model-enhanced evolutionary algorithm. As a predictive model, CoGNNs directly leverages intermediate representations generated from source code after compiler front-end processing, enabling prediction of quality of results (QoR) without invoking HLS tools. Due to its strong adaptability to tasks, CoGNNs can be tuned to predict post-HLS and post-implementation outcomes, effectively bridging the gap between high-level abstractions and physical implementation characteristics. CoGNNs achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in post-HLS QoR prediction, reducing mean prediction errors by 2.8$\times$ for latency and 3.4$\times$ for resource utilization compared to baseline models.</p></details> |  |

However, when integrated into search frameworks for iterative algorithm search, the underlying fitness landscape--critical for understanding search behaviou--remains underexplored. In this paper, we illustrate and analyze the fitness landscape of LLM-assisted Algorithm Search (LAS) using a graph-based approach, where nodes represent algorithms and edges denote transitions between them. We conduct extensive evaluations across six algorithm design tasks and six commonly used LLMs. Our findings reveal that LAS landscapes are highly multimodal and rugged, particularly in combinatorial optimization tasks, with distinct structural variations across tasks and LLMs. For instance, heuristic design tasks exhibit dense clusters of high-performing algorithms, while symbolic regression tasks show sparse, scattered distributions. Additionally, we demonstrate how population size influences exploration-exploitation trade-offs and the evolving trajectory of elite algorithms. These insights not only advance our understanding of LAS landscapes but also provide practical guidance for designing more effective LAS methods.</p></details> |  |

For example, Text-to-SQL requires SQL queries and correspond natural language questions as training samples. However, collecting such query corpus remains challenging in practice due to the high cost of manual annotation, which highlights the importance of automatic SQL generation. Despite recent advances, existing generation methods still face limitations in achieving both diversity and cost-effectiveness. Besides, many methods also treat all tables equally, which overlooks schema complexity and leads to under-utilization of structurally rich tables. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-agent framework for high-quality and large-scale SQL generation, dubbed SQL-Factory. It decomposes the generation process into three collaborative teams: the Generation Team explores diverse query structures using a powerful language model, the Expansion Team scales promising patterns via a lightweight language model, and the Management Team adaptively schedules the workflow and evaluates the quality of synthesized queries. This modular framework ensures a balanced trade-off between diversity, scalability, and generation cost. We apply SQL-Factory to four widely used benchmarks and generate over 300,000 SQL queries with less than $200 API cost. Our generated queries achieve higher diversity compared to other methods, and extensive experiments demonstrate that the generated queries significantly improve the model performance in various downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

Using coupled partial integro-differential equations to describe leader and follower density dynamics, we establish feasibility conditions and develop two control architectures ensuring global stability. The first employs feed-forward control on the followers' and a feedback on the leaders' density. The second implements a dual feedback loop through a reference-governor that adapts the leaders' density based on both populations' measurements. Our methods, initially developed in a one-dimensional setting, are extended to multi-dimensional cases, and validated through numerical simulations for representative control applications, both for groups of infinite and finite size.</p></details> |  |
| **[GVPO: Group Variance Policy Optimization for Large Language Model Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19599v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training plays a crucial role in refining and aligning large language models to meet specific tasks and human preferences. While recent advancements in post-training techniques, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), leverage increased sampling with relative reward scoring to achieve superior performance, these methods often suffer from training instability that limits their practical adoption. To address this challenge, we present Group Variance Policy Optimization (GVPO). GVPO incorporates the analytical solution to KL-constrained reward maximization directly into its gradient weights, ensuring alignment with the optimal policy. The method provides intuitive physical interpretations: its gradient mirrors the mean squared error between the central distance of implicit rewards and that of actual rewards. GVPO offers two key advantages: (1) it guarantees a unique optimal solution, exactly the KL-constrained reward maximization objective, (2) it supports flexible sampling distributions that avoids on-policy and importance sampling limitations. By unifying theoretical guarantees with practical adaptability, GVPO establishes a new paradigm for reliable and versatile LLM post-training.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the challenge posed by the complex hierarchy of biomedical knowledge, we propose a knowledge-driven, multi-agent framework for scientific corpus distillation tailored for LLM training in the biomedical domain. Central to our approach is a collaborative multi-agent architecture, where specialized agents, each guided by the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) hierarchy, work in concert to autonomously extract, synthesize, and self-evaluate high-quality textual data from vast scientific literature. These agents collectively generate and refine domain-specific question-answer pairs, ensuring comprehensive coverage and consistency with biomedical ontologies while minimizing manual involvement. Extensive experimental results show that language models trained on our multi-agent distilled datasets achieve notable improvements in biomedical question-answering tasks, outperforming both strong life sciences LLM baselines and advanced proprietary models. Notably, our AI-Ready dataset enables Llama3-70B to surpass GPT-4 with MedPrompt and Med-PaLM-2, despite their larger scale. Detailed ablation studies and case analyses further validate the effectiveness and synergy of each agent within the framework, highlighting the potential of multi-agent collaboration in biomedical LLM training.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, Large Language Model, Agentic AI, Dataset Distillation, Multi-agent Collaboration</p></details> |

Personalized food recommendations can help address these challenges by tailoring meal plans to individual preferences, habits, and dietary restrictions. However, existing dietary recommendation systems often lack adaptability, fail to consider real-world constraints such as food ingredient availability, and require extensive user input, making them impractical for sustainable and scalable daily use. To address these limitations, we introduce NutriGen, a framework based on large language models (LLM) designed to generate personalized meal plans that align with user-defined dietary preferences and constraints. By building a personalized nutrition database and leveraging prompt engineering, our approach enables LLMs to incorporate reliable nutritional references like the USDA nutrition database while maintaining flexibility and ease-of-use. We demonstrate that LLMs have strong potential in generating accurate and user-friendly food recommendations, addressing key limitations in existing dietary recommendation systems by providing structured, practical, and scalable meal plans. Our evaluation shows that Llama 3.1 8B and GPT-3.5 Turbo achieve the lowest percentage errors of 1.55\% and 3.68\%, respectively, producing meal plans that closely align with user-defined caloric targets while minimizing deviation and improving precision. Additionally, we compared the performance of DeepSeek V3 against several established models to evaluate its potential in personalized nutrition planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Reasoning Performance in Large Language Models via Representation Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19483v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have resulted in increasingly anthropomorphic language concerning the ability of LLMs to reason. Whether reasoning in LLMs should be understood to be inherently different is, however, widely debated. We propose utilizing a representation engineering approach wherein model activations are read from the residual stream of an LLM when processing a reasoning task. The activations are used to derive a control vector that is applied to the model as an inference-time intervention, modulating the representational space of the model, to improve performance on the specified task. We publish the code for deriving control vectors and analyzing model representations. The method allows us to improve performance on reasoning benchmarks and assess how control vectors influence the final logit distribution of a model via metrics such as KL divergence and entropy. We apply control vectors to Mistral-7B-Instruct and a range of Pythia models on an inductive, a deductive and mathematical reasoning task. We show that an LLM can, to a certain degree, be controlled to improve its perceived reasoning ability by modulating activations. The intervention is dependent upon the ability to reliably extract the model's typical state when correctly solving a task. Our results suggest that reasoning performance can be modulated in the same manner as other information-processing tasks performed by LLMs and demonstrate that we are capable of improving performance on specific tasks via a simple intervention on the residual stream with no additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Has b...</summary><p>Has been accepted at "The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)" Link to publication: https://openreview.net/forum?id=IssPhpUsKt</p></details> |

Preasymptotic error bounds are derived, showing that, under the mesh condition $\kappa^{2p+1}h^{2p}$ being sufficiently small, the error of the EEM of order $p$ in the energy norm is bounded by $\mathcal{O}\big(\kappa^{p}h^p + \kappa^{2p+1}h^{2p}\big)$, while the error in the $\kappa$-scaled $\boldsymbol{L}^2$ norm is bounded by $\mathcal{O}\big((\kappa h)^{p+1} + \kappa^{2p+1} h^{2p}\big)$. Here, $\kappa$ is the wave number and $h$ is the mesh size. Numerical tests are provided to illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Automated Reinforcement Learning Reward Design Framework with Large Language Model for Cooperative Platoon Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19480v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated excellent decision-making potential in platoon coordination problems. However, due to the variability of coordination goals, the complexity of the decision problem, and the time-consumption of trial-and-error in manual design, finding a well performance reward function to guide RL training to solve complex platoon coordination problems remains challenging. In this paper, we formally define the Platoon Coordination Reward Design Problem (PCRDP), extending the RL-based cooperative platoon coordination problem to incorporate automated reward function generation. To address PCRDP, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Platoon coordination Reward Design (PCRD) framework, which systematically automates reward function discovery through LLM-driven initialization and iterative optimization. In this method, LLM first initializes reward functions based on environment code and task requirements with an Analysis and Initial Reward (AIR) module, and then iteratively optimizes them based on training feedback with an evolutionary module. The AIR module guides LLM to deepen their understanding of code and tasks through a chain of thought, effectively mitigating hallucination risks in code generation. The evolutionary module fine-tunes and reconstructs the reward function, achieving a balance between exploration diversity and convergence stability for training. To validate our approach, we establish six challenging coordination scenarios with varying complexity levels within the Yangtze River Delta transportation network simulation. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that RL agents utilizing PCRD-generated reward functions consistently outperform human-engineered reward functions, achieving an average of 10\% higher performance metrics in all scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, current evaluations of LLMs in clinical contexts remain limited. Most existing benchmarks rely on medical exam-style questions or PubMed-derived text, failing to capture the complexity of real-world electronic health record (EHR) data. Others focus narrowly on specific application scenarios, limiting their generalizability across broader clinical use. To address this gap, we present BRIDGE, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 87 tasks sourced from real-world clinical data sources across nine languages. We systematically evaluated 52 state-of-the-art LLMs (including DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Llama 4) under various inference strategies. With a total of 13,572 experiments, our results reveal substantial performance variation across model sizes, languages, natural language processing tasks, and clinical specialties. Notably, we demonstrate that open-source LLMs can achieve performance comparable to proprietary models, while medically fine-tuned LLMs based on older architectures often underperform versus updated general-purpose models. The BRIDGE and its corresponding leaderboard serve as a foundational resource and a unique reference for the development and evaluation of new LLMs in real-world clinical text understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, their reliability remains a concern due to potential biases inherited from their training process. In this study, we examine how different response format: binary versus continuous, may systematically influence LLMs' judgments. In a value statement judgments task and a text sentiment analysis task, we prompted LLMs to simulate human responses and tested both formats across several models, including both open-source and commercial models. Our findings revealed a consistent negative bias: LLMs were more likely to deliver "negative" judgments in binary formats compared to continuous ones. Control experiments further revealed that this pattern holds across both tasks. Our results highlight the importance of considering response format when applying LLMs to decision tasks, as small changes in task design can introduce systematic biases.</p></details> |  |

However, these comments often become outdated as software evolves, degrading model performance. Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating high-quality code comments. We investigate whether replacing human-written comments with LLM-generated ones improves pre-training datasets. Since standard metrics cannot assess reference comment quality, we propose two novel reference-free evaluation tasks: code-comment inconsistency detection and semantic code search. Results show that LLM-generated comments are more semantically consistent with code than human-written ones, as confirmed by manual evaluation. Leveraging this finding, we rebuild the CodeSearchNet dataset with LLM-generated comments and re-pre-train CodeT5. Evaluations demonstrate that models trained on LLM-enhanced data outperform those using original human comments in code summarization, generation, and translation tasks. This work validates rebuilding pre-training datasets with LLMs to advance code intelligence, challenging the traditional reliance on human reference comments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Award...</summary><p>Awarded the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award in ICPC 2025</p></details> |

While existing 3DGS methods perform well in scenes with minor view variation, large view changes from cross-view data pose optimization challenges for these methods. To address these issues, we propose a novel cross-view Gaussian Splatting method for large-scale scene reconstruction based on multi-branch construction and fusion. Our method independently reconstructs models from different sets of views as multiple independent branches to establish the baselines of Gaussian distribution, providing reliable priors for cross-view reconstruction during initialization and densification. Specifically, a gradient-aware regularization strategy is introduced to mitigate smoothing issues caused by significant view disparities. Additionally, a unique Gaussian supplementation strategy is utilized to incorporate complementary information of multi-branch into the cross-view model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in novel view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Debiased Estimating Equation Method for Robust and Efficient Mendelian Randomization Using a Large Number of Correlated Weak and Invalid Instruments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05386v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mendelian randomization (MR) is a widely used tool for causal inference in the presence of unmeasured confounders, which uses single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects. However, SNPs often have weak effects on complex traits, leading to bias in existing MR analysis when weak instruments are included. In addition, existing MR methods often restrict analysis to independent SNPs via linkage disequilibrium clumping and result in a loss of efficiency in estimating the causal effect due to discarding correlated SNPs. To address these issues, we propose the Debiased Estimating Equation Method (DEEM), a summary statistics-based MR approach that can incorporate a large number of correlated, weak-effect, and invalid SNPs. DEEM effectively eliminates the weak instrument bias and improves the statistical efficiency of the causal effect estimation by leveraging information from a large number of correlated SNPs. DEEM also allows for pleiotropic effects, adjusts for the winner's curse, and applies to both two-sample and one-sample MR analyses. Asymptotic analyses of the DEEM estimator demonstrate its attractive theoretical properties. Through extensive simulations and two real data examples, we demonstrate that DEEM significantly improves the efficiency and robustness of MR analysis compared with existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Previously, MER2023 focused on multi-label learning, noise robustness, and semi-supervised learning, while MER2024 introduced a new track dedicated to open-vocabulary emotion recognition. This year, MER2025 centers on the theme "When Affective Computing Meets Large Language Models (LLMs)".We aim to shift the paradigm from traditional categorical frameworks reliant on predefined emotion taxonomies to LLM-driven generative methods, offering innovative solutions for more accurate and reliable emotion understanding. The challenge features four tracks: MER-SEMI focuses on fixed categorical emotion recognition enhanced by semi-supervised learning; MER-FG explores fine-grained emotions, expanding recognition from basic to nuanced emotional states; MER-DES incorporates multimodal cues (beyond emotion words) into predictions to enhance model interpretability; MER-PR investigates whether emotion prediction results can improve personality recognition performance. For the first three tracks, baseline code is available at MERTools, and datasets can be accessed via Hugging Face. For the last track, the dataset and baseline code are available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we frame data contamination detection as a series of multiple-choice questions, devising a quiz format wherein three perturbed versions of each instance, subsampled from a specific dataset partition, are created. These changes only include word-level perturbations. The generated perturbations, along with the original dataset instance, form the options in the DCQ, with an extra option accommodating the selection of none of the provided options. Given that the only distinguishing signal among the options is the exact wording with respect to the original dataset instance, an LLM, when tasked with identifying the original dataset instance, gravitates towards selecting the original one if it has been exposed to it. While accounting for positional biases in LLMs, the quiz performance reveals the contamination level for the tested model with the dataset partition to which the quiz pertains. Applied to various datasets and LLMs, under controlled and uncontrolled contamination, our findings, while fully lacking access to training data and model parameters, suggest that DCQ achieves state-of-the-art results and uncovers greater contamination levels through memorization compared to existing methods. Also, it proficiently bypasses more safety filters, especially those set to avoid generating copyrighted content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final version; accepted at TACL</p></details> |

In this paper, we conduct the first systematic and controlled study on the potential privacy risks associated with visual reasoning abilities of ChatGPT o3. We manually collect and construct a dataset comprising 50 real-world images that feature individuals alongside privacy-relevant environmental elements, capturing realistic and sensitive scenarios for analysis. Our experimental evaluation reveals that ChatGPT o3 can predict user locations with high precision, achieving street-level accuracy (within one mile) in 60% of cases. Through analysis, we identify key visual cues, including street layout and front yard design, that significantly contribute to the model inference success. Additionally, targeted occlusion experiments demonstrate that masking critical features effectively mitigates geolocation accuracy, providing insights into potential defense mechanisms. Our findings highlight an urgent need for privacy-aware development for agentic multi-modal large reasoning models, particularly in applications involving private imagery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quasi-random Multi-Sample Inference for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06251v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are often equipped with multi-sample decoding strategies. An LLM implicitly defines an arithmetic code book, facilitating efficient and embarrassingly parallelizable \textbf{arithmetic sampling} to produce multiple samples using quasi-random codes. Traditional text generation methods, such as beam search and sampling-based techniques, have notable limitations: they lack parallelizability or diversity of sampled sequences. This study explores the potential of arithmetic sampling, contrasting it with ancestral sampling across two decoding tasks that employ multi-sample inference: chain-of-thought reasoning with self-consistency and machine translation with minimum Bayes risk decoding. Our results demonstrate that arithmetic sampling produces more diverse samples, significantly improving reasoning and translation performance as the sample size increases. We observe a $\mathbf{3\text{-}5\%}$ point increase in accuracy on the GSM8K dataset and a $\mathbf{0.45\text{-}0.89\%}$ point increment in COMET score for WMT19 tasks using arithmetic sampling without any significant computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is widely used to assess the understanding capability of LMMs, but it does not guarantee that LMMs truly comprehend the answer. UPD assesses the LMM's ability to withhold answers when encountering unsolvable problems of MCQA, verifying whether the model truly understands the answer. UPD encompasses three problems: Absent Answer Detection (AAD), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (IASD), and Incompatible Visual Question Detection (IVQD), covering unsolvable cases like answer-lacking or incompatible choices and image-question mismatches. For the evaluation, we introduce the MM-UPD Bench, a benchmark for assessing performance across various ability dimensions. Our experiments reveal that even most LMMs, which demonstrate adequate performance on existing benchmarks, struggle significantly with MM-UPD, underscoring a novel aspect of trustworthiness that current benchmarks have overlooked. A detailed analysis shows that LMMs have different bottlenecks and chain-of-thought and self-reflection improved performance for LMMs with the bottleneck in their LLM capability. We hope our insights will enhance the broader understanding and development of more reliable LMMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/AtsuMiyai/UPD.

Existing benchmarks such as BrowseComp concentrate on English and overlook the linguistic, infrastructural, and censorship-related complexities of other major information ecosystems -- most notably Chinese. To address this gap, we introduce BrowseComp-ZH, a high-difficulty benchmark purpose-built to comprehensively evaluate LLM agents on the Chinese web. BrowseComp-ZH consists of 289 multi-hop questions spanning 11 diverse domains. Each question is reverse-engineered from a short, objective, and easily verifiable answer (e.g., a date, number, or proper noun). A two-stage quality control protocol is applied to strive for high question difficulty and answer uniqueness. We benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art language models and agentic search systems on our proposed BrowseComp-ZH. Despite their strong conversational and retrieval capabilities, most models struggle severely: a large number achieve accuracy rates below 10%, and only a handful exceed 20%. Even the best-performing system, OpenAI's DeepResearch, reaches just 42.9%. These results demonstrate the considerable difficulty of BrowseComp-ZH, where success demands not only effective retrieval strategies, but also sophisticated reasoning and information reconciliation -- capabilities that current models still struggle to master. Our dataset, construction guidelines, and benchmark results have been publicly released at https://github.com/PALIN2018/BrowseComp-ZH.</p></details> | Under Review |

Analyzing Moral Foundation Priorities in Large Language Models with a Multi-Framework Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19255v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in consequential decision-making contexts, systematically assessing their ethical reasoning capabilities becomes a critical imperative. This paper introduces the Priorities in Reasoning and Intrinsic Moral Evaluation (PRIME) framework--a comprehensive methodology for analyzing moral priorities across foundational ethical dimensions including consequentialist-deontological reasoning, moral foundations theory, and Kohlberg's developmental stages. We apply this framework to six leading LLMs through a dual-protocol approach combining direct questioning and response analysis to established ethical dilemmas. Our analysis reveals striking patterns of convergence: all evaluated models demonstrate strong prioritization of care/harm and fairness/cheating foundations while consistently underweighting authority, loyalty, and sanctity dimensions. Through detailed examination of confidence metrics, response reluctance patterns, and reasoning consistency, we establish that contemporary LLMs (1) produce decisive ethical judgments, (2) demonstrate notable cross-model alignment in moral decision-making, and (3) generally correspond with empirically established human moral preferences. This research contributes a scalable, extensible methodology for ethical benchmarking while highlighting both the promising capabilities and systematic limitations in current AI moral reasoning architectures--insights critical for responsible development as these systems assume increasingly significant societal roles.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Borsuk-Ulam and Replicable Learning of Large-Margin Halfspaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15294v3)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent remarkable advances in learning theory have established that, for total concept classes, list replicability, global stability, differentially private (DP) learnability, and shared-randomness replicability all coincide with the finiteness of Littlestone dimension. Does this equivalence extend to partial concept classes? We answer this question by proving that the list replicability number of $d$-dimensional $\gamma$-margin half-spaces satisfies \[ \frac{d}{2}+1 \le \mathrm{LR}(H^d_\gamma) \le d, \] which grows with dimension. Consequently, for partial classes, list replicability and global stability do not necessarily follow from bounded Littlestone dimension, pure DP-learnability, or shared-randomness replicability. Applying our main theorem, we resolve several open problems: $\bullet$ Every disambiguation of infinite-dimensional large-margin half-spaces to a total concept class has unbounded Littlestone dimension, answering an open question of Alon et al. (FOCS '21). $\bullet$ The maximum list-replicability number of any finite set of points and homogeneous half-spaces in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space is $d$, resolving a problem of Chase et al. (FOCS '23). $\bullet$ Every disambiguation of the Gap Hamming Distance problem in the large gap regime has unbounded public-coin randomized communication complexity. This answers an open question of Fang et al. (STOC '25). $\bullet$ There exists a partial concept class with Littlestone dimension $1$ such that all its disambiguations have infinite Littlestone dimension. This answers a question of Cheung et al. (ICALP '23). Our lower bound follows from a topological argument based on the local Borsuk-Ulam theorem of Chase, Chornomaz, Moran, and Yehudayoff (STOC '24). For the upper bound, we construct a list-replicable learning rule using the generalization properties of SVMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added Corollary 1.9 that answers a question of [CHHH23]</p></details> |

Research on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for automated chart understanding has accelerated massively, with steady improvements on standard benchmarks. However, for MLLMs to be reliable, they must be robust to misleading visualizations, charts that distort the underlying data, leading readers to draw inaccurate conclusions that may support disinformation. Here, we uncover an important vulnerability: MLLM question-answering accuracy on misleading visualizations drops on average to the level of a random baseline. To address this, we introduce the first inference-time methods to improve performance on misleading visualizations, without compromising accuracy on non-misleading ones. The most effective method extracts the underlying data table and uses a text-only LLM to answer the question based on the table. Our findings expose a critical blind spot in current research and establish benchmark results to guide future efforts in reliable MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, addressing the cold-start recommendation problem, where users lack historical data, remains a considerable challenge. In this paper, we introduce KALM4Rec (Keyword-driven Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models for Cold-start User Recommendations), a novel framework specifically designed to tackle this problem by requiring only a few input keywords from users in a practical scenario of cold-start user restaurant recommendations. KALM4Rec operates in two main stages: candidates retrieval and LLM-based candidates re-ranking. In the first stage, keyword-driven retrieval models are used to identify potential candidates, addressing LLMs' limitations in processing extensive tokens and reducing the risk of generating misleading information. In the second stage, we employ LLMs with various prompting strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot techniques, to re-rank these candidates by integrating multiple examples directly into the LLM prompts. Our evaluation, using a Yelp restaurant dataset with user reviews from three English-speaking cities, shows that our proposed framework significantly improves recommendation quality. Specifically, the integration of in-context instructions with LLMs for re-ranking markedly enhances the performance of the cold-start user recommender system.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

There have been studies on sentiment analysis of social media platforms during COVID-19 to understand the public response given the rise of cases and government strategies implemented to control the spread of the virus. Sentiment analysis can provide a better understanding of changes in societal opinions and emotional trends during the pandemic. Apart from social media, newspapers have played a vital role in the dissemination of information, including information from the government, experts, and also the public about various topics. A study of sentiment analysis of newspaper sources during COVID-19 for selected countries can give an overview of how the media covered the pandemic. In this study, we select The Guardian newspaper and provide a sentiment analysis during various stages of COVID-19 that includes initial transmission, lockdowns and vaccination. We employ novel large language models (LLMs) and refine them with expert-labelled sentiment analysis data. We also provide an analysis of sentiments experienced pre-pandemic for comparison. The results indicate that during the early pandemic stages, public sentiment prioritised urgent crisis response, later shifting focus to addressing the impact on health and the economy. In comparison with related studies about social media sentiment analyses, we found a discrepancy between The Guardian with dominance of negative sentiments (sad, annoyed, anxious and denial), suggesting that social media offers a more diversified emotional reflection. We found a grim narrative in The Guardian with overall dominance of negative sentiments, pre and during COVID-19 across news sections including Australia, UK, World News, and Opinion</p></details> |  |

This paper presents Long Input Fine-Tuning (LIFT), a novel framework for long-context modeling that can improve the long-context performance of arbitrary (short-context) LLMs by dynamically adapting model parameters based on the long input. Importantly, LIFT, rather than endlessly extending the context window size to accommodate increasingly longer inputs in context, chooses to store and absorb the long input in parameter. By fine-tuning the long input into model parameters, LIFT allows short-context LLMs to answer questions even when the required information is not provided in the context during inference. Furthermore, to enhance LIFT performance while maintaining the original in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, we introduce Gated Memory, a specialized attention adapter that automatically balances long input memorization and ICL. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations of LIFT on long context understanding, offering valuable directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in automating and improving the accuracy of such summarizations due to their advanced natural language understanding capabilities. These models are particularly applicable in the context of summarizing medical/clinical texts, where precise and concise information transfer is essential. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of open-source LLMs in extracting key events from discharge reports, such as reasons for hospital admission, significant in-hospital events, and critical follow-up actions. In addition, we also assess the prevalence of various types of hallucinations in the summaries produced by these models. Detecting hallucinations is vital as it directly influences the reliability of the information, potentially affecting patient care and treatment outcomes. We conduct comprehensive numerical simulations to rigorously evaluate the performance of these models, further probing the accuracy and fidelity of the extracted content in clinical summarization.</p></details> |  |

The quality of these datasets plays a pivotal role in the performance of video generation models. We assert that temporal splitting, detailed captions, and video quality filtering are three crucial determinants of dataset quality. However, existing datasets exhibit various limitations in these areas. To address these challenges, we introduce Koala-36M, a large-scale, high-quality video dataset featuring accurate temporal splitting, detailed captions, and superior video quality. The essence of our approach lies in improving the consistency between fine-grained conditions and video content. Specifically, we employ a linear classifier on probability distributions to enhance the accuracy of transition detection, ensuring better temporal consistency. We then provide structured captions for the splitted videos, with an average length of 200 words, to improve text-video alignment. Additionally, we develop a Video Training Suitability Score (VTSS) that integrates multiple sub-metrics, allowing us to filter high-quality videos from the original corpus. Finally, we incorporate several metrics into the training process of the generation model, further refining the fine-grained conditions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our data processing pipeline and the quality of the proposed Koala-36M dataset. Our dataset and code have been released at https://koala36m.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025.

While prevailing methods attempt to address these issues through data augmentation and architecture modifications, they continue to struggle with processing long-form text inputs, and the inherent limitations of traditional CLIP text encoders lead to suboptimal downstream generalization. In this paper, we propose FLAME (Frozen Large lAnguage Models Enable data-efficient language-image pre-training) that leverages frozen large language models as text encoders, naturally processing long text inputs and demonstrating impressive multilingual generalization. FLAME comprises two key components: 1) a multifaceted prompt distillation technique for extracting diverse semantic representations from long captions, which better aligns with the multifaceted nature of images, and 2) a facet-decoupled attention mechanism, complemented by an offline embedding strategy, to ensure efficient computation. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate FLAME's superior performance. When trained on CC3M, FLAME surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 4.9% in ImageNet top-1 accuracy. On YFCC15M, FLAME surpasses the WIT-400M-trained CLIP by 44.4\% in average image-to-text recall@1 across 36 languages, and by 34.6% in text-to-image recall@1 for long-context retrieval on Urban-1k.

Magnetic shape memory (MSM) actuators with multi-stable transitions represent such untypical system plant with only the output displacement being measured. This paper provides a case study of designing the feedforward and feedback control system for an MSM-based actuator setup with a fairly high level of the output sensing noise. First, the recently introduced inversion-free feedforward hysteresis compensator is adapted for the Krasnoselskii-Pokrovskii operator model. Then, a robust feedback proportional-integral (PI) loop shaping is performed, while taking into account the lagging behavior of the low-pass filtering and system uncertainties. Experimental results show that the parallel action of feedforward and feedback parts improves the overall performance of position control.</p></details> | 6 pages, 11 figures |

However, identifying the precise synthesis conditions for specific MOFs within the vast array of possibilities presents a considerable challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to this problem. We leveraged the capabilities of LLMs, specifically gpt-4o-mini, as core agents to integrate various MOF-related agents, including synthesis, attribute, and chemical information agents. This integration culminated in the development of MOFh6, an LLM tool designed to streamline the MOF synthesis process. MOFh6 allows users to query in multiple formats, such as submitting scientific literature, or inquiring about specific MOF codes or structural properties. The tool analyzes these queries to provide optimal synthesis conditions and generates model files for density functional theory pre modeling. We believe MOFh6 will enhance efficiency in the MOF synthesis of all researchers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Dialogue Breakdown Detection: Addressing Disruptors in Large Language Models with Self-Guided Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18839v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly changing various domains. However, their capabilities in handling conversational breakdowns still require an in-depth exploration. This paper addresses the challenge of detecting and mitigating dialogue breakdowns within LLM-driven conversational systems. While powerful models from OpenAI and Anthropic excel in many dialogue tasks, they can still produce incoherent or contradictory responses, commonly referred to as breakdowns, which undermine user trust. To tackle this, we propose an approach that combines specialized fine-tuning with advanced prompting strategies, including few-shot learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, and analogical prompting. In particular, we fine-tune a small 8B model and demonstrate its robust classification and calibration capabilities in English and Japanese dialogue. We also validate its generalization on the BETOLD dataset, achieving a 7\% accuracy improvement over its base model. Furthermore, we introduce a real-time deployment architecture that selectively escalates suspicious responses to more resource-intensive frontier models only when breakdowns are detected, significantly cutting operational expenses and energy consumption. Experimental results show our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art specialized classifiers while also narrowing performance gaps between smaller open-source models and large proprietary ones. Our approach offers a scalable solution for robust conversational AI in high-impact domains by combining efficiency, interpretability, and reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Routing-Informed Placement for Large-Scale Photonic Integrated Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18813v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As technology advances, photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are rapidly scaling in size and complexity, with modern designs integrating thousands of components. However, the analog custom layout nature of photonics, the curvy waveguide structures, and single-layer routing resources impose stringent physical constraints, such as minimum bend radii and waveguide crossing penalties, which make manual layout the de facto standard. This manual process takes weeks to complete and is error-prone, which is fundamentally unscalable for large-scale PIC systems. Existing automation solutions have adopted force-directed placement on small benchmarks with tens of components, with limited routability and scalability. To fill this fundamental gap in the electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) toolchain, we present the first GPU-accelerated, routing-informed placement framework. It features an asymmetric bending-aware wirelength function with explicit modeling of waveguide routing congestion and crossings for routability maximization. Meanwhile, conditional projection is employed to gradually enforce a variety of user-defined layout constraints, including alignment, spacing, etc. This constrained optimization is accelerated and stabilized by a custom blockwise adaptive Nesterov-accelerated optimizer, ensuring stable and high-quality convergence. Compared to existing methods, our method can generate high-quality layouts for large-scale PICs with an average routing success rate of 94.79% across all benchmarks within minutes. By tightly coupling placement with physical-aware routing, our method establishes a new paradigm for automated PIC design, bringing intelligent, scalable layout synthesis to the forefront of next-generation EPDA. We will open-source our code.</p></details> |  |

Faulty machine detection is critical when an unexpected fault occurs in a machine. From our experience, a training task can encounter two faults per day on average, possibly leading to a halt for hours. To address the drawbacks of the time-consuming and labor-intensive manual scrutiny, we propose Minder, an automatic faulty machine detector for distributed training tasks. The key idea of Minder is to automatically and efficiently detect faulty distinctive monitoring metric patterns, which could last for a period before the entire training task comes to a halt. Minder has been deployed in our production environment for over one year, monitoring daily distributed training tasks where each involves up to thousands of machines. In our real-world fault detection scenarios, Minder can accurately and efficiently react to faults within 3.6 seconds on average, with a precision of 0.904 and F1-score of 0.893.</p></details> |  |

Through contrastive learning and multi-task optimization, ALF creates unified advertiser representations that capture both content and behavioral patterns. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on critical tasks including fraud detection, policy violation identification, and advertiser similarity matching. In production deployment, ALF reduces false positives by 90% while maintaining 99.8% precision on abuse detection tasks. The architecture's effectiveness stems from its novel combination of multi-modal transformations, inter-sample attention mechanism, spectrally normalized projections, and calibrated probabilistic outputs.</p></details> |  |

Traditional regex and entropy-based tools often generate high false positives due to limited contextual understanding. Aims: This work aims to enhance secret detection in source code using large language models (LLMs), reducing false positives while maintaining high recall. We also evaluate the feasibility of using fine-tuned, smaller models for local deployment. Method: We propose a hybrid approach combining regex-based candidate extraction with LLM-based classification. We evaluate pre-trained and fine-tuned variants of various Large Language Models on a benchmark dataset from 818 GitHub repositories. Various prompting strategies and efficient fine-tuning methods are employed for both binary and multiclass classification. Results: The fine-tuned LLaMA-3.1 8B model achieved an F1-score of 0.9852 in binary classification, outperforming regex-only baselines. For multiclass classification, Mistral-7B reached 0.982 accuracy. Fine-tuning significantly improved performance across all models. Conclusions: Fine-tuned LLMs offer an effective and scalable solution for secret detection, greatly reducing false positives. Open-source models provide a practical alternative to commercial APIs, enabling secure and cost-efficient deployment in development workflows.</p></details> |  |

While methods such as LoRA impose orthogonality constraints at the weight level, they do not fully address interference in hidden-state representations. We propose Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning (CS-ReFT), a novel representation-based approach that learns multiple orthonormal subspace transformations, each specializing in a distinct skill, and composes them via a lightweight router. By isolating these subspace edits in the hidden state, rather than weight matrices, CS-ReFT prevents cross-task conflicts more effectively. On the AlpacaEval benchmark, applying CS-ReFT to Llama-2-7B achieves a 93.94% win rate, surpassing GPT-3.5 Turbo (86.30%) while requiring only 0.0098% of model parameters. These findings show that specialized representation edits, composed via a simple router, significantly enhance multi-task instruction following with minimal overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 SCOPE</p></details> |

Unlike single-turn jailbreaks that rely on one meticulously engineered prompt, Siege expands the conversation at each turn in a breadth-first fashion, branching out multiple adversarial prompts that exploit partial compliance from previous responses. By tracking these incremental policy leaks and re-injecting them into subsequent queries, Siege reveals how minor concessions can accumulate into fully disallowed outputs. Evaluations on the JailbreakBench dataset show that Siege achieves a 100% success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo and 97% on GPT-4 in a single multi-turn run, using fewer queries than baselines such as Crescendo or GOAT. This tree search methodology offers an in-depth view of how model safeguards degrade over successive dialogue turns, underscoring the urgency of robust multi-turn testing procedures for language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 Trustworthy LLM</p></details> |

The skeptical thinking of humankind could be useful for LLMs to self-cognition, self-reflection and alleviate their hallucinations. Inspired by this consideration, we propose a novel approach called LaMsS, which combines the semantic understanding capability of LLMs with self-skepticism. By introducing a series of skepticism tokens and augmenting them into the vocabulary, we conduct both pertaining and finetuning, which allow the LLM to decode each normal token followed by a skeptical token, representing different skepticism levels. By calculating the response skepticism given a query, one can define a new self-aware LLM which is only willing to answer with relative lower skepticism level than the threshold. By examining the accuracy, AUC and AP of willingly answering questions, we demonstrate that LaMsS achieves better performance than baselines on both multi-choice questions and open-domain question-answering benchmarks, and can generalize to multi-task and out-of-domain settings. Our study sheds some lights on the self-skepticism modeling on further artificial intelligence.

However, such data -- sometimes referred to as citizen science data -- are opportunistic and lack a structured sampling strategy. This volunteer-collected biodiversity data contains geographic, temporal, taxonomic, observers, and sociopolitical biases that can have significant effects on biodiversity model performance, but whose impacts are unclear for fine-grained species recognition performance. Here we introduce Diversity Shift (DivShift), a framework for quantifying the effects of domain-specific distribution shifts on machine learning model performance. To diagnose the performance effects of biases specific to volunteer-collected biodiversity data, we also introduce DivShift - North American West Coast (DivShift-NAWC), a curated dataset of almost 7.5 million iNaturalist images across the western coast of North America partitioned across five types of expert-verified bias. We compare species recognition performance across these bias partitions using a diverse variety of species- and ecosystem-focused accuracy metrics. We observe that these biases confound model performance less than expected from the underlying label distribution shift, and that more data leads to better model performance but the magnitude of these improvements are bias-specific. These findings imply that while the structure within natural world images provides generalization improvements for biodiversity monitoring tasks, the biases present in volunteer-collected biodiversity data can also affect model performance; thus these models should be used with caution in downstream biodiversity monitoring tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at AAAI-25 AI for Social Impact Track (https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/35060) Presented at NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning (https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2024/43)</p></details> |

Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) automates the process. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in general domains, their effectiveness in BioNLP tasks remains unclear due to limited benchmarks and practical guidelines. We perform a systematic evaluation of four LLMs, GPT and LLaMA representatives on 12 BioNLP benchmarks across six applications. We compare their zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning performance with traditional fine-tuning of BERT or BART models. We examine inconsistencies, missing information, hallucinations, and perform cost analysis. Here we show that traditional fine-tuning outperforms zero or few shot LLMs in most tasks. However, closed-source LLMs like GPT-4 excel in reasoning-related tasks such as medical question answering. Open source LLMs still require fine-tuning to close performance gaps. We find issues like missing information and hallucinations in LLM outputs. These results offer practical insights for applying LLMs in BioNLP.</p></details> |  |

The dynamic nature of tax regulations poses a significant challenge to accurately and timely maintaining tax software artifacts. The state-of-the-art in maintaining tax prep software is time-consuming and error-prone as it involves manual code analysis combined with an expert interpretation of tax law amendments.

However, this task is often challenging due to the diversity of scenes, large number of fine-grained objects, and complex free-form nature of language references. Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of natural language training data is difficult. Thus, it is important for methods to learn from little data and zero-shot generalize to new environments. To address these challenges, we propose SORT3D, an approach that utilizes rich object attributes from 2D data and merges a heuristics-based spatial reasoning toolbox with the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform sequential reasoning. Importantly, our method does not require text-to-3D data for training and can be applied zero-shot to unseen environments. We show that SORT3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex view-dependent grounding tasks on two benchmarks. We also implement the pipeline to run real-time on an autonomous vehicle and demonstrate that our approach can be used for object-goal navigation on previously unseen real-world environments.

However, many critiques focus on cognitive abilities that, in humans, are distinct from language processing. Here, we instead study a kind of understanding tightly linked to language: inferring who did what to whom (thematic roles) in a sentence. Does the central training objective of LLMs-word prediction-result in sentence representations that capture thematic roles? In two experiments, we characterized sentence representations in four LLMs. In contrast to human similarity judgments, in LLMs the overall representational similarity of sentence pairs reflected syntactic similarity but not whether their agent and patient assignments were identical vs. reversed. Furthermore, we found little evidence that thematic role information was available in any subset of hidden units. However, some attention heads robustly captured thematic roles, independently of syntax. Therefore, LLMs can extract thematic roles but, relative to humans, this information influences their representations more weakly.</p></details> |  |

Manually maintaining these names becomes increasingly difficult when dealing with thousands of scientific names. To address this issue, this paper investigates the use of ChatGPT-4 to automate the development of the :Organism module in the Agricultural Product Types Ontology (APTO) for species classification. Our methodology involved leveraging ChatGPT-4 to extract data from the GBIF Backbone API and generate OWL files for further integration in APTO. Two alternative approaches were explored: (1) issuing a series of prompts for ChatGPT-4 to execute tasks via the BrowserOP plugin and (2) directing ChatGPT-4 to design a Python algorithm to perform analogous tasks. Both approaches rely on a prompting method where we provide instructions, context, input data, and an output indicator. The first approach showed scalability limitations, while the second approach used the Python algorithm to overcome these challenges, but it struggled with typographical errors in data handling. This study highlights the potential of Large language models like ChatGPT-4 to streamline the management of species names in ontologies. Despite certain limitations, these tools offer promising advancements in automating taxonomy-related tasks and improving the efficiency of ontology development.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 6 Figures, accepted for publication in Data Intelligence</p></details> |

However, these general-domain MLLMs perform poorly in face perception tasks, often producing inaccurate or misleading responses to face-specific queries. To address this gap, we propose FaceInsight, the versatile face perception MLLM that provides fine-grained facial information. Our approach introduces visual-textual alignment of facial knowledge to model both uncertain dependencies and deterministic relationships among facial information, mitigating the limitations of language-driven reasoning. Additionally, we incorporate face segmentation maps as an auxiliary perceptual modality, enriching the visual input with localized structural cues to enhance semantic understanding. Comprehensive experiments and analyses across three face perception tasks demonstrate that FaceInsight consistently outperforms nine compared MLLMs under both training-free and fine-tuned settings.</p></details> |  |

However, the primary reliance of existing SR methods on collaborative data results in challenges such as the cold-start problem and sub-optimal performance. Concurrently, despite the proven effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), their integration into commercial recommender systems is impeded by issues such as high inference latency, incomplete capture of all distribution statistics, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we introduce a novel Pre-train, Align, and Disentangle (PAD) framework to enhance SR models with LLMs. In particular, we initially pre-train both the SR and LLM models to obtain collaborative and textual embeddings. Subsequently, we propose a characteristic recommendation-anchored alignment loss using multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy with Gaussian kernels. Lastly, a triple-experts architecture, comprising aligned and modality-specific experts with disentangled embeddings, is fine-tuned in a frequency-aware manner. Experimental results on three public datasets validate the efficacy of PAD, indicating substantial enhancements and compatibility with various SR backbone models, particularly for cold items.

Since understanding depends on the explainee's background and needs, recent research has focused on co-constructive explanation dialogues, where the explainer continuously monitors the explainee's understanding and adapts explanations dynamically. We investigate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to engage as explainers in co-constructive explanation dialogues. In particular, we present a user study in which explainees interact with LLMs, of which some have been instructed to explain a predefined topic co-constructively. We evaluate the explainees' understanding before and after the dialogue, as well as their perception of the LLMs' co-constructive behavior. Our results indicate that current LLMs show some co-constructive behaviors, such as asking verification questions, that foster the explainees' engagement and can improve understanding of a topic. However, their ability to effectively monitor the current understanding and scaffold the explanations accordingly remains limited.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the SIGDial Conference 2025</p></details> |

These tasks often require substantial human effort to evaluate each alternative's performance, making them time-consuming and costly. Motivated by recent advances in large language models (LLMs), particularly their ability to generate outputs that align well with human evaluations, we consider an LLM-as-human-evaluator approach for conducting screening virtually, thereby reducing the cost burden. To achieve scalability and cost-effectiveness in virtual screening, we identify that the stochastic nature of LLM outputs and their cost structure necessitate efficient budget allocation across all alternatives. To address this, we propose using a top-$m$ greedy evaluation mechanism, a simple yet effective approach that keeps evaluating the current top-$m$ alternatives, and design the explore-first top-$m$ greedy (EFG-$m$) algorithm. We prove that EFG-$m$ is both sample-optimal and consistent in large-scale virtual screening. Surprisingly, we also uncover a bonus ranking effect, where the algorithm naturally induces an indifference-based ranking within the selected subset. To further enhance practicality, we design a suite of algorithm variants to improve screening performance and computational efficiency. Numerical experiments validate our results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms. Lastly, we conduct a case study on LLM-based virtual screening. The study shows that while LLMs alone may not provide meaningful screening and ranking results when directly queried, integrating them with our sample-optimal algorithms unlocks their potential for cost-effective, large-scale virtual screening.</p></details> |  |

Despite the impressive capabilities of large Vision Language Models (VLMs), it remains unclear how well they possess the geometric understanding required for practical applications in visual perception. In this work, we focus on evaluating the geometric understanding of these models, specifically targeting their ability to perceive the depth and height of objects in an image. To address this, we introduce GeoMeter, a suite of benchmark datasets - encompassing 2D and 3D scenarios - to rigorously evaluate these aspects. By benchmarking 18 state-of-the-art VLMs, we found that although they excel in perceiving basic geometric properties like shape and size, they consistently struggle with depth and height perception. Our analysis reveal that these challenges stem from shortcomings in their depth and height reasoning capabilities and inherent biases. This study aims to pave the way for developing VLMs with enhanced geometric understanding by emphasizing depth and height perception as critical components necessary for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPRW 2025.

| **[The Moral Mind(s) of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04476v3)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) increasingly participate in tasks with ethical and societal stakes, a critical question arises: do they exhibit an emergent "moral mind" - a consistent structure of moral preferences guiding their decisions - and to what extent is this structure shared across models? To investigate this, we applied tools from revealed preference theory to nearly 40 leading LLMs, presenting each with many structured moral dilemmas spanning five foundational dimensions of ethical reasoning. Using a probabilistic rationality test, we found that at least one model from each major provider exhibited behavior consistent with approximately stable moral preferences, acting as if guided by an underlying utility function. We then estimated these utility functions and found that most models cluster around neutral moral stances. To further characterize heterogeneity, we employed a non-parametric permutation approach, constructing a probabilistic similarity network based on revealed preference patterns. The results reveal a shared core in LLMs' moral reasoning, but also meaningful variation: some models show flexible reasoning across perspectives, while others adhere to more rigid ethical profiles. These findings provide a new empirical lens for evaluating moral consistency in LLMs and offer a framework for benchmarking ethical alignment across AI systems.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a novel system architecture that incorporates spatial speech understanding into LLMs, enabling contextually aware and adaptive applications for wearable technologies. Our approach leverages microstructure-based spatial sensing to extract precise Direction of Arrival (DoA) information using a monaural microphone. To address the lack of existing dataset for microstructure-assisted speech recordings, we synthetically create a dataset called OmniTalk by using the LibriSpeech dataset. This spatial information is fused with linguistic embeddings from OpenAI's Whisper model, allowing each modality to learn complementary contextual representations. The fused embeddings are aligned with the input space of LLaMA-3.2 3B model and fine-tuned with lightweight adaptation technique LoRA to optimize for on-device processing. SING supports spatially-aware automatic speech recognition (ASR), achieving a mean error of $25.72^\circ$-a substantial improvement compared to the 88.52$^\circ$ median error in existing work-with a word error rate (WER) of 5.3. SING also supports soundscaping, for example, inference how many people were talking and their directions, with up to 5 people and a median DoA error of 16$^\circ$. Our system demonstrates superior performance in spatial speech understanding while addressing the challenges of power efficiency, privacy, and hardware constraints, paving the way for advanced applications in augmented reality, accessibility, and immersive experiences.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepDistill: Enhancing LLM Reasoning Capabilities via Large-Scale Difficulty-Graded Data Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17565v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance on various complex reasoning benchmarks, the academic community still lacks an in-depth understanding of base model training processes and data quality. To address this, we construct a large-scale, difficulty-graded reasoning dataset containing approximately 3.34 million unique queries of varying difficulty levels and about 40 million distilled responses generated by multiple models over several passes. Leveraging pass rate and Coefficient of Variation (CV), we precisely select the most valuable training data to enhance reasoning capability. Notably, we observe a training pattern shift, indicating that reasoning-focused training based on base models requires higher learning rates for effective training. Using this carefully selected data, we significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of the base model, achieving a pass rate of 79.2\% on the AIME2024 mathematical reasoning benchmark. This result surpasses most current distilled models and closely approaches state-of-the-art performance. We provide detailed descriptions of our data processing, difficulty assessment, and training methodology, and have publicly released all datasets and methods to promote rapid progress in open-source long-reasoning LLMs. The dataset is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/a-m-team/AM-DeepSeek-Distilled-40M</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridge the Domains: Large Language Models Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18383v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) aims to extract the preference from the user's historical interactions across various domains. Despite some progress in CDSR, two problems set the barrier for further advancements, i.e., overlap dilemma and transition complexity. The former means existing CDSR methods severely rely on users who own interactions on all domains to learn cross-domain item relationships, compromising the practicability. The latter refers to the difficulties in learning the complex transition patterns from the mixed behavior sequences. With powerful representation and reasoning abilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are promising to address these two problems by bridging the items and capturing the user's preferences from a semantic view. Therefore, we propose an LLMs Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation model (LLM4CDSR). To obtain the semantic item relationships, we first propose an LLM-based unified representation module to represent items. Then, a trainable adapter with contrastive regularization is designed to adapt the CDSR task. Besides, a hierarchical LLMs profiling module is designed to summarize user cross-domain preferences. Finally, these two modules are integrated into the proposed tri-thread framework to derive recommendations. We have conducted extensive experiments on three public cross-domain datasets, validating the effectiveness of LLM4CDSR. We have released the code online.</p></details> | accepted by SIGIR'25 |

However, these LLM-Integrated Applications (LIA) expand the attack surface and introduce new kinds of threats. Threat modeling is commonly used to identify these threats and suggest mitigations. However, it is a time-consuming practice that requires the involvement of a security practitioner. Our goals are to 1) provide a method for performing threat modeling for LIAs early in their lifecycle, (2) develop a threat modeling tool that integrates existing threat models, and (3) ensure high-quality threat modeling. To achieve the goals, we work in collaboration with our industry partner. Our proposed way of performing threat modeling will benefit industry by requiring fewer security experts' participation and reducing the time spent on this activity. Our proposed tool combines LLMs and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and uses sources such as existing threat models and application architecture repositories to continuously create and update threat models. We propose to evaluate the tool offline -- i.e., using benchmarking -- and online with practitioners in the field. We conducted an early evaluation using ChatGPT on a simple LIA and obtained results that encouraged us to proceed with our research efforts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Data Auditing in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18349v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the surge of large language models (LLMs), Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs)--which integrate vision encoders with LLMs for accurate visual grounding--have shown great potential in tasks like generalist agents and robotic control. However, VLMs are typically trained on massive web-scraped images, raising concerns over copyright infringement and privacy violations, and making data auditing increasingly urgent. Membership inference (MI), which determines whether a sample was used in training, has emerged as a key auditing technique, with promising results on open-source VLMs like LLaVA (AUC > 80%). In this work, we revisit these advances and uncover a critical issue: current MI benchmarks suffer from distribution shifts between member and non-member images, introducing shortcut cues that inflate MI performance. We further analyze the nature of these shifts and propose a principled metric based on optimal transport to quantify the distribution discrepancy. To evaluate MI in realistic settings, we construct new benchmarks with i.i.d. member and non-member images. Existing MI methods fail under these unbiased conditions, performing only marginally better than chance. Further, we explore the theoretical upper bound of MI by probing the Bayes Optimality within the VLM's embedding space and find the irreducible error rate remains high. Despite this pessimistic outlook, we analyze why MI for VLMs is particularly challenging and identify three practical scenarios--fine-tuning, access to ground-truth texts, and set-based inference--where auditing becomes feasible. Our study presents a systematic view of the limits and opportunities of MI for VLMs, providing guidance for future efforts in trustworthy data auditing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing Uncertainty Measurement and Mitigation Methods for Large Language Models: A Systematic Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18346v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been transformative across many domains. However, hallucination -- confidently outputting incorrect information -- remains one of the leading challenges for LLMs. This raises the question of how to accurately assess and quantify the uncertainty of LLMs. Extensive literature on traditional models has explored Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to measure uncertainty and employed calibration techniques to address the misalignment between uncertainty and accuracy. While some of these methods have been adapted for LLMs, the literature lacks an in-depth analysis of their effectiveness and does not offer a comprehensive benchmark to enable insightful comparison among existing solutions. In this work, we fill this gap via a systematic survey of representative prior works on UQ and calibration for LLMs and introduce a rigorous benchmark. Using two widely used reliability datasets, we empirically evaluate six related methods, which justify the significant findings of our review. Finally, we provide outlooks for key future directions and outline open challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first dedicated study to review the calibration methods and relevant metrics for LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, a significant challenge remains in applying these models for the more intricate task of story visualization. Since it requires resolving pronouns (he, she, they) in the frame descriptions, i.e., anaphora resolution, and ensuring consistent characters and background synthesis across frames. Yet, the emerging Large Language Model (LLM) showcases robust reasoning abilities to navigate through ambiguous references and process extensive sequences. Therefore, we introduce \emph{StoryGPT-V}, which leverages the merits of the latent diffusion (LDM) and LLM to produce images with consistent and high-quality characters grounded on given story descriptions. First, we train a character-aware LDM, which takes character-augmented semantic embedding as input and includes the supervision of the cross-attention map using character segmentation masks, aiming to enhance character generation accuracy and faithfulness. In the second stage, we enable an alignment between the output of LLM and the character-augmented embedding residing in the input space of the first-stage model. This harnesses the reasoning ability of LLM to address ambiguous references and the comprehension capability to memorize the context. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two visual story visualization benchmarks. Our model reports superior quantitative results and consistently generates accurate characters of remarkable quality with low memory consumption.

Publicly released benchmarks inevitably become contaminated once incorporated into subsequent LLM training sets, undermining their reliability as faithful assessments. To address this, we introduce KUMO, a generative evaluation framework designed specifically for assessing reasoning in LLMs. KUMO synergistically combines LLMs with symbolic engines to dynamically produce diverse, multi-turn reasoning tasks that are partially observable and adjustable in difficulty. Through an automated pipeline, KUMO continuously generates novel tasks across open-ended domains, compelling models to demonstrate genuine generalization rather than memorization. We evaluated 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on 5,000 tasks across 100 domains created by KUMO, benchmarking their reasoning abilities against university students. Our findings reveal that many LLMs have outperformed university-level performance on easy reasoning tasks, and reasoning-scaled LLMs reach university-level performance on complex reasoning challenges. Moreover, LLM performance on KUMO tasks correlates strongly with results on newly released real-world reasoning benchmarks, underscoring KUMO's value as a robust, enduring assessment tool for genuine LLM reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the Intersecting Block Graph (IBG), a low-rank factorization of large directed graphs based on combinations of intersecting bipartite components, each consisting of a pair of communities, for source and target nodes. By giving less weight to non-edges, we show how to efficiently approximate any graph, sparse or dense, by a dense IBG. Specifically, we prove a constructive version of the weak regularity lemma, showing that for any chosen accuracy, every graph, regardless of its size or sparsity, can be approximated by a dense IBG whose rank depends only on the accuracy. This dependence of the rank solely on the accuracy, and not on the sparsity level, is in contrast to previous forms of the weak regularity lemma. We present a graph neural network architecture operating on the IBG representation of the graph and demonstrating competitive performance on node classification, spatio-temporal graph analysis, and knowledge graph completion, while having memory and computational complexity linear in the number of nodes rather than edges.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, a large language model (LLM)- enabled antenna modeling method, called LEAM, is presented to address this challenge. LEAM enables automatic antenna model generation based on language descriptions via prompt input, images, descriptions from academic papers, patents, and technical reports (either one or multiple). The effectiveness of LEAM is demonstrated by three examples: a Vivaldi antenna generated from a complete user description, a slotted patch antenna generated from an incomplete user description and the operating frequency, and a monopole slotted antenna generated from images and descriptions scanned from the literature. For all the examples, correct antenna models are generated in a few minutes.

However, existing methods have not fully capitalized on the potential of LLMs, often constrained by limited input information or failing to fully utilize their advanced reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce EXP3RT, a novel LLM-based recommender designed to leverage rich preference information contained in user and item reviews. EXP3RT is basically fine-tuned through distillation from a teacher LLM to perform three key tasks in order: EXP3RT first extracts and encapsulates essential subjective preferences from raw reviews, aggregates and summarizes them according to specific criteria to create user and item profiles. It then generates detailed step-by-step reasoning followed by predicted rating, i.e., reasoning-enhanced rating prediction, by considering both subjective and objective information from user/item profiles and item descriptions. This personalized preference reasoning from EXP3RT enhances rating prediction accuracy and also provides faithful and reasonable explanations for recommendation. Extensive experiments show that EXP3RT outperforms existing methods on both rating prediction and candidate item reranking for top-k recommendation, while significantly enhancing the explainability of recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

| **[Data-Driven Calibration of Prediction Sets in Large Vision-Language Models Based on Inductive Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17671v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses the critical challenge of hallucination mitigation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks through a Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) framework. While LVLMs excel in multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under user-defined risk levels ($\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous control of \textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain strictly below $\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes inversely with $\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces theoretical guarantees across all $\alpha$ values. The framework achieves stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios, underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems, offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware decision-making.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Rate-Constrained Training (BackSlash), a novel training-time compression approach based on rate-distortion optimization (RDO). BackSlash enables a flexible trade-off between model accuracy and complexity, significantly reducing parameter redundancy while preserving performance. Experiments in various architectures and tasks demonstrate that BackSlash can reduce memory usage by 60% - 90% without accuracy loss and provides significant compression gain compared to compression after training. Moreover, BackSlash proves to be highly versatile: it enhances generalization with small Lagrange multipliers, improves model robustness to pruning (maintaining accuracy even at 80% pruning rates), and enables network simplification for accelerated inference on edge devices.</p></details> |  |

While System 1 excels in quick, heuristic decisions, System 2 relies on logical reasoning for more accurate judgments and reduced biases. Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities. This survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs and the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their combination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to construct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling advanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally, we provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison of the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time \href{https://github.com/zzli2022/Awesome-Slow-Reason-System}{GitHub Repository} to track the latest developments.

In this work, we introduce ActionArt, a fine-grained video-caption dataset designed to advance research in human-centric multimodal understanding. Our dataset comprises thousands of videos capturing a broad spectrum of human actions, human-object interactions, and diverse scenarios, each accompanied by detailed annotations that meticulously label every limb movement. We develop eight sub-tasks to evaluate the fine-grained understanding capabilities of existing large multimodal models across different dimensions. Experimental results indicate that, while current large multimodal models perform commendably on various tasks, they often fall short in achieving fine-grained understanding. We attribute this limitation to the scarcity of meticulously annotated data, which is both costly and difficult to scale manually. Since manual annotations are costly and hard to scale, we propose proxy tasks to enhance the model perception ability in both spatial and temporal dimensions. These proxy tasks are carefully crafted to be driven by data automatically generated from existing MLLMs, thereby reducing the reliance on costly manual labels. Experimental results show that the proposed proxy tasks significantly narrow the gap toward the performance achieved with manually annotated fine-grained data.</p></details> |  |

Through extensive experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses or matches multiple baseline methods in the classification task of fact-check-worthiness estimation assessment, including classical pre-trained models such as BERT, as well as recent popular large models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Experiments show that the prompt tuning-based method proposed in this study exhibits certain advantages in evaluation metrics such as F1 score and accuracy, thereby effectively validating its effectiveness and advancement in the task of fact-check-worthiness estimation.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising capabilities in temporal grounding and video understanding, soccer commentary generation often requires precise temporal localization and semantically rich descriptions over long-form video. However, existing soccer MLLMs often rely on the temporal a priori for caption generation, so they cannot process the soccer video end-to-end. While some traditional approaches follow a two-step paradigm that is complex and fails to capture the global context to achieve suboptimal performance. To solve the above issues, we present TimeSoccer, the first end-to-end soccer MLLM for Single-anchor Dense Video Captioning (SDVC) in full-match soccer videos. TimeSoccer jointly predicts timestamps and generates captions in a single pass, enabling global context modeling across 45-minute matches. To support long video understanding of soccer matches, we introduce MoFA-Select, a training-free, motion-aware frame compression module that adaptively selects representative frames via a coarse-to-fine strategy, and incorporates complementary training paradigms to strengthen the model's ability to handle long temporal sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TimeSoccer achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on the SDVC task in an end-to-end form, generating high-quality commentary with accurate temporal alignment and strong semantic relevance.</p></details> |  |

But how much can we trust this generated text? In this paper, we study the problem of uncertainty quantification in LLMs. We propose a novel Random-Set Large Language Model (RSLLM) approach which predicts finite random sets (belief functions) over the token space, rather than probability vectors as in classical LLMs. In order to allow so efficiently, we also present a methodology based on hierarchical clustering to extract and use a budget of "focal" subsets of tokens upon which the belief prediction is defined, rather than using all possible collections of tokens, making the method scalable yet effective. RS-LLMs encode the epistemic uncertainty induced in their generation process by the size and diversity of its training set via the size of the credal sets associated with the predicted belief functions. The proposed approach is evaluated on CoQA and OBQA datasets using Llama2-7b, Mistral-7b and Phi-2 models and is shown to outperform the standard model in both datasets in terms of correctness of answer while also showing potential in estimating the second level uncertainty in its predictions and providing the capability to detect when its hallucinating.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

Our approach enhances HOI detection by not only predicting the standard triplets but also introducing quadruplets, which extend HOI triplets by including segmentation masks for human-object pairs. More specifically, Seg2HOI inherits the properties of the vision foundation model (e.g., promptable and interactive mechanisms) and incorporates a decoder that applies these attributes to HOI task. Despite training only for HOI, without additional training mechanisms for these properties, the framework demonstrates that such features still operate efficiently. Extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate that Seg2HOI achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods, even in zero-shot scenarios. Lastly, we propose that Seg2HOI can generate HOI quadruplets and interactive HOI segmentation from novel text and visual prompts that were not used during training, making it versatile for a wide range of applications by leveraging this flexibility.</p></details> |  |

CBMs work by first mapping inputs (e.g., images) to high-level concepts (e.g., visible objects and their properties) and then use these to solve a downstream task (e.g., tagging or scoring an image) in an interpretable manner. Their performance and interpretability, however, hinge on the quality of the concepts they learn. The go-to strategy for ensuring good quality concepts is to leverage expert annotations, which are expensive to collect and seldom available in applications. Researchers have recently addressed this issue by introducing "VLM-CBM" architectures that replace manual annotations with weak supervision from foundation models. It is however unclear what is the impact of doing so on the quality of the learned concepts. To answer this question, we put state-of-the-art VLM-CBMs to the test, analyzing their learned concepts empirically using a selection of significant metrics. Our results show that, depending on the task, VLM supervision can sensibly differ from expert annotations, and that concept accuracy and quality are not strongly correlated.

However, the use of logic in the context of both human and machine reasoning is typically through the dual 'reductive' perspective: collections of sufficient premisses are generated from putative conclusions. We call this paradigm, 'reductive logic'. This expression of logic encompass as diverse reasoning activities as proving a formula in a formal system to seeking to meet a friend before noon on Saturday. This paper is a semantical analysis of reductive logic. In particular, we provide mathematical foundations for representing and reasoning about 'reduction operators'. Heuristically, reduction operators may be thought of as `backwards' inference rules. In this paper, we address their mathematical representation, how they are used in the context of reductive reasoning, and, crucially, what makes them 'valid'.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Multimodal Physiological Foundation Models: Handling Arbitrary Missing Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19596v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal physiological signals, such as EEG, ECG, EOG, and EMG, are crucial for healthcare and brain-computer interfaces. While existing methods rely on specialized architectures and dataset-specific fusion strategies, they struggle to learn universal representations that generalize across datasets and handle missing modalities at inference time. To address these issues, we propose PhysioOmni, a foundation model for multimodal physiological signal analysis that models both homogeneous and heterogeneous features to decouple multimodal signals and extract generic representations while maintaining compatibility with arbitrary missing modalities. PhysioOmni trains a decoupled multimodal tokenizer, enabling masked signal pre-training via modality-invariant and modality-specific objectives. To ensure adaptability to diverse and incomplete modality combinations, the pre-trained encoders undergo resilient fine-tuning with prototype alignment on downstream datasets. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks, emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, motor prediction, and mental workload detection, demonstrate that PhysioOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining strong robustness to missing modalities. Our code and model weights will be released.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Towards Faster and More Compact Foundation Models for Molecular Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19538v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in machine learning for molecular property prediction have improved accuracy but at the expense of higher computational cost and longer training times. Recently, the Joint Multi-domain Pre-training (JMP) foundation model has demonstrated strong performance across various downstream tasks with reduced training time over previous models. Despite JMP's advantages, fine-tuning it on molecular datasets ranging from small-scale to large-scale requires considerable time and computational resources. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance efficiency by reducing model size while preserving performance. To better understand the model's efficiency, we analyze the layer contributions of JMP and find that later interaction blocks provide diminishing returns, suggesting an opportunity for model compression. We explore block reduction strategies by pruning the pre-trained model and evaluating its impact on efficiency and accuracy during fine-tuning. Our analysis reveals that removing two interaction blocks results in a minimal performance drop, reducing the model size by 32% while increasing inference throughput by 1.3x. These results suggest that JMP-L is over-parameterized and that a smaller, more efficient variant can achieve comparable performance with lower computational cost. Our study provides insights for developing lighter, faster, and more scalable foundation models for molecular and materials discovery. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Yasir-Ghunaim/efficient-jmp.</p></details> |  |

However, their widespread adoption raises critical concerns regarding trustworthiness across dimensions. This paper presents a comprehensive framework to address these challenges through three key contributions. First, we systematically review global AI governance laws and policies from governments and regulatory bodies, as well as industry practices and standards. Based on this analysis, we propose a set of guiding principles for GenFMs, developed through extensive multidisciplinary collaboration that integrates technical, ethical, legal, and societal perspectives. Second, we introduce TrustGen, the first dynamic benchmarking platform designed to evaluate trustworthiness across multiple dimensions and model types, including text-to-image, large language, and vision-language models. TrustGen leverages modular components--metadata curation, test case generation, and contextual variation--to enable adaptive and iterative assessments, overcoming the limitations of static evaluation methods. Using TrustGen, we reveal significant progress in trustworthiness while identifying persistent challenges. Finally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the challenges and future directions for trustworthy GenFMs, which reveals the complex, evolving nature of trustworthiness, highlighting the nuanced trade-offs between utility and trustworthiness, and consideration for various downstream applications, identifying persistent challenges and providing a strategic roadmap for future research. This work establishes a holistic framework for advancing trustworthiness in GenAI, paving the way for safer and more responsible integration of GenFMs into critical applications. To facilitate advancement in the community, we release the toolkit for dynamic evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches for adapting foundation models to new applications often rely on Federated Learning (FL) and disclose the foundation model weights to clients when using it to initialize the global model. While these methods ensure client data privacy, they compromise model and information security. In this paper, we introduce Federated Learning Aggregation Biased by a Foundation Model (FedBaF), a novel method for dynamically integrating pre-trained foundation model weights during the FL aggregation phase. Unlike conventional methods, FedBaF preserves the confidentiality of the foundation model while still leveraging its power to train more accurate models, especially in non-IID and adversarial scenarios. Our comprehensive experiments use Pre-ResNet and foundation models like Vision Transformer to demonstrate that FedBaF not only matches, but often surpasses the test accuracy of traditional weight initialization methods by up to 11.4% in IID and up to 15.8% in non-IID settings. Additionally, FedBaF applied to a Transformer-based language model significantly reduced perplexity by up to 39.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published at The 28th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[The Convergent Ethics of AI? Analyzing Moral Foundation Priorities in Large Language Models with a Multi-Framework Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19255v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in consequential decision-making contexts, systematically assessing their ethical reasoning capabilities becomes a critical imperative. This paper introduces the Priorities in Reasoning and Intrinsic Moral Evaluation (PRIME) framework--a comprehensive methodology for analyzing moral priorities across foundational ethical dimensions including consequentialist-deontological reasoning, moral foundations theory, and Kohlberg's developmental stages. We apply this framework to six leading LLMs through a dual-protocol approach combining direct questioning and response analysis to established ethical dilemmas. Our analysis reveals striking patterns of convergence: all evaluated models demonstrate strong prioritization of care/harm and fairness/cheating foundations while consistently underweighting authority, loyalty, and sanctity dimensions. Through detailed examination of confidence metrics, response reluctance patterns, and reasoning consistency, we establish that contemporary LLMs (1) produce decisive ethical judgments, (2) demonstrate notable cross-model alignment in moral decision-making, and (3) generally correspond with empirically established human moral preferences. This research contributes a scalable, extensible methodology for ethical benchmarking while highlighting both the promising capabilities and systematic limitations in current AI moral reasoning architectures--insights critical for responsible development as these systems assume increasingly significant societal roles.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |

However, recently, language and multi-modal foundational models have been used to replace and scale-up human annotator's efforts. This study explores the similarity between human-generated and ML-generated annotations of images across diverse socio-economic contexts (RQ1) and their impact on ML model performance and bias (RQ2). We aim to understand differences in perception and identify potential biases in content interpretation. Our dataset comprises images of people from various geographical regions and income levels, covering various daily activities and home environments. ML captions and human labels show highest similarity at a low-level, i.e., types of words that appear and sentence structures, but all annotations are consistent in how they perceive images across regions. ML Captions resulted in best overall region classification performance, while ML Objects and ML Captions performed best overall for income regression. ML annotations worked best for action categories, while human input was more effective for non-action categories. These findings highlight the notion that both human and machine annotations are important, and that human-generated annotations are yet to be replaceable.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (including references), 5 figures, 5 tables, and a paper/ethics checklist.

While current multimodal biomedical foundation models prioritize performance, their black-box nature hinders explaining the decision-making process in clinically meaningful concepts. Here, we present ConceptCLIP, the first explainable biomedical foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy while delivering human-interpretable explanations across diverse imaging modalities. We curate MedConcept-23M, the largest pre-training dataset comprising 23 million image-text-concept triplets across diverse medical modalities, where clinical concepts are derived from the Unified Medical Language System. Leveraging this dataset, we develop ConceptCLIP through a novel dual-alignment approach that simultaneously learns global image-text representations and fine-grained region-concept associations for precise and interpretable medical image analysis. We curate the most extensive evaluation benchmark for multimodal biomedical foundation models, covering 52 clinical tasks spanning 10 imaging modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConceptCLIP outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal biomedical foundation models. Importantly, ConceptCLIP demonstrates superior diagnostic performance while providing human-understandable explanations validated by clinical experts. As the first precise and interpretable biomedical foundation model, ConceptCLIP represents a critical milestone toward the widespread clinical adoption of AI, thereby advancing trustworthy AI in medicine.</p></details> |  |

Through contrastive learning and multi-task optimization, ALF creates unified advertiser representations that capture both content and behavioral patterns. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on critical tasks including fraud detection, policy violation identification, and advertiser similarity matching. In production deployment, ALF reduces false positives by 90% while maintaining 99.8% precision on abuse detection tasks.

| **[Toward Foundation Models for Online Complex Event Detection in CPS-IoT: A Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12282v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex events (CEs) play a crucial role in CPS-IoT applications, enabling high-level decision-making in domains such as smart monitoring and autonomous systems. However, most existing models focus on short-span perception tasks, lacking the long-term reasoning required for CE detection. CEs consist of sequences of short-time atomic events (AEs) governed by spatiotemporal dependencies. Detecting them is difficult due to long, noisy sensor data and the challenge of filtering out irrelevant AEs while capturing meaningful patterns. This work explores CE detection as a case study for CPS-IoT foundation models capable of long-term reasoning. We evaluate three approaches: (1) leveraging large language models (LLMs), (2) employing various neural architectures that learn CE rules from data, and (3) adopting a neurosymbolic approach that integrates neural models with symbolic engines embedding human knowledge. Our results show that the state-space model, Mamba, which belongs to the second category, outperforms all methods in accuracy and generalization to longer, unseen sensor traces. These findings suggest that state-space models could be a strong backbone for CPS-IoT foundation models for long-span reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundations of Safe Online Reinforcement Learning in the Linear Quadratic Regulator: $\sqrt{T}$-Regret](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18657v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how to efficiently learn while adhering to safety constraints is essential for using online reinforcement learning in practical applications. However, proving rigorous regret bounds for safety-constrained reinforcement learning is difficult due to the complex interaction between safety, exploration, and exploitation. In this work, we seek to establish foundations for safety-constrained reinforcement learning by studying the canonical problem of controlling a one-dimensional linear dynamical system with unknown dynamics. We study the safety-constrained version of this problem, where the state must with high probability stay within a safe region, and we provide the first safe algorithm that achieves regret of $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$. Furthermore, the regret is with respect to the baseline of truncated linear controllers, a natural baseline of non-linear controllers that are well-suited for safety-constrained linear systems. In addition to introducing this new baseline, we also prove several desirable continuity properties of the optimal controller in this baseline. In showing our main result, we prove that whenever the constraints impact the optimal controller, the non-linearity of our controller class leads to a faster rate of learning than in the unconstrained setting.</p></details> |  |

In the field of geophysics, although the application of foundation models is gradually expanding, there is currently a lack of comprehensive reviews discussing the full workflow of integrating foundation models with geophysical data. To address this gap, this paper presents a complete framework that systematically explores the entire process of developing foundation models in conjunction with geophysical data. From data collection and preprocessing to model architecture selection, pre-training strategies, and model deployment, we provide a detailed analysis of the key techniques and methodologies at each stage. In particular, considering the diversity, complexity, and physical consistency constraints of geophysical data, we discuss targeted solutions to address these challenges. Furthermore, we discuss how to leverage the transfer learning capabilities of foundation models to reduce reliance on labeled data, enhance computational efficiency, and incorporate physical constraints into model training, thereby improving physical consistency and interpretability. Through a comprehensive summary and analysis of the current technological landscape, this paper not only fills the gap in the geophysics domain regarding a full-process review of foundation models but also offers valuable practical guidance for their application in geophysical data analysis, driving innovation and advancement in the field.</p></details> |  |

This trend has extended to respiratory and heart sound models, which have demonstrated effectiveness as off-the-shelf feature extractors. However, their evaluation benchmarking has been limited, resulting in incompatibility with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, thus hindering proof of their effectiveness. This study investigates the practical effectiveness of off-the-shelf audio foundation models by comparing their performance across four respiratory and heart sound tasks with SOTA fine-tuning results. Experiments show that models struggled on two tasks with noisy data but achieved SOTA performance on the other tasks with clean data. Moreover, general-purpose audio models outperformed a respiratory sound model, highlighting their broader applicability. With gained insights and the released code, we contribute to future research on developing and leveraging foundation models for respiratory and heart sounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 figure, and 4 tables.

A key goal for SBI is to achieve accurate inference with as few simulations as possible, especially for expensive simulators. In this work, we address this challenge by repurposing recent probabilistic foundation models for tabular data: We show how tabular foundation models -- specifically TabPFN -- can be used as pre-trained autoregressive conditional density estimators for SBI. We propose Neural Posterior Estimation with Prior-data Fitted Networks (NPE-PF) and show that it is competitive with current SBI approaches in terms of accuracy for both benchmark tasks and two complex scientific inverse problems. Crucially, it often substantially outperforms them in terms of simulation efficiency, sometimes requiring orders of magnitude fewer simulations. NPE-PF eliminates the need for inference network selection, training, and hyperparameter tuning. We also show that it exhibits superior robustness to model misspecification and can be scaled to simulation budgets that exceed the context size limit of TabPFN. NPE-PF provides a new direction for SBI, where training-free, general-purpose inference models offer efficient, easy-to-use, and flexible solutions for a wide range of stochastic inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

These models are distinguished by their scalability and the ease with which they can be adapted through the exploitation of Transfer Learning. The availability of high computational power and large datasets have supported their development, achieving a high generalization capacity due to the enormous and heterogeneous amounts of data used in their initial training. These characteristics contribute to a solid base that can be adapted or adjusted to a wide range of tasks, increasing their applicability. This study proposes the methodology LLIAM, a straightforward adaptation of a kind of FM, Large Language Models, for the Time Series Forecasting task. An adequate time-series prompting schema and Low-Rank Adaptations are used to enhance the knowledge of the model with diverse time series datasets, known as the fine-tuning phase. A study divided in two stages has been performed for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Initially, a comparison was made between the performance of LLIAM and different state-of-the-art DL algorithms, including Recurrent Neural Networks and Temporal Convolutional Networks, as well as a LLM-based method, TimeLLM. Following this, a zero-shot study is presented in order to evaluate the generalization capacity of the proposed methodology with time series datasets from unknown domains not considered in the model training. The outcomes of this investigation demonstrate the efficacy of LLIAM, highlighting that this straightforward and general approach can attain competent results without the necessity for applying complex modifications. This work also encourages the use of available resources (such as these pre-trained models) and efficient fine-tuning techniques to avoid unnecessary and costly training, narrowing the gap between the goals of traditional AI and Green AI.</p></details> |  |

Our method utilizes multi-modal models to identify material types and initialize material parameters through image queries, while simultaneously inferring 3D Gaussian splats for detailed scene representation. We further refine these material parameters using video diffusion with a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) and optical flow guidance rather than render loss or Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. This integrated framework enables accurate prediction and realistic simulation of dynamic interactions in real-world scenarios, advancing both accuracy and flexibility in physics-based simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

In this context, foundation models facilitate remote sensing image analysis to retrieve relevant geoinformation accurately and efficiently. However, as these models grow in size, fine-tuning becomes increasingly challenging due to the associated computational resources and costs, limiting their accessibility and scalability. Furthermore, full fine-tuning can lead to forgetting pre-trained features and even degrade model generalization. To address this, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques offer a promising solution. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments with various foundation model architectures and PEFT techniques to evaluate their effectiveness on five different EO datasets. Our results provide a comprehensive comparison, offering insights into when and how PEFT methods support the adaptation of pre-trained geospatial models. We demonstrate that PEFT techniques match or even exceed full fine-tuning performance and enhance model generalisation to unseen geographic regions, while reducing training time and memory requirements. Additional experiments investigate the effect of architecture choices such as the decoder type or the use of metadata, suggesting UNet decoders and fine-tuning without metadata as the recommended configuration. We have integrated all evaluated foundation models and techniques into the open-source package TerraTorch to support quick, scalable, and cost-effective model adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/IBM/peft-geofm</p></details> |

The Earth observation (EO) field has produced several foundation models pre-trained directly on multispectral satellite imagery for applications like precision agriculture, wildfire and drought monitoring, and natural disaster response. However, few studies have investigated the ability of these models to generalize to new geographic locations, and potential concerns of geospatial bias -- models trained on data-rich developed nations not transferring well to data-scarce developing nations -- remain. We investigate the ability of popular EO foundation models to transfer to new geographic regions in the agricultural domain, where differences in farming practices and class imbalance make transfer learning particularly challenging. We first select five crop classification datasets across five continents, normalizing for dataset size and harmonizing classes to focus on four major cereal grains: maize, soybean, rice, and wheat. We then compare three popular foundation models, pre-trained on SSL4EO-S12, SatlasPretrain, and ImageNet, using in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation. Experiments show that pre-trained weights designed explicitly for Sentinel-2, such as SSL4EO-S12, outperform general pre-trained weights like ImageNet. Furthermore, while only 100 labeled images are sufficient for achieving high overall accuracy, 900 images are required to achieve high average accuracy due to class imbalance. All harmonized datasets and experimental code are open-source and available for download.</p></details> |  |

Real-world challenges like occlusion and non-texture hinder accurate disparity estimation from binocular matching cues. Recently, monocular relative depth estimation has shown remarkable generalization using vision foundation models. Thus, to facilitate robust stereo matching with monocular depth cues, we incorporate a robust monocular relative depth model into the recurrent stereo-matching framework, building a new framework for depth foundation model-based stereo-matching, DEFOM-Stereo. In the feature extraction stage, we construct the combined context and matching feature encoder by integrating features from conventional CNNs and DEFOM. In the update stage, we use the depth predicted by DEFOM to initialize the recurrent disparity and introduce a scale update module to refine the disparity at the correct scale. DEFOM-Stereo is verified to have much stronger zero-shot generalization compared with SOTA methods. Moreover, DEFOM-Stereo achieves top performance on the KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, Middlebury, and ETH3D benchmarks, ranking $1^{st}$ on many metrics. In the joint evaluation under the robust vision challenge, our model simultaneously outperforms previous models on the individual benchmarks, further demonstrating its outstanding capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://insta360-research-team.github.io/DEFOM-Stereo/</p></details> |

Our approach leverages a state-of-the-art Vision Foundation Model (VFM) within an encoder-decoder architecture, incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to enhance feature integration. This design captures detailed global representations and preserves essential spectral characteristics, treating RGB-to-NIR translation as more than a simple domain transfer problem. A multi-scale PatchGAN discriminator ensures realistic image generation at various detail levels, while carefully designed loss functions couple global context understanding with local feature preservation. We performed experiments on the RANUS dataset to demonstrate Pix2Next's advantages in quantitative metrics and visual quality, improving the FID score by 34.81% compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of Pix2Next by showing improved performance on a downstream object detection task using generated NIR data to augment limited real NIR datasets. The proposed approach enables the scaling up of NIR datasets without additional data acquisition or annotation efforts, potentially accelerating advancements in NIR-based computer vision applications.</p></details> | 19 pages,12 figures |

Recent studies indicate that scaling-up and advanced design of the recommendation model can bring significant performance improvement. However, with a larger model scale, such prior studies have a significantly increasing gap from industry as they often neglect two fundamental challenges in industrial-scale applications. First, training and inference budgets are restricted for the model to be served, exceeding which may incur latency and impair user experience. Second, large-volume data arrive in a streaming mode with data distributions dynamically shifting, as new users/ads join and existing users/ads leave the system. We propose the External Large Foundation Model (ExFM) framework to address the overlooked challenges. Specifically, we develop external distillation and a data augmentation system (DAS) to control the computational cost of training/inference while maintaining high performance. We design the teacher in a way like a foundation model (FM) that can serve multiple students as vertical models (VMs) to amortize its building cost. We propose Auxiliary Head and Student Adapter to mitigate the data distribution gap between FM and VMs caused by the streaming data issue. Comprehensive experiments on internal industrial-scale applications and public datasets demonstrate significant performance gain by ExFM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the ACM Web Conference (WWW) 2025 Industrial Track as Oral Presentation</p></details> |

Notably, GFreeDet won the best overall method and the best fast method awards in the model-free 2D detection track at BOP Challenge 2024.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 CV4MR Workshop (citation style changed)</p></details> |
| **[A Survey of Foundation Model-Powered Recommender Systems: From Feature-Based, Generative to Agentic Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16420v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RS) have become essential in filtering information and personalizing content for users. RS techniques have traditionally relied on modeling interactions between users and items as well as the features of content using models specific to each task. The emergence of foundation models (FMs), large scale models trained on vast amounts of data such as GPT, LLaMA and CLIP, is reshaping the recommendation paradigm. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the Foundation Models for Recommender Systems (FM4RecSys), covering their integration in three paradigms: (1) Feature-Based augmentation of representations, (2) Generative recommendation approaches, and (3) Agentic interactive systems. We first review the data foundations of RS, from traditional explicit or implicit feedback to multimodal content sources. We then introduce FMs and their capabilities for representation learning, natural language understanding, and multi-modal reasoning in RS contexts. The core of the survey discusses how FMs enhance RS under different paradigms. Afterward, we examine FM applications in various recommendation tasks. Through an analysis of recent research, we highlight key opportunities that have been realized as well as challenges encountered. Finally, we outline open research directions and technical challenges for next-generation FM4RecSys. This survey not only reviews the state-of-the-art methods but also provides a critical analysis of the trade-offs among the feature-based, the generative, and the agentic paradigms, outlining key open issues and future research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[DP2FL: Dual Prompt Personalized Federated Learning in Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16357v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized federated learning (PFL) has garnered significant attention for its ability to address heterogeneous client data distributions while preserving data privacy. However, when local client data is limited, deep learning models often suffer from insufficient training, leading to suboptimal performance. Foundation models, such as CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), exhibit strong feature extraction capabilities and can alleviate this issue by fine-tuning on limited local data. Despite their potential, foundation models are rarely utilized in federated learning scenarios, and challenges related to integrating new clients remain largely unresolved. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual Prompt Personalized Federated Learning (DP2FL) framework, which introduces dual prompts and an adaptive aggregation strategy. DP2FL combines global task awareness with local data-driven insights, enabling local models to achieve effective generalization while remaining adaptable to specific data distributions. Moreover, DP2FL introduces a global model that enables prediction on new data sources and seamlessly integrates newly added clients without requiring retraining. Experimental results in highly heterogeneous environments validate the effectiveness of DP2FL's prompt design and aggregation strategy, underscoring the advantages of prediction on novel data sources and demonstrating the seamless integration of new clients into the federated learning framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[SignX: The Foundation Model for Sign Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16315v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complexity of sign language data processing brings many challenges. The current approach to recognition of ASL signs aims to translate RGB sign language videos through pose information into English-based ID glosses, which serve to uniquely identify ASL signs. Note that there is no shared convention for assigning such glosses to ASL signs, so it is essential that the same glossing conventions are used for all of the data in the datasets that are employed. This paper proposes SignX, a foundation model framework for sign recognition. It is a concise yet powerful framework applicable to multiple human activity recognition scenarios. First, we developed a Pose2Gloss component based on an inverse diffusion model, which contains a multi-track pose fusion layer that unifies five of the most powerful pose information sources--SMPLer-X, DWPose, Mediapipe, PrimeDepth, and Sapiens Segmentation--into a single latent pose representation. Second, we trained a Video2Pose module based on ViT that can directly convert raw video into signer pose representation. Through this 2-stage training framework, we enable sign language recognition models to be compatible with existing pose formats, laying the foundation for the common pose estimation necessary for sign recognition. Experimental results show that SignX can recognize signs from sign language video, producing predicted gloss representations with greater accuracy than has been reported in prior work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Survey of Video Diffusion Models: Foundations, Implementations, and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16081v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized video generation, offering superior temporal consistency and visual quality compared to traditional generative adversarial networks-based approaches. While this emerging field shows tremendous promise in applications, it faces significant challenges in motion consistency, computational efficiency, and ethical considerations. This survey provides a comprehensive review of diffusion-based video generation, examining its evolution, technical foundations, and practical applications. We present a systematic taxonomy of current methodologies, analyze architectural innovations and optimization strategies, and investigate applications across low-level vision tasks such as denoising and super-resolution. Additionally, we explore the synergies between diffusionbased video generation and related domains, including video representation learning, question answering, and retrieval. Compared to the existing surveys (Lei et al., 2024a;b; Melnik et al., 2024; Cao et al., 2023; Xing et al., 2024c) which focus on specific aspects of video generation, such as human video synthesis (Lei et al., 2024a) or long-form content generation (Lei et al., 2024b), our work provides a broader, more updated, and more fine-grained perspective on diffusion-based approaches with a special section for evaluation metrics, industry solutions, and training engineering techniques in video generation. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of diffusion models and video generation, providing insights into both the theoretical frameworks and practical implementations that drive this rapidly evolving field.

This is a practical and applicable problem in clinics and hospitals, as WSIs are large, require storage, processing, and transfer time. Training new models whenever new tasks are defined is time-consuming. Recent work has applied regularization- and rehearsal-based methods to this setting. However, the rise of vision-language foundation models that align diagnostic text with pathology images raises the question: are these models alone sufficient for lifelong WSI learning using zero-shot classification, or is further investigation into continual learning strategies needed to improve performance? To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare conventional continual-learning approaches with vision-language zero-shot classification for WSIs. Our source code and experimental results will be available soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, conference submission</p></details> |

As we grapple with explaining these systems, a fundamental question emerges: Are the difficulties we face merely temporary hurdles, awaiting more sophisticated analytical techniques, or do they stem from \emph{intrinsic barriers} deeply rooted in the nature of these large-scale models themselves? This paper delves into this critical question by examining the fundamental characteristics of DFMs and scrutinizing the limitations encountered by current explainability methods when confronted with this inherent challenge. We probe the feasibility of achieving satisfactory explanations and consider the implications for how we must approach the verification and governance of these powerful technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[WhisperFlow: speech foundation models in real time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11272v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech foundation models, such as OpenAI's Whisper, become the state of the art in speech understanding due to their strong accuracy and generalizability. Yet, their applications are mostly limited to processing pre-recorded speech, whereas processing of streaming speech, in particular doing it efficiently, remains rudimentary. Behind this inefficiency are multiple fundamental reasons: (1) speech foundation models are trained to process long, fixed-length voice inputs (often 30 seconds); (2) encoding each voice input requires encoding as many as 1,500 tokens with tens of transformer layers; (3) decoding each output entails an irregular, complex beam search. As such, streaming speech processing on resource-constrained client devices is more expensive than other AI tasks, e.g., text generation. To this end, we present a novel framework, WhisperFlow, which embodies both model and system optimizations. (1) Hush word as a short, learnable audio segment; appended to a voice input, a hush word gracefully stops the speech model from processing more input without hallucination; (2) Beam pruning, which aligns streaming audio buffers over time and reuses results from earlier decoding rounds, therefore significantly accelerating decoding; and (3) CPU/GPU pipelining, which not only maps to the encoding/decoding stages dynamically, but also tunes to an optimal resource ratio, respecting the encoding/decoding speed that varies across voice inputs, models, and hardware. We test WhisperFlow on commodity ARM platforms with 4-12 CPU cores and 10-30 GPU cores. It reduces per-word latency by 1.6x-4.7x to as low as 0.5 second, while seeing negligible accuracy degradation. On an entry-level MacBook Air, WhisperFlow can keep the per-word latency around 1 second, with the whole device drawing only 7 Watts in total.</p></details> |  |
| **[StableQuant: Layer Adaptive Post-Training Quantization for Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14915v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose StableQuant, a novel adaptive post-training quantization (PTQ) algorithm for widely used speech foundation models (SFMs). While PTQ has been successfully employed for compressing large language models (LLMs) due to its ability to bypass additional fine-tuning, directly applying these techniques to SFMs may not yield optimal results, as SFMs utilize distinct network architecture for feature extraction. StableQuant demonstrates optimal quantization performance regardless of the network architecture type, as it adaptively determines the quantization range for each layer by analyzing both the scale distributions and overall performance. We evaluate our algorithm on two SFMs, HuBERT and wav2vec2.0, for an automatic speech recognition (ASR) task, and achieve superior performance compared to traditional PTQ methods. StableQuant successfully reduces the sizes of SFM models to a quarter and doubles the inference speed while limiting the word error rate (WER) performance drop to less than 0.3% with 8-bit quantization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Satellite Federated Fine-Tuning for Foundation Models in Space Computing Power Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10403v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites have promoted the application of large remote sensing foundation models for various downstream tasks. However, direct downloading of these models for fine-tuning on the ground is impeded by privacy concerns and limited bandwidth. Satellite federated learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling model fine-tuning directly on-board satellites and aggregating model updates without data downloading. Nevertheless, for large foundation models, the computational capacity of satellites is insufficient to support effective on-board fine-tuning in traditional satellite FL frameworks. To address these challenges, we propose a satellite-ground collaborative federated fine-tuning framework. The key of the framework lies in how to reasonably decompose and allocate model components to alleviate insufficient on-board computation capabilities. During fine-tuning, satellites exchange intermediate results with ground stations or other satellites for forward propagation and back propagation, which brings communication challenges due to the special communication topology of space transmission networks, such as intermittent satellite-ground communication, short duration of satellite-ground communication windows, and unstable inter-orbit inter-satellite links (ISLs). To reduce transmission delays, we further introduce tailored communication strategies that integrate both communication and computing resources. Specifically, we propose a parallel intra-orbit communication strategy, a topology-aware satellite-ground communication strategy, and a latency-minimalization inter-orbit communication strategy to reduce space communication costs. Simulation results demonstrate significant reductions in training time with improvements of approximately 33%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Temporal Plasticity in Foundation Time Series Models for Incremental Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14677v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models excel at diverse time series forecasting tasks, but their capacity for continuous improvement through incremental learning remains unexplored. We present the first comprehensive study investigating these models' temporal plasticity - their ability to progressively enhance performance through continual learning while maintaining existing capabilities. Through experiments on real-world datasets exhibiting distribution shifts, we evaluate both conventional deep learning models and foundation models using a novel continual learning framework. Our findings reveal that while traditional models struggle with performance deterioration during incremental fine-tuning, foundation models like Time-MoE and Chronos demonstrate sustained improvement in predictive accuracy. This suggests that optimizing foundation model fine-tuning strategies may be more valuable than developing domain-specific small models. Our research introduces new evaluation methodologies and insights for developing foundation time series models with robust continuous learning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

To address these issues, this paper introduces communication-efficient federated LoRA adaption (CE-LoRA), a method that employs a tri-factorization low-rank adaptation approach with personalized model parameter aggregation. We first presents a novel LoRA parameter factorization by introducing a small-size dense matrix, which can significantly reduce the communication cost and achieve comparable empirical performance than transferring the low-rank parameter matrix used by existing methods. Without violating data privacy, the server considers the client similarity in both training dataset and model parameter space, and learns personalized weights for model aggregation. Our experiments on various LLM and VLM fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that CE-LoRA not only significantly reduces communication overhead but also improves performance under not independently and identically distributed data conditions. In addition, CE-LoRA improves data privacy protection, effectively mitigating gradient-based data reconstruction attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeaMo: A Season-Aware Multimodal Foundation Model for Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19237v2)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote Sensing (RS) data encapsulates rich multi-dimensional information essential for Earth observation. Its vast volume, diverse sources, and temporal continuity make it particularly well-suited for developing large Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). These models serve as powerful feature extractors, leveraging extensive RS data for pretraining and subsequent fine-tuning in various geoscientific applications. However, existing VFMs in the RS domain often concentrate on specific image characteristics, neglecting the full season-aware potential of RS data. To bridge this gap, we introduce SeaMo, a novel VFM that effectively integrates multimodal and multi-seasonal RS information. SeaMo leverages a masked image modeling framework to fully exploit the spatial, spectral, and seasonal dimensions of RS data. Specifically, we employ unaligned spatial region selection to capture spatial heterogeneity, incorporate multi-source inputs for enhanced multimodal integration, and introduce temporal-multimodal fusion blocks to assimilate seasonal variations effectively. By explicitly modeling the complex, season-dependent attributes of RS data, SeaMo enhances generalization, robustness, and adaptability across geoscientific tasks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate its superior performance, underscoring its potential as a foundational model for Earth observation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Foundation Models in Federated Learning: Assessing Backdoor Vulnerabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10375v3)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving machine learning framework, faces significant data-related challenges. For example, the lack of suitable public datasets leads to ineffective information exchange, especially in heterogeneous environments with uneven data distribution. Foundation Models (FMs) offer a promising solution by generating synthetic datasets that mimic client data distributions, aiding model initialization and knowledge sharing among clients. However, the interaction between FMs and FL introduces new attack vectors that remain largely unexplored. This work therefore assesses the backdoor vulnerabilities exploiting FMs, where attackers exploit safety issues in FMs and poison synthetic datasets to compromise the entire system. Unlike traditional attacks, these new threats are characterized by their one-time, external nature, requiring minimal involvement in FL training. Given these uniqueness, current FL defense strategies provide limited robustness against this novel attack approach. Extensive experiments across image and text domains reveal the high susceptibility of FL to these novel threats, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced security measures in FL in the era of FMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Xi Li...</summary><p>Xi Li and Chen Wu are equal contribution.

| **[Post-Hurricane Debris Segmentation Using Fine-Tuned Foundational Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12542v2)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and accurate detection of hurricane debris is critical for effective disaster response and community resilience. While post-disaster aerial imagery is readily available, robust debris segmentation solutions applicable across multiple disaster regions remain limited. Developing a generalized solution is challenging due to varying environmental and imaging conditions that alter debris' visual signatures across different regions, further compounded by the scarcity of training data. This study addresses these challenges by fine-tuning pre-trained foundational vision models, achieving robust performance with a relatively small, high-quality dataset. Specifically, this work introduces an open-source dataset comprising approximately 1,200 manually annotated aerial RGB images from Hurricanes Ian, Ida, and Ike. To mitigate human biases and enhance data quality, labels from multiple annotators are strategically aggregated and visual prompt engineering is employed. The resulting fine-tuned model, named fCLIPSeg, achieves a Dice score of 0.70 on data from Hurricane Ida -- a disaster event entirely excluded during training -- with virtually no false positives in debris-free areas. This work presents the first event-agnostic debris segmentation model requiring only standard RGB imagery during deployment, making it well-suited for rapid, large-scale post-disaster impact assessments and recovery planning.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Our proposed architecture combines a shared Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone with task-specific multi-layer perceptron (MLP) heads and incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. This design promotes full parameter sharing across tasks, significantly reducing the computational and memory footprint without sacrificing performance. The model processes both image-like wireless modalities, such as spectrograms and channel state information (CSI), and in-phase and quadrature (IQ) signals arranged as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) resource grids. We demonstrate the strong generalization capabilities of WavesFM through extensive experiments on four downstream tasks: Fifth Generation New Radio (5G NR) positioning; multiple-input multiple-output OFDM (MIMO-OFDM) channel estimation; human activity sensing; and radio-frequency (RF) signal classification. Compared to supervised baselines trained individually, our approach achieves superior performance while sharing 80% of its parameters across tasks. Furthermore, we show that pretraining on domain-relevant data not only boosts performance but also accelerates convergence, reducing training time by up to 5x. These results demonstrate that our unified WFM can support diverse tasks and deliver significant gains in both performance and efficiency, highlighting the transformative potential of foundation models to drive AI-native paradigms in future sixth-generation (6G) networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoftUp: Learning a Coordinate-Based Feature Upsampler for Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14032v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (VFMs) such as DINOv2 and CLIP have achieved impressive results on various downstream tasks, but their limited feature resolution hampers performance in applications requiring pixel-level understanding. Feature upsampling offers a promising direction to address this challenge. In this work, we identify two critical factors for enhancing feature upsampling: the upsampler architecture and the training objective. For the upsampler architecture, we introduce a coordinate-based cross-attention transformer that integrates the high-resolution images with coordinates and low-resolution VFM features to generate sharp, high-quality features. For the training objective, we propose constructing high-resolution pseudo-groundtruth features by leveraging class-agnostic masks and self-distillation. Our approach effectively captures fine-grained details and adapts flexibly to various input and feature resolutions. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing feature upsampling techniques across various downstream tasks.

However, such solutions are not yet available for Tetun, making it challenging to find relevant documents for text-based search queries in this language. To address these challenges, we investigate Tetun text retrieval with a focus on the ad-hoc retrieval task. The study begins by developing essential language resources -- including a list of stopwords, a stemmer, and a test collection -- which serve as foundational components for solutions tailored to Tetun text retrieval. Various strategies are investigated using both document titles and content to evaluate retrieval effectiveness. The results demonstrate that retrieving document titles, after removing hyphens and apostrophes without applying stemming, significantly improves retrieval performance compared to the baseline. Efficiency increases by 31.37%, while effectiveness achieves an average relative gain of +9.40% in MAP@10 and +30.35% in NDCG@10 with DFR BM25. Beyond the top-10 cutoff point, Hiemstra LM shows strong performance across various retrieval strategies and evaluation metrics. Contributions of this work include the development of Labadain-Stopwords (a list of 160 Tetun stopwords), Labadain-Stemmer (a Tetun stemmer with three variants), and Labadain-Avaliad\'or (a Tetun test collection containing 59 topics, 33,550 documents, and 5,900 qrels). We make all resources publicly accessible to facilitate future research in Tetun information retrieval.</p></details> | Version 3 |
| **[Towards Cardiac MRI Foundation Models: Comprehensive Visual-Tabular Representations for Whole-Heart Assessment and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13037v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive cardiac assessment, offering rich spatio-temporal views of the cardiac anatomy and physiology. Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic, and lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and disease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand cardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an individual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly exploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have begun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data and focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a comprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a comprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of individual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants, ViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling a complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with detailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This multi-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including cardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and classification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified framework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging features and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific models toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health, highlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in cardiac analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Designing a reliable lateral movement detector using a graph foundation model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13527v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have recently emerged as a new paradigm in machine learning (ML). These models are pre-trained on large and diverse datasets and can subsequently be applied to various downstream tasks with little or no retraining. This allows people without advanced ML expertise to build ML applications, accelerating innovation across many fields. However, the adoption of foundation models in cybersecurity is hindered by their inability to efficiently process data such as network traffic captures or binary executables. The recent introduction of graph foundation models (GFMs) could make a significant difference, as graphs are well-suited to representing these types of data. We study the usability of GFMs in cybersecurity through the lens of one specific use case, namely lateral movement detection. Using a pre-trained GFM, we build a detector that reaches state-of-the-art performance without requiring any training on domain-specific data. This case study thus provides compelling evidence of the potential of GFMs for cybersecurity.</p></details> |  |

Although vision foundation models have achieved remarkable progress in classification and segmentation tasks, their application to physically interpretable regression remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the multi-spectral nature and geospatial heterogeneity of remote sensing data pose significant challenges for generalization and transferability. To address these issues, we introduce SatelliteCalculator, the first vision foundation model tailored for quantitative remote sensing inversion. By leveraging physically defined index formulas, we automatically construct a large-scale dataset of over one million paired samples across eight core ecological indicators. The model integrates a frozen Swin Transformer backbone with a prompt-guided architecture, featuring cross-attentive adapters and lightweight task-specific MLP decoders. Experiments on the Open-Canopy benchmark demonstrate that SatelliteCalculator achieves competitive accuracy across all tasks while significantly reducing inference cost. Our results validate the feasibility of applying foundation models to quantitative inversion, and provide a scalable framework for task-adaptive remote sensing estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CytoFM: The first cytology foundation model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13402v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cytology is essential for cancer diagnostics and screening due to its minimally invasive nature. However, the development of robust deep learning models for digital cytology is challenging due to the heterogeneity in staining and preparation methods of samples, differences across organs, and the limited availability of large, diverse, annotated datasets. Developing a task-specific model for every cytology application is impractical and non-cytology-specific foundation models struggle to generalize to tasks in this domain where the emphasis is on cell morphology. To address these challenges, we introduce CytoFM, the first cytology self-supervised foundation model. Using iBOT, a self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) training framework incorporating masked image modeling and self-distillation, we pretrain CytoFM on a diverse collection of cytology datasets to learn robust, transferable representations. We evaluate CytoFM on multiple downstream cytology tasks, including breast cancer classification and cell type identification, using an attention-based multiple instance learning framework. Our results demonstrate that CytoFM performs better on two out of three downstream tasks than existing foundation models pretrained on histopathology (UNI) or natural images (iBOT-Imagenet). Visualizations of learned representations demonstrate our model is able to attend to cytologically relevant features. Despite a small pre-training dataset, CytoFM's promising results highlight the ability of task-agnostic pre-training approaches to learn robust and generalizable features from cytology data.</p></details> |  |

However, AI security (i.e., the safeguarding of data, models, and pipelines from adversarial manipulation) underpins all of these efforts. This manuscript posits that AI security must be prioritized as a foundational layer. We present a hierarchical view of AI challenges, distinguishing security from safety, and argue for a security-first approach to enable trustworthy and resilient AI systems.

At present, the curse of dimensionality remains one of the major bottlenecks in high-dimensional multi-label learning, which can be effectively addressed through multi-label feature selection methods. However, existing multi-label feature selection methods mostly focus on identifying global features shared across all labels, which overlooks personalized characteristics and specific requirements of individual labels. This global-only perspective may limit the ability to capture label-specific discriminative information, thereby affecting overall performance. In this paper, we propose a novel method called GPMFS (Global Foundation and Personalized Optimization for Multi-Label Feature Selection). GPMFS firstly identifies global features by exploiting label correlations, then adaptively supplements each label with a personalized subset of discriminative features using a threshold-controlled strategy. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that GPMFS achieves superior performance while maintaining strong interpretability and robustness. Furthermore, GPMFS provides insights into the label-specific strength across different multi-label datasets, thereby demonstrating the necessity and potential applicability of personalized feature selection approaches.</p></details> |  |

While CLIP demonstrates remarkable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, the multi-modal feature spaces still suffer from a modality gap, which is a gap between image and text feature clusters and limits downstream task performance. Although existing works attempt to address the modality gap by modifying pre-training or fine-tuning, they struggle with heavy training costs with large datasets or degradations of zero-shot performance. This paper presents CLIP-Refine, a post-pre-training method for CLIP models at a phase between pre-training and fine-tuning. CLIP-Refine aims to align the feature space with 1 epoch training on small image-text datasets without zero-shot performance degradations. To this end, we introduce two techniques: random feature alignment (RaFA) and hybrid contrastive-distillation (HyCD). RaFA aligns the image and text features to follow a shared prior distribution by minimizing the distance to random reference vectors sampled from the prior. HyCD updates the model with hybrid soft labels generated by combining ground-truth image-text pair labels and outputs from the pre-trained CLIP model. This contributes to achieving both maintaining the past knowledge and learning new knowledge to align features. Our extensive experiments with multiple classification and retrieval tasks show that CLIP-Refine succeeds in mitigating the modality gap and improving the zero-shot performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025; Code: https://github.com/yshinya6/clip-refine</p></details> |

These can be used within data processing pipelines for machine learning tasks and numerical methods. We show how our GNPs can be trained to learn robust latent representations for the differential geometry of point-clouds to provide estimates of metric, curvature, and other shape-related features. We demonstrate how our pre-trained GNPs can be used (i) to estimate the geometric properties of surfaces of arbitrary shape and topologies with robustness in the presence of noise, (ii) to approximate solutions of geometric partial differential equations (PDEs) on manifolds, and (iii) to solve equations for shape deformations such as curvature driven flows. We release codes and weights for using GNPs in the package geo_neural_op. This allows for incorporating our pre-trained GNPs as components for reuse within existing and new data processing pipelines. The GNPs also can be used as part of numerical solvers involving geometry or as part of methods for performing inference and other geometric tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, addressing uncertainty in both perception (sensory interpretation) and decision-making (plan generation) remains a critical challenge for ensuring task reliability. We present a comprehensive framework to disentangle, quantify, and mitigate these two forms of uncertainty. We first introduce a framework for uncertainty disentanglement, isolating perception uncertainty arising from limitations in visual understanding and decision uncertainty relating to the robustness of generated plans. To quantify each type of uncertainty, we propose methods tailored to the unique properties of perception and decision-making: we use conformal prediction to calibrate perception uncertainty and introduce Formal-Methods-Driven Prediction (FMDP) to quantify decision uncertainty, leveraging formal verification techniques for theoretical guarantees. Building on this quantification, we implement two targeted intervention mechanisms: an active sensing process that dynamically re-observes high-uncertainty scenes to enhance visual input quality and an automated refinement procedure that fine-tunes the model on high-certainty data, improving its capability to meet task specifications. Empirical validation in real-world and simulated robotic tasks demonstrates that our uncertainty disentanglement framework reduces variability by up to 40% and enhances task success rates by 5% compared to baselines. These improvements are attributed to the combined effect of both interventions and highlight the importance of uncertainty disentanglement, which facilitates targeted interventions that enhance the robustness and reliability of autonomous systems.

We identify three key challenges for transceiver design: "hard to compute," "hard to model," and "hard to measure," and argue that AI can provide promising solutions. We propose three research roadmaps for AI algorithms tailored to THz UM-MIMO systems. The first, model-driven deep learning (DL), emphasizes leveraging domain knowledge and using AI to enhance bottleneck modules in established signal processing or optimization frameworks. We discuss four steps: algorithmic frameworks, basis algorithms, loss function design, and neural architecture design. The second roadmap presents channel station information (CSI) foundation models to unify transceiver module design by focusing on the wireless channel. We propose a compact foundation model to estimate wireless channel score functions, serving as a prior for designing transceiver modules. We outline four steps: general frameworks, conditioning, site-specific adaptation, and joint design of CSI models and model-driven DL. The third roadmap explores applying pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to THz UM-MIMO systems, with applications in estimation, optimization, searching, network management, and protocol understanding.

| **[You Don't Need All Attentions: Distributed Dynamic Fine-Tuning for Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12471v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning plays a crucial role in adapting models to downstream tasks with minimal training efforts. However, the rapidly increasing size of foundation models poses a daunting challenge for accommodating foundation model fine-tuning in most commercial devices, which often have limited memory bandwidth. Techniques like model sharding and tensor parallelism address this issue by distributing computation across multiple devices to meet memory requirements. Nevertheless, these methods do not fully leverage their foundation nature in facilitating the fine-tuning process, resulting in high computational costs and imbalanced workloads. We introduce a novel Distributed Dynamic Fine-Tuning (D2FT) framework that strategically orchestrates operations across attention modules based on our observation that not all attention modules are necessary for forward and backward propagation in fine-tuning foundation models. Through three innovative selection strategies, D2FT significantly reduces the computational workload required for fine-tuning foundation models. Furthermore, D2FT addresses workload imbalances in distributed computing environments by optimizing these selection strategies via multiple knapsack optimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed D2FT framework reduces the training computational costs by 40% and training communication costs by 50% with only 1% to 2% accuracy drops on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Stanford Cars datasets. Moreover, the results show that D2FT can be effectively extended to recent LoRA, a state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique. By reducing 40% computational cost or 50% communication cost, D2FT LoRA top-1 accuracy only drops 4% to 6% on Stanford Cars dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[A foundation for the distance sampling methodology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12439v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The population size ("abundance") of wildlife species has central interest in ecological research and management. Distance sampling is a dominant approach to the estimation of wildlife abundance for many vertebrate animal species. One perceived advantage of distance sampling over the well-known alternative approach of capture-recapture is that distance sampling is thought to be robust to unmodelled heterogeneity in animal detection probability, via a conjecture known as "pooling robustness". Although distance sampling has been successfully applied and developed for decades, its statistical foundation is not complete: there are published proofs and arguments highlighting deficiency of the methodology. This work provides a design-based statistical foundation for distance sampling that has attainable assumptions. In addition, because identification and consistency of the developed distance sampling abundance estimator is unaffected by detection heterogeneity, the pooling robustness conjecture is resolved.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Foundation Model for Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Multi-PDE Learning with Active Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07425v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws into neural network training. However, traditional PINN models are typically designed for single PDEs, limiting their generalizability across different physical systems. In this work, we explore the potential of a foundation PINN model capable of solving multiple PDEs within a unified architecture. We investigate the efficacy of a single PINN framework trained on four distinct PDEs-the Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO), the 1D Heat Equation, the 1D Wave Equation, and the 2D Laplace Equation, demonstrating its ability to learn diverse physical dynamics. To enhance sample efficiency, we incorporate Active Learning (AL) using Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout-based uncertainty estimation, selecting the most informative training samples iteratively. We evaluate different active learning strategies, comparing models trained on 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% of the full dataset, and analyze their impact on solution accuracy. Our results indicate that targeted uncertainty sampling significantly improves performance with fewer training samples, leading to efficient learning across multiple PDEs. This work highlights the feasibility of a generalizable PINN-based foundation model, capable of adapting to different physics-based problems without redesigning network architectures. Our findings suggest that multi-PDE PINNs with active learning can serve as an effective approach for reducing computational costs while maintaining high accuracy in physics-based deep learning applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper should be rewritten</p></details> |

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, providing significant advantages for Earth observation. However, establishing a foundation model for SAR image interpretation inevitably encounters the challenges of insufficient information utilization and poor interpretability. In this paper, we propose a remote sensing foundation model based on complex-valued SAR data, which simulates the polarimetric decomposition process for pre-training, i.e., characterizing pixel scattering intensity as a weighted combination of scattering bases and scattering coefficients, thereby endowing the foundation model with physical interpretability. Specifically, we construct a series of scattering queries, each representing an independent and meaningful scattering basis, which interact with SAR features in the scattering query decoder and output the corresponding scattering coefficient. To guide the pre-training process, polarimetric decomposition loss and power self-supervision loss are constructed. The former aligns the predicted coefficients with Yamaguchi coefficients, while the latter reconstructs power from the predicted coefficients and compares it to the input image's power. The performance of our foundation model is validated on six typical downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Notably, the foundation model can extract stable feature representations and exhibits strong generalization, even in data-scarce conditions.</p></details> |  |

Systems like Circom simplify ZK development by combining witness computation and circuit constraints in one program. However, even small errors can compromise security of ZK programs --under-constrained circuits may accept invalid witnesses, while over-constrained ones may reject valid ones. Static analyzers are often imprecise with high false positives, and formal tools struggle with real-world circuit scale. Additionally, existing tools overlook several critical behaviors, such as intermediate computations and program aborts, and thus miss many vulnerabilities. Our theoretical contribution is the Trace-Constraint Consistency Test (TCCT), a foundational language-independent formulation of ZK circuit bugs that defines bugs as discrepancies between the execution traces of the computation and the circuit constraints. TCCT captures both intermediate computations and program aborts, detecting bugs that elude prior tools. Our systems contribution is zkFuzz, a novel program mutation-based fuzzing framework for detecting TCCT violations. zkFuzz systematically mutates the computational logic of Zk programs guided by a novel fitness function, and injects carefully crafted inputs using tailored heuristics to expose bugs. We evaluated zkFuzz on 354 real-world ZK circuits written in Circom, a leading programming system for ZK development. zkFuzz successfully identified 66 bugs, including 38 zero-days --18 of which were confirmed by developers and 6 fixed, earning bug bounties.</p></details> |  |

However, how to effectively train the network without using real-world labels remains a challenging problem. In this paper, driven by the recent advancements of vision foundation models, a novel method termed DFM-MVS, is proposed to leverage the depth foundation model to generate the effective depth prior, so as to boost MVS in the absence of real-world labels. Specifically, a depth prior-based pseudo-supervised training mechanism is developed to simulate realistic stereo correspondences using the generated depth prior, thereby constructing effective supervision for the MVS network. Besides, a depth prior-guided error correction strategy is presented to leverage the depth prior as guidance to mitigate the error propagation problem inherent in the widely-used coarse-to-fine network structure. Experimental results on DTU and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that the proposed DFM-MVS significantly outperforms existing MVS methods without using real-world labels.</p></details> |  |

We conduct a comparative analysis on various approaches for sensing force, data collection, behavior cloning, tactile representation learning, and low-level robot control. From our analysis, we articulate when and why forces are needed, and highlight opportunities to improve learning of contact-rich, generalist robot policies on the path toward highly capable touch-based robot foundation models. We generally find that while there are few tasks such as pouring, peg-in-hole insertion, and handling delicate objects, the performance of imitation learning models is not at a level of dynamics where force truly matters. Also, force and touch are abstract quantities that can be inferred through a wide range of modalities and are often measured and controlled implicitly. We hope that juxtaposing the different approaches currently in use will help the reader to gain a systemic understanding and help inspire the next generation of robot foundation models.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

While DUSt3R and its successors have achieved breakthroughs in 3D reconstruction from unposed images, these methods exhibit significant limitations when scaling to multi-view scenarios, including high computational cost and cumulative error induced by global alignment. To address these challenges, we propose Regist3R, a novel stereo foundation model tailored for efficient and scalable incremental reconstruction. Regist3R leverages an incremental reconstruction paradigm, enabling large-scale 3D reconstructions from unordered and many-view image collections. We evaluate Regist3R on public datasets for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. Our experiments demonstrate that Regist3R achieves comparable performance with optimization-based methods while significantly improving computational efficiency, and outperforms existing multi-view reconstruction models. Furthermore, to assess its performance in real-world applications, we introduce a challenging oblique aerial dataset which has long spatial spans and hundreds of views. The results highlight the effectiveness of Regist3R. We also demonstrate the first attempt to reconstruct large-scale scenes encompassing over thousands of views through pointmap-based foundation models, showcasing its potential for practical applications in large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks, including urban modeling, aerial mapping, and beyond.</p></details> | 19 pages |

However, there is limited transparency into what drives the correlation between dataset size and performance, raising the question of whether simply adding more data to increase performance is always necessary. In this study, we propose a prototype-guided diffusion model to generate high-fidelity synthetic pathology data at scale, enabling large-scale self-supervised learning and reducing reliance on real patient samples while preserving downstream performance. Using guidance from histological prototypes during sampling, our approach ensures biologically and diagnostically meaningful variations in the generated data. We demonstrate that self-supervised features trained on our synthetic dataset achieve competitive performance despite using ~60x-760x less data than models trained on large real-world datasets. Notably, models trained using our synthetic data showed statistically comparable or better performance across multiple evaluation metrics and tasks, even when compared to models trained on orders of magnitude larger datasets. Our hybrid approach, combining synthetic and real data, further enhanced performance, achieving top results in several evaluations. These findings underscore the potential of generative AI to create compelling training data for digital pathology, significantly reducing the reliance on extensive clinical datasets and highlighting the efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry (REIMS), a tool for real-time intraoperative margin assessment, generates spectra that require machine learning models to support clinical decision-making. However, the scarcity of labeled data in surgical contexts presents a significant challenge. This study is the first to develop a foundation model tailored specifically for REIMS data, addressing this limitation and advancing real-time surgical margin assessment. Methods: We propose FACT, a Foundation model for Assessing Cancer Tissue margins. FACT is an adaptation of a foundation model originally designed for text-audio association, pretrained using our proposed supervised contrastive approach based on triplet loss. An ablation study is performed to compare our proposed model against other models and pretraining methods. Results: Our proposed model significantly improves the classification performance, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an AUROC of $82.4\% \pm 0.8$. The results demonstrate the advantage of our proposed pretraining method and selected backbone over the self-supervised and semi-supervised baselines and alternative models. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that foundation models, adapted and pretrained using our novel approach, can effectively classify REIMS data even with limited labeled examples. This highlights the viability of foundation models for enhancing real-time surgical margin assessment, particularly in data-scarce clinical environments.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advancements, existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they may require running an RL process on each downstream task to achieve a satisfactory performance, they may need access to datasets with good coverage or well-curated task-specific samples, or they may pre-train policies with unsupervised losses that are poorly correlated with the downstream tasks of interest. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm regularizing unsupervised RL towards imitating trajectories from unlabeled behavior datasets. The key technical novelty of our method, called Forward-Backward Representations with Conditional-Policy Regularization, is to train forward-backward representations to embed the unlabeled trajectories to the same latent space used to represent states, rewards, and policies, and use a latent-conditional discriminator to encourage policies to ``cover'' the states in the unlabeled behavior dataset. As a result, we can learn policies that are well aligned with the behaviors in the dataset, while retaining zero-shot generalization capabilities for reward-based and imitation tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach in a challenging humanoid control problem: leveraging observation-only motion capture datasets, we train Meta Motivo, the first humanoid behavioral foundation model that can be prompted to solve a variety of whole-body tasks, including motion tracking, goal reaching, and reward optimization. The resulting model is capable of expressing human-like behaviors and it achieves competitive performance with task-specific methods while outperforming state-of-the-art unsupervised RL and model-based baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, pretraining on such datasets introduces significant challenges due to substantial mismatches in data distributions, a problem particularly pronounced with time series data. In this paper, we tackle this issue by proposing a domain-aware adaptive normalization strategy within the Transformer architecture. Specifically, we replace the traditional LayerNorm with a prototype-guided dynamic normalization mechanism (ProtoNorm), where learned prototypes encapsulate distinct data distributions, and sample-to-prototype affinity determines the appropriate normalization layer. This mechanism effectively captures the heterogeneity of time series characteristics, aligning pretrained representations with downstream tasks. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional pretraining techniques across both classification and forecasting tasks, while effectively mitigating the adverse effects of distribution shifts during pretraining. Incorporating ProtoNorm is as simple as replacing a single line of code. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world time series benchmarks validate the robustness and generalizability of our approach, advancing the development of more versatile time series foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, existing DGSS methods often rely exclusively on either VFMs or VLMs, overlooking their complementary strengths. VFMs (e.g., DINOv2) excel at capturing fine-grained features, while VLMs (e.g., CLIP) provide robust text alignment but struggle with coarse granularity. Despite their complementary strengths, effectively integrating VFMs and VLMs with attention mechanisms is challenging, as the increased patch tokens complicate long-sequence modeling. To address this, we propose MFuser, a novel Mamba-based fusion framework that efficiently combines the strengths of VFMs and VLMs while maintaining linear scalability in sequence length. MFuser consists of two key components: MVFuser, which acts as a co-adapter to jointly fine-tune the two models by capturing both sequential and spatial dynamics; and MTEnhancer, a hybrid attention-Mamba module that refines text embeddings by incorporating image priors. Our approach achieves precise feature locality and strong text alignment without incurring significant computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MFuser significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS methods, achieving 68.20 mIoU on synthetic-to-real and 71.87 mIoU on real-to-real benchmarks.

However, due to the high computation complexity of adversarial training, it is not feasible to fine-tune the foundation model to improve its robustness on the downstream task. Observing the above challenge, we want to improve the downstream robustness without updating/accessing the weights in the foundation model. Inspired from existing literature in robustness inheritance (Kim et al., 2020), through theoretical investigation, we identify a close relationship between robust contrastive learning with the adversarial robustness of supervised learning. To further validate and utilize this theoretical insight, we design a simple-yet-effective robust auto-encoder as a data pre-processing method before feeding the data into the foundation model. The proposed approach has zero access to the foundation model when training the robust auto-encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the robustness of downstream tasks, verifying the connection between the feature robustness (implied by small adversarial contrastive loss) and the robustness of the downstream task.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 2 figures, 12 tables.

This is primarily due to the inherent data variability and diversity of downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel universal 3D pre-training framework designed to facilitate the acquisition of efficient 3D representation, thereby establishing a pathway to 3D foundational models. Considering that informative 3D features should encode rich geometry and appearance cues that can be utilized to render realistic images, we propose to learn 3D representations by differentiable neural rendering. We train a 3D backbone with a devised volumetric neural renderer by comparing the rendered with the real images. Notably, our approach seamlessly integrates the learned 3D encoder into various downstream tasks. These tasks encompass not only high-level challenges such as 3D detection and segmentation but also low-level objectives like 3D reconstruction and image synthesis, spanning both indoor and outdoor scenarios. Besides, we also illustrate the capability of pre-training a 2D backbone using the proposed methodology, surpassing conventional pre-training methods by a large margin. For the first time, PonderV2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 indoor and outdoor benchmarks, implying its effectiveness.

Video datasets, however, are often released as extracted features (i.e., tabular data) rather than raw footage due to privacy and ethical concerns. Prior research on such tabular datasets established tree-based classical machine learning approaches as the best-performing models. Motivated by the recent success of textual foundation models (i.e., large language models), we explore the use of tabular foundation models in empathy detection from tabular visual features. We experiment with two recent tabular foundation models $-$ TabPFN v2 and TabICL $-$ through in-context learning and fine-tuning setups. Our experiments on a public human-robot interaction benchmark demonstrate a significant boost in cross-subject empathy detection accuracy over several strong baselines (accuracy: $0.590 \rightarrow 0.730$; AUC: $0.564 \rightarrow 0.669$). In addition to performance improvement, we contribute novel insights and an evaluation setup to ensure generalisation on unseen subjects in this public benchmark. As the practice of releasing video features as tabular datasets is likely to persist due to privacy constraints, our findings will be widely applicable to future empathy detection video datasets as well.</p></details> |  |

These models facilitate the understanding of matter and the discovery of new molecules and materials. In contrast to GNNs operating on a large homogeneous graphs, GNNs used by CFMs process a large number of geometric graphs of varying sizes, requiring different optimization strategies than those developed for large homogeneous GNNs. This paper presents optimizations for two critical phases of CFM training: data distribution and model training, targeting MACE - a state-of-the-art CFM. We address the challenge of load balancing in data distribution by formulating it as a multi-objective bin packing problem. We propose an iterative algorithm that provides a highly effective, fast, and practical solution, ensuring efficient data distribution. For the training phase, we identify symmetric tensor contraction as the key computational kernel in MACE and optimize this kernel to improve the overall performance. Our combined approach of balanced data distribution and kernel optimization significantly enhances the training process of MACE. Experimental results demonstrate a substantial speedup, reducing per-epoch execution time for training from 12 to 2 minutes on 740 GPUs with a 2.6M sample dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The 34th ACM International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC 2025)</p></details> |

The success of these models can be attributed to their ability to effectively learn latent representations of atomic structures directly from the training data. Conversely, this also results in high data requirements for these models, hindering their application to problems which are data sparse which are common in this domain. To address this limitation, there is a growing development in the area of pre-trained machine learning models which have learned general, fundamental, geometric relationships in atomistic data, and which can then be fine-tuned to much smaller application-specific datasets. In particular, models which are pre-trained on diverse, large-scale atomistic datasets have shown impressive generalizability and flexibility to downstream applications, and are increasingly referred to as atomistic foundation models. To leverage the untapped potential of these foundation models, we introduce MatterTune, a modular and extensible framework that provides advanced fine-tuning capabilities and seamless integration of atomistic foundation models into downstream materials informatics and simulation workflows, thereby lowering the barriers to adoption and facilitating diverse applications in materials science. In its current state, MatterTune supports a number of state-of-the-art foundation models such as ORB, MatterSim, JMP, and EquformerV2, and hosts a wide range of features including a modular and flexible design, distributed and customizable fine-tuning, broad support for downstream informatics tasks, and more.</p></details> |  |

Our method addresses three critical requirements for effective training: precise 3D region segmentation, comprehensive textual descriptions, and sufficient dataset scale. By leveraging state-of-the-art open-vocabulary image segmentation models and region-aware Vision-Language Models, we develop an automatic pipeline that generates high-quality 3D mask-text pairs. Applying this pipeline to multiple 3D scene datasets, we create Mosaic3D-5.6M, a dataset of over 30K annotated scenes with 5.6M mask-text pairs, significantly larger than existing datasets. Building upon this data, we propose Mosaic3D, a foundation model combining a 3D encoder trained with contrastive learning and a lightweight mask decoder for open-vocabulary 3D semantic and instance segmentation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on open-vocabulary 3D semantic and instance segmentation tasks including ScanNet200, Matterport3D, and ScanNet++, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of our large-scale training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://nvlabs.github.io/Mosaic3D/</p></details> |

However, adapting these models to local health systems remains challenging due to limited data availability and resource constraints. In this study, we investigated what these models learn and evaluated the transferability of an FM trained on MIMIC-IV to an institutional EHR dataset at the University of Chicago Medical Center. We assessed their ability to identify outlier patients and examined representation-space patient trajectories in relation to future clinical outcomes. We also evaluated the performance of supervised fine-tuned classifiers on both source and target datasets. Our findings offer insights into the adaptability of FMs across different healthcare systems, highlight considerations for their effective implementation, and provide an empirical analysis of the underlying factors that contribute to their predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[CROSSAN: Towards Efficient and Effective Adaptation of Multiple Multimodal Foundation Models for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10307v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) excel at representing diverse raw modalities (e.g., text, images, audio, videos, etc.). As recommender systems increasingly incorporate these modalities, leveraging MFMs to generate better representations has great potential. However, their application in sequential recommendation remains largely unexplored. This is primarily because mainstream adaptation methods, such as Fine-Tuning and even Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques (e.g., Adapter and LoRA), incur high computational costs, especially when integrating multiple modality encoders, thus hindering research progress. As a result, it remains unclear whether we can efficiently and effectively adapt multiple (>2) MFMs for the sequential recommendation task. To address this, we propose a plug-and-play Cross-modal Side Adapter Network (CROSSAN). Leveraging the fully decoupled side adapter-based paradigm, CROSSAN achieves high efficiency while enabling cross-modal learning across diverse modalities. To optimize the final stage of multimodal fusion across diverse modalities, we adopt the Mixture of Modality Expert Fusion (MOMEF) mechanism. CROSSAN achieves superior performance on the public datasets for adapting four foundation models with raw modalities. Performance consistently improves as more MFMs are adapted. We will release our code and datasets to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  |

It explicitly models how meaning, interpretation, and analogy emerge from interactions among layered representations, forming a coherent framework capable not only of modeling minds but also of serving as a blueprint for building them. One of the key theoretical insights derived from function alignment is bounded interpretability, which provides a unified explanation for previously fragmented ideas in cognitive science, such as bounded rationality, symbol grounding, and analogy-making. Beyond modeling, the function alignment framework bridges disciplines often kept apart, linking computational architecture, psychological theory, and even contemplative traditions such as Zen. Rather than building on any philosophical systems, it offers a structural foundation upon which multiple ways of understanding the mind may be reconstructed.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures.

| **[Towards A Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model via Unified Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18449v3)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets are revolutionizing the field of computational pathology (CPath). The generalization ability of foundation models is crucial for the success in various downstream clinical tasks. However, current foundation models have only been evaluated on a limited type and number of tasks, leaving their generalization ability and overall performance unclear. To address this gap, we established a most comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf foundation models across six distinct clinical task types, encompassing a total of 72 specific tasks, including slide-level classification, survival prediction, ROI-tissue classification, ROI retrieval, visual question answering, and report generation. Our findings reveal that existing foundation models excel at certain task types but struggle to effectively handle the full breadth of clinical tasks. To improve the generalization of pathology foundation models, we propose a unified knowledge distillation framework consisting of both expert and self-knowledge distillation, where the former allows the model to learn from the knowledge of multiple expert models, while the latter leverages self-distillation to enable image representation learning via local-global alignment. Based on this framework, we curated a dataset of 96,000 whole slide images (WSIs) and developed a Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model (GPFM). This advanced model was trained on a substantial dataset comprising 190 million images extracted from approximately 72,000 publicly available slides, encompassing 34 major tissue types. Evaluated on the established benchmark, GPFM achieves an impressive average rank of 1.6, with 42 tasks ranked 1st, while the second-best model, UNI, attains an average rank of 3.7, with only 6 tasks ranked 1st.</p></details> | update |
| **[Enhancing Multi-task Learning Capability of Medical Generalist Foundation Model via Image-centric Multi-annotation Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09967v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of medical generalist foundation models has revolutionized conventional task-specific model development paradigms, aiming to better handle multiple tasks through joint training on large-scale medical datasets. However, recent advances prioritize simple data scaling or architectural component enhancement, while neglecting to re-examine multi-task learning from a data-centric perspective. Critically, simply aggregating existing data resources leads to decentralized image-task alignment, which fails to cultivate comprehensive image understanding or align with clinical needs for multi-dimensional image interpretation. In this paper, we introduce the image-centric multi-annotation X-ray dataset (IMAX), the first attempt to enhance the multi-task learning capabilities of medical multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) from the data construction level. To be specific, IMAX is featured from the following attributes: 1) High-quality data curation. A comprehensive collection of more than 354K entries applicable to seven different medical tasks. 2) Image-centric dense annotation. Each X-ray image is associated with an average of 4.10 tasks and 7.46 training entries, ensuring multi-task representation richness per image. Compared to the general decentralized multi-annotation X-ray dataset (DMAX), IMAX consistently demonstrates significant multi-task average performance gains ranging from 3.20% to 21.05% across seven open-source state-of-the-art medical MLLMs. Moreover, we investigate differences in statistical patterns exhibited by IMAX and DMAX training processes, exploring potential correlations between optimization dynamics and multi-task performance. Finally, leveraging the core concept of IMAX data construction, we propose an optimized DMAX-based training strategy to alleviate the dilemma of obtaining high-quality IMAX data in practical scenarios.</p></details> |  |

| **[OVERLORD: Ultimate Scaling of DataLoader for Multi-Source Large Foundation Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09844v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern frameworks for training large foundation models (LFMs) employ data loaders in a data parallel paradigm. While this design offers implementation simplicity, it introduces two fundamental challenges. First, due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention operator, the non-uniform sample distribution over data-parallel ranks leads to a significant workload imbalance among loaders, which degrades the training efficiency. This paradigm also impedes the implementation of data mixing algorithms (e.g., curriculum learning) over different datasets. Second, to acquire a broad range of capability, LFMs training ingests data from diverse sources, each with distinct file access states. Colocating massive datasets within loader instances can easily exceed local pod memory capacity. Additionally, heavy sources with higher transformation latency require larger worker pools, further exacerbating memory consumption. We present OVERLORD, an industrial-grade distributed data loading architecture with three innovations: (1) A centralized and declarative data plane, which facilitates elastic data orchestration strategy, such as long-short context, multimodal, and curriculum learning; (2) Disaggregated multisource preprocessing through role-specific actors, i.e., Source Loaders and Data Constructors, leveraging autoscaling for Source Loaders towards heterogeneous and evolving source preprocessing cost; (3) Shadow Loaders with differential checkpointing for uninterrupted fault recovery. Deployed on production clusters scaling to multi-thousand GPU, OVERLORD achieves: (1) 4.5x end-to-end training throughput improvement, (2) a minimum 3.6x reduction in CPU memory usage, with further improvements to be added in later experiments.</p></details> |  |

This entails equipping robots with the capability to plan actions over extended horizons while leveraging multi-modality to bridge gaps between high-level planning and actual task execution. Recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models have showcased substantial potential in enhancing planning and reasoning abilities, particularly in the comprehension and processing of semantic information for robotic control tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework based on foundation models that applies the embodied chain of action reasoning methodology to autonomously plan actions from textual instructions for humanoid loco-manipulation. Our method integrates humanoid-specific chain of thought methodology, including detailed affordance and body movement analysis, which provides a breakdown of the task into a sequence of locomotion and manipulation actions. Moreover, we incorporate spatial reasoning based on the observation and target object properties to effectively navigate where target position may be unseen or occluded. Through rigorous experimental setups on object rearrangement, manipulations and loco-manipulation tasks on a real-world environment, we evaluate our method's efficacy on the decoupled upper and lower body control and demonstrate the effectiveness of the chain of robotic action reasoning strategies in comprehending human instructions.</p></details> |  |

Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability.

Therefore, redefining modes of collaboration between devices and agents, and constructing native intelligence libraries become critically important in 6G. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of achieving 6G native AI from the perspectives of data, AI models, and operational paradigm. Then, we propose a 6G native AI framework based on foundation models, provide an integration method for the expert knowledge, present the customization for two kinds of PFM, and outline a novel operational paradigm for the native AI framework. As a practical use case, we apply this framework for orchestration, achieving the maximum sum rate within a cell-free massive MIMO system, and presenting preliminary evaluation results. Finally, we outline research directions for achieving native AI in 6G.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

However, existing pre-trained circuit models are typically limited to standalone encoders for predictive tasks or decoders for generative tasks. These two model types are developed independently, operate on different circuit modalities, and reside in separate latent spaces, which restricts their ability to complement each other for more advanced applications. In this work, we present GenEDA, the first framework that aligns circuit encoders with decoders within a shared latent space. GenEDA bridges the gap between graph-based circuit representations and text-based large language models (LLMs), enabling communication between their respective latent spaces. To achieve the alignment, we propose two paradigms that support both open-source trainable LLMs and commercial frozen LLMs. Built on this aligned architecture, GenEDA enables three unprecedented generative reasoning tasks over netlists, where the model reversely generates the high-level functionality from low-level netlists in different granularities. These tasks extend traditional gate-type prediction to direct generation of full-circuit functionality. Experiments demonstrate that GenEDA significantly boosts advanced LLMs' (e.g., GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3) performance in all tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> |

OCL's self-supervision of reconstructing the input from these aggregated slots struggles with complex object textures, thus Vision Foundation Model (VFM) representations are used as the aggregation input and reconstruction target. However, existing methods leverage VFM representations in diverse ways and often fail to fully exploit their potential. In response, we propose a clean architecture -- Vector-Quantized VFMs for OCL (VQ-VFM-OCL, or VVO) -- that unifies mainstream OCL methods. The key to our unification is simple yet effective, just shared quantizing the same VFM representation as the reconstruction target. Through mathematical modeling and statistical verification, we further analyze why VFM representations facilitate OCL aggregation and how their shared quantization as reconstruction targets strengthens OCL supervision. Experiments show that across different VFMs, aggregators and decoders, our VVO consistently outperforms baselines in object discovery and recognition, as well as downstream visual prediction and reasoning.

While current deep learning models excel at specific tasks like skin cancer diagnosis from dermoscopic images, they struggle to meet the complex, multimodal requirements of clinical practice. Here, we introduce PanDerm, a multimodal dermatology foundation model pretrained through self-supervised learning on over 2 million real-world skin disease images from 11 clinical institutions across 4 imaging modalities. We evaluated PanDerm on 28 diverse benchmarks, including skin cancer screening, risk stratification, differential diagnosis of common and rare skin conditions, lesion segmentation, longitudinal monitoring, and metastasis prediction and prognosis. PanDerm achieved state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated tasks, often outperforming existing models when using only 10% of labeled data. We conducted three reader studies to assess PanDerm's potential clinical utility. PanDerm outperformed clinicians by 10.2% in early-stage melanoma detection through longitudinal analysis, improved clinicians' skin cancer diagnostic accuracy by 11% on dermoscopy images, and enhanced non-dermatologist healthcare providers' differential diagnosis by 16.5% across 128 skin conditions on clinical photographs. These results demonstrate PanDerm's potential to improve patient care across diverse clinical scenarios and serve as a model for developing multimodal foundation models in other medical specialties, potentially accelerating the integration of AI support in healthcare.

Existing pre-trained solutions rely on graph learning with complex functional supervision, such as truth table simulation. However, they only handle simple and-inverter graphs (AIGs), struggling to fully encode other complex gate functionalities. While large language models (LLMs) excel at functional understanding, they lack the structural awareness for flattened netlists. To advance netlist representation learning, we present NetTAG, a netlist foundation model that fuses gate semantics with graph structure, handling diverse gate types and supporting a variety of functional and physical tasks. Moving beyond existing graph-only methods, NetTAG formulates netlists as text-attributed graphs, with gates annotated by symbolic logic expressions and physical characteristics as text attributes. Its multimodal architecture combines an LLM-based text encoder for gate semantics and a graph transformer for global structure. Pre-trained with gate and graph self-supervised objectives and aligned with RTL and layout stages, NetTAG captures comprehensive circuit intrinsics. Experimental results show that NetTAG consistently outperforms each task-specific method on four largely different functional and physical tasks and surpasses state-of-the-art AIG encoders, demonstrating its versatility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2025</p></details> |

This raises an important question: How can we train a graph foundational model on multiple source domains and adapt to an unseen target domain? A major obstacle is that graphs from different domains often exhibit divergent characteristics. Some studies leverage large language models to align multiple domains based on textual descriptions associated with the graphs, limiting their applicability to text-attributed graphs. For text-free graphs, a few recent works attempt to align different feature distributions across domains, while generally neglecting structural differences. In this work, we propose a novel Structure Alignment framework for text-free Multi-domain Graph Pre-Training and cross-domain adaptation (SAMGPT). It is designed to learn multi-domain knowledge from graphs originating in multiple source domains, which can then be adapted to address applications in an unseen target domain. Specifically, we introduce a set of structure tokens to harmonize structure-based aggregation across source domains during the pre-training phase. Next, for cross-domain adaptation, we design dual prompts, namely, holistic prompts and specific prompts, which adapt unified multi-domain structural knowledge and fine-grained, domain-specific information, respectively, to a target domain. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on seven public datasets to evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of SAMGPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW2025 Main Track</p></details> |

Fine-tuning VFMs can further unlock their potential for downstream tasks or scenarios. However, VFMs often contain significant feature redundancy, which may limit their adaptability to new tasks. In this paper, we investigate the redundancies in the segment anything model (SAM) and then propose a parameter-free fine-tuning method to address this issue. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods that adjust parameters, our method emphasizes selecting, reusing, and enhancing pre-trained features, offering a new perspective on model fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce a channel selection algorithm based on the model's output difference to identify redundant and effective channels. By selectively replacing the redundant channels with more effective ones, we filter out less useful features and reuse the more relevant features to downstream tasks, thereby enhancing the task-specific feature representation. Experiments on both out-of-domain and in-domain datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method. Notably, our approach can seamlessly integrate with existing fine-tuning strategies (e.g., LoRA, Adapter), further boosting the performance of already fine-tuned models. Moreover, since our channel selection involves only model inference, our method significantly reduces computational and GPU memory overhead.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies show that token distributions in foundation models exhibit scale-free properties, suggesting that hyperbolic space is a more suitable ambient space than Euclidean space for many pre-training and downstream tasks. However, existing tools lack essential components for building hyperbolic foundation models, making it difficult to leverage recent advancements. We introduce HyperCore, a comprehensive open-source framework that provides core modules for constructing hyperbolic foundation models across multiple modalities. HyperCore's modules can be effortlessly combined to develop novel hyperbolic foundation models, eliminating the need to extensively modify Euclidean modules from scratch and possible redundant research efforts. To demonstrate its versatility, we build and test the first fully hyperbolic vision transformers (LViT) with a fine-tuning pipeline, the first fully hyperbolic multimodal CLIP model (L-CLIP), and a hybrid Graph RAG with a hyperbolic graph encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that LViT outperforms its Euclidean counterpart. Additionally, we benchmark and reproduce experiments across hyperbolic GNNs, CNNs, Transformers, and vision Transformers to highlight HyperCore's advantages.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Given SAM's wide applications, understanding its robustness against adversarial attacks is crucial for real-world deployment. However, research on SAM's robustness is still in its early stages. Existing attacks often overlook the role of prompts in evaluating SAM's robustness, and there has been insufficient exploration of defense methods to balance the robustness and accuracy. To address these gaps, this paper proposes an adversarial robustness framework designed to evaluate and enhance the robustness of SAM. Specifically, we introduce a cross-prompt attack method to enhance the attack transferability across different prompt types. Besides attacking, we propose a few-parameter adaptation strategy to defend SAM against various adversarial attacks. To balance robustness and accuracy, we use the singular value decomposition (SVD) to constrain the space of trainable parameters, where only singular values are adaptable. Experiments demonstrate that our cross-prompt attack method outperforms previous approaches in terms of attack success rate on both SAM and SAM 2. By adapting only 512 parameters, we achieve at least a 15\% improvement in mean intersection over union (mIoU) against various adversarial attacks. Compared to previous defense methods, our approach enhances the robustness of SAM while maximally maintaining its original performance.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |
