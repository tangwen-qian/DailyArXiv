| **[Distributed Spatial-Temporal Trajectory Optimization for Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle Swarm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17541v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Swarm trajectory optimization problems are a well-recognized class of multi-agent optimal control problems with strong nonlinearity. However, the heuristic nature of needing to set the final time for agents beforehand and the time-consuming limitation of the significant number of iterations prohibit the application of existing methods to large-scale swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in practice. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal trajectory optimization framework that accomplishes multi-UAV consensus based on the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) and uses Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) for fast local planning of individual UAVs. The introduced framework is a two-level architecture that employs Parameterized DDP (PDDP) as the trajectory optimizer for each UAV, and ADMM to satisfy the local constraints and accomplish the spatial-temporal parameter consensus among all UAVs. This results in a fully distributed algorithm called Distributed Parameterized DDP (D-PDDP). In addition, an adaptive tuning criterion based on the spectral gradient method for the penalty parameter is proposed to reduce the number of algorithmic iterations. Several simulation examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Spatial Treatment Effects as Continuous Functionals: Theory and Evidence from Healthcare Access](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15324v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I develop a continuous functional framework for spatial treatment effects grounded in Navier-Stokes partial differential equations. Rather than discrete treatment parameters, the framework characterizes treatment intensity as continuous functions $\tau(\mathbf{x}, t)$ over space-time, enabling rigorous analysis of boundary evolution, spatial gradients, and cumulative exposure. Empirical validation using 32,520 U.S. ZIP codes demonstrates exponential spatial decay for healthcare access ($\kappa = 0.002837$ per km, $R^2 = 0.0129$) with detectable boundaries at 37.1 km. The framework successfully diagnoses when scope conditions hold: positive decay parameters validate diffusion assumptions near hospitals, while negative parameters correctly signal urban confounding effects. Heterogeneity analysis reveals 2-13 $\times$ stronger distance effects for elderly populations and substantial education gradients. Model selection strongly favors logarithmic decay over exponential ($\Delta \text{AIC} > 10,000$), representing a middle ground between exponential and power-law decay. Applications span environmental economics, banking, and healthcare policy. The continuous functional framework provides predictive capability ($d^*(t) = \xi^* \sqrt{t}$), parameter sensitivity ($\partial d^*/\partial \nu$), and diagnostic tests unavailable in traditional difference-in-differences approaches.</p></details> | 68 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Dynamic Spatial Treatment Effect Boundaries: A Continuous Functional Framework from Navier-Stokes Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14409v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for dynamic spatial treatment effect boundaries using continuous functional definitions grounded in Navier-Stokes partial differential equations. Rather than discrete treatment effect estimators, the framework characterizes treatment intensity as a continuous function $\tau(\mathbf{x}, t)$ over space-time, enabling rigorous analysis of propagation dynamics, boundary evolution, and cumulative exposure patterns. Building on exact self-similar solutions expressible through Kummer confluent hypergeometric and modified Bessel functions, I establish that treatment effects follow scaling laws $\tau(d, t) = t^{-\alpha} f(d/t^\beta)$ where exponents characterize diffusion mechanisms. Empirical validation using 42 million TROPOMI satellite observations of NO$_2$ pollution from U.S. coal-fired power plants demonstrates strong exponential spatial decay ($\kappa_s = 0.004$ per km, $R^2 = 0.35$) with detectable boundaries at 572 km. Monte Carlo simulations confirm superior performance over discrete parametric methods in boundary detection and false positive avoidance (94\% vs 27\% correct rejection). Regional heterogeneity analysis validates diagnostic capability: positive decay parameters within 100 km confirm coal plant dominance; negative parameters beyond 100 km correctly signal when urban sources dominate. The continuous functional perspective unifies spatial econometrics with mathematical physics, providing theoretically grounded methods for boundary detection, exposure quantification, and policy evaluation across environmental economics, banking, and healthcare applications.</p></details> | 79 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Nonparametric Identification of Spatial Treatment Effect Boundaries: Evidence from Bank Branch Consolidation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13148v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I develop a nonparametric framework for identifying spatial boundaries of treatment effects without imposing parametric functional form restrictions. The method employs local linear regression with data-driven bandwidth selection to flexibly estimate spatial decay patterns and detect treatment effect boundaries. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the nonparametric approach exhibits lower bias and correctly identifies the absence of boundaries when none exist, unlike parametric methods that may impose spurious spatial patterns. I apply this framework to bank branch openings during 2015--2020, matching 5,743 new branches to 5.9 million mortgage applications across 14,209 census tracts. The analysis reveals that branch proximity significantly affects loan application volume (8.5\% decline per 10 miles) but not approval rates, consistent with branches stimulating demand through local presence while credit decisions remain centralized. Examining branch survival during the digital transformation era (2010--2023), I find a non-monotonic relationship with area income: high-income areas experience more closures despite conventional wisdom. This counterintuitive pattern reflects strategic consolidation of redundant branches in over-banked wealthy urban areas rather than discrimination against poor neighborhoods. Controlling for branch density, urbanization, and competition, the direct income effect diminishes substantially, with branch density emerging as the primary determinant of survival. These findings demonstrate the necessity of flexible nonparametric methods for detecting complex spatial patterns that parametric models would miss, and challenge simplistic narratives about banking deserts by revealing the organizational complexity underlying spatial consolidation decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>61 pa...</summary><p>61 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Spatial and Temporal Boundaries in Difference-in-Differences: A Framework from Navier-Stokes Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11013v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a unified framework for identifying spatial and temporal boundaries of treatment effects in difference-in-differences designs. Starting from fundamental fluid dynamics equations (Navier-Stokes), we derive conditions under which treatment effects decay exponentially in space and time, enabling researchers to calculate explicit boundaries beyond which effects become undetectable. The framework encompasses both linear (pure diffusion) and nonlinear (advection-diffusion with chemical reactions) regimes, with testable scope conditions based on dimensionless numbers from physics (P\'eclet and Reynolds numbers). We demonstrate the framework's diagnostic capability using air pollution from coal-fired power plants. Analyzing 791 ground-based PM$_{2.5}$ monitors and 189,564 satellite-based NO$_2$ grid cells in the Western United States over 2019-2021, we find striking regional heterogeneity: within 100 km of coal plants, both pollutants show positive spatial decay (PM$_{2.5}$: $\kappa_s = 0.00200$, $d^* = 1,153$ km; NO$_2$: $\kappa_s = 0.00112$, $d^* = 2,062$ km), validating the framework. Beyond 100 km, negative decay parameters correctly signal that urban sources dominate and diffusion assumptions fail. Ground-level PM$_{2.5}$ decays approximately twice as fast as satellite column NO$_2$, consistent with atmospheric transport physics. The framework successfully diagnoses its own validity in four of eight analyzed regions, providing researchers with physics-based tools to assess whether their spatial difference-in-differences setting satisfies diffusion assumptions before applying the estimator. Our results demonstrate that rigorous boundary detection requires both theoretical derivation from first principles and empirical validation of underlying physical assumptions.</p></details> | 56 pages, 4 figures |
| **[From Spatial to Actions: Grounding Vision-Language-Action Model in Spatial Foundation Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17439v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models act in 3D real-world but are typically built on 2D encoders, leaving a spatial reasoning gap that limits generalization and adaptability. Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone. These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation, modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive baselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and variations in object scale and height.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://falcon-vla.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[M2H: Multi-Task Learning with Efficient Window-Based Cross-Task Attention for Monocular Spatial Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17363v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying real-time spatial perception on edge devices requires efficient multi-task models that leverage complementary task information while minimizing computational overhead. This paper introduces Multi-Mono-Hydra (M2H), a novel multi-task learning framework designed for semantic segmentation and depth, edge, and surface normal estimation from a single monocular image. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on independent single-task models or shared encoder-decoder architectures, M2H introduces a Window-Based Cross-Task Attention Module that enables structured feature exchange while preserving task-specific details, improving prediction consistency across tasks. Built on a lightweight ViT-based DINOv2 backbone, M2H is optimized for real-time deployment and serves as the foundation for monocular spatial perception systems supporting 3D scene graph construction in dynamic environments. Comprehensive evaluations show that M2H outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task models on NYUDv2, surpasses single-task depth and semantic baselines on Hypersim, and achieves superior performance on the Cityscapes dataset, all while maintaining computational efficiency on laptop hardware. Beyond benchmarks, M2H is validated on real-world data, demonstrating its practicality in spatial perception tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025). 8 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Planar or Spatial: Exploring Design Aspects and Challenges for Presentations in Virtual Reality with No-coding Interface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17073v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of virtual reality (VR) has led to its increasing adoption as an immersive medium for delivering presentations, distinct from other VR experiences like games and 360-degree videos by sharing information in richly interactive environments. However, creating engaging VR presentations remains a challenging and time-consuming task for users, hindering the full realization of VR presentation's capabilities. This research aims to explore the potential of VR presentation, analyze users' opinions, and investigate these via providing a user-friendly no-coding authoring tool. Through an examination of popular presentation software and interviews with seven professionals, we identified five design aspects and four design challenges for VR presentations. Based on the findings, we developed VRStory, a prototype for presentation authoring without coding to explore the design aspects and strategies for addressing the challenges. VRStory offers a variety of predefined and customizable VR elements, as well as modules for layout design, navigation control, and asset generation. A user study was then conducted with 12 participants to investigate their opinions and authoring experience with VRStory. Our results demonstrated that, while acknowledging the advantages of immersive and spatial features in VR, users often have a consistent mental model for traditional 2D presentations and may still prefer planar and static formats in VR for better accessibility and efficient communication. We finally shared our learned design considerations for future development of VR presentation tools, emphasizing the importance of balancing of promoting immersive features and ensuring accessibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantile Regression, Variational Autoencoders, and Diffusion Models for Uncertainty Quantification: A Spatial Analysis of Sub-seasonal Wind Speed Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16958v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study aims to improve the spatial representation of uncertainties when regressing surface wind speeds from large-scale atmospheric predictors for sub-seasonal forecasting. Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale atmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which exhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to obtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024) demonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve ensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but this method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency adequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex relationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while maintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer promising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study evaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification mechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models distribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space sampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts to regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that probabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty representations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic model offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion, deterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish probabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational sub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This Work has been submitted to Monthly Weather Review.

| **[Pursuing Minimal Sufficiency in Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16688v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning, the ability to ground language in 3D understanding, remains a persistent challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We identify two fundamental bottlenecks: inadequate 3D understanding capabilities stemming from 2D-centric pre-training, and reasoning failures induced by redundant 3D information. To address these, we first construct a Minimal Sufficient Set (MSS) of information before answering a given question: a compact selection of 3D perception results from \textit{expert models}. We introduce MSSR (Minimal Sufficient Spatial Reasoner), a dual-agent framework that implements this principle. A Perception Agent programmatically queries 3D scenes using a versatile perception toolbox to extract sufficient information, including a novel SOG (Situated Orientation Grounding) module that robustly extracts language-grounded directions. A Reasoning Agent then iteratively refines this information to pursue minimality, pruning redundant details and requesting missing ones in a closed loop until the MSS is curated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, by explicitly pursuing both sufficiency and minimality, significantly improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance across two challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework produces interpretable reasoning paths, offering a promising source of high-quality training data for future models.

| **[Large-scale spatial variable gene atlas for spatial transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07653v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial variable genes (SVGs) reveal critical information about tissue architecture, cellular interactions, and disease microenvironments. As spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies proliferate, accurately identifying SVGs across diverse platforms, tissue types, and disease contexts has become both a major opportunity and a significant computational challenge. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of 20 state-of-the-art SVG detection methods using human slides from STimage-1K4M, a large-scale resource of ST data comprising 662 slides from more than 18 tissue types. We evaluate each method across a range of biologically and technically meaningful criteria, including recovery of pathologist-annotated domain-specific markers, cross-slide reproducibility, scalability to high-resolution data, and robustness to technical variation. Our results reveal marked differences in performance depending on tissue type, spatial resolution, and study design. Beyond benchmarking, we construct the first cross-tissue atlas of SVGs, enabling comparative analysis of spatial gene programs across cancer and normal tissues. We observe similarities between pairs of tissues that reflect developmental and functional relationships, such as high overlap between thymus and lymph node, and uncover spatial gene programs associated with metastasis, immune infiltration, and tissue-of-origin identity in cancer. Together, our work defines a framework for evaluating and interpreting spatial gene expression and establishes a reference resource for the ST community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time Spatial-temporal Traversability Assessment via Feature-based Sparse Gaussian Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04134v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Terrain analysis is critical for the practical ap- plication of ground mobile robots in real-world tasks, espe- cially in outdoor unstructured environments. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal traversability assessment method, which aims to enable autonomous robots to effectively navigate through complex terrains. Our approach utilizes sparse Gaussian processes (SGP) to extract geometric features (curvature, gradient, elevation, etc.) directly from point cloud scans. These features are then used to construct a high- resolution local traversability map. Then, we design a spatial- temporal Bayesian Gaussian kernel (BGK) inference method to dynamically evaluate traversability scores, integrating historical and real-time data while considering factors such as slope, flatness, gradient, and uncertainty metrics. GPU acceleration is applied in the feature extraction step, and the system achieves real-time performance. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse terrain scenarios demonstrate that our method outper- forms SOTA approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, we develop an autonomous navigation framework integrated with the traversability map and validate it with a differential driven vehicle in complex outdoor envi- ronments. Our code will be open-source for further research and development by the community, https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/FSGP_BGK.</p></details> | accepted by IROS2025 |
| **[DIV-Nav: Open-Vocabulary Spatial Relationships for Multi-Object Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16518v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in open-vocabulary semantic mapping and object navigation have enabled robots to perform an informed search of their environment for an arbitrary object. However, such zero-shot object navigation is typically designed for simple queries with an object name like "television" or "blue rug". Here, we consider more complex free-text queries with spatial relationships, such as "find the remote on the table" while still leveraging robustness of a semantic map. We present DIV-Nav, a real-time navigation system that efficiently addresses this problem through a series of relaxations: i) Decomposing natural language instructions with complex spatial constraints into simpler object-level queries on a semantic map, ii) computing the Intersection of individual semantic belief maps to identify regions where all objects co-exist, and iii) Validating the discovered objects against the original, complex spatial constrains via a LVLM. We further investigate how to adapt the frontier exploration objectives of online semantic mapping to such spatial search queries to more effectively guide the search process. We validate our system through extensive experiments on the MultiON benchmark and real-world deployment on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot using a Jetson Orin AGX.

| **[RoboRefer: Towards Spatial Referring with Reasoning in Vision-Language Models for Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04308v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

| **[Spatial Scalar-on-Function Quantile Regression Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16429v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel spatial scalar-on-function quantile regression model that extends classical scalar-on-function models to account for spatial dependence and heterogeneous conditional distributions. The proposed model incorporates spatial autocorrelation through a spatially lagged response and characterizes the entire conditional distribution of a scalar outcome given a functional predictor. To address the endogeneity induced by the spatial lag term, we develop two robust estimation procedures based on instrumental variable strategies. $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators are established under mild regularity conditions. We demonstrate through extensive Monte Carlo simulations that the proposed estimators outperform existing mean-based and robust alternatives, particularly in settings with strong spatial dependence and outlier contamination. We apply our method to high-resolution environmental data from the Lombardy region in Italy, using daily ozone trajectories to predict daily mean particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers concentrations. The empirical results confirm the superiority of our approach in predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability across various quantile levels. Our method has been implemented in the \texttt{ssofqrm} R package.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Semiparametric Gaussian Mixture Model with Spatial Dependence and Its Application to Whole-Slide Image Clustering Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16421v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop here a semiparametric Gaussian mixture model (SGMM) for unsupervised learning with valuable spatial information taken into consideration. Specifically, we assume for each instance a random location. Then, conditional on this random location, we assume for the feature vector a standard Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The proposed SGMM allows the mixing probability to be nonparametrically related to the spatial location. Compared with a classical GMM, SGMM is considerably more flexible and allows the instances from the same class to be spatially clustered. To estimate the SGMM, novel EM algorithms are developed and rigorous asymptotic theories are established. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate our finite sample performance. For a real application, we apply our SGMM method to the CAMELYON16 dataset of whole-slide images (WSIs) for breast cancer detection. The SGMM method demonstrates outstanding clustering performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward General Digraph Contrastive Learning: A Dual Spatial Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16311v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting consistent representations from graphs, independent of labeled information. However, existing methods predominantly focus on undirected graphs, disregarding the pivotal directional information that is fundamental and indispensable in real-world networks (e.g., social networks and recommendations).In this paper, we introduce S2-DiGCL, a novel framework that emphasizes spatial insights from complex and real domain perspectives for directed graph (digraph) contrastive learning. From the complex-domain perspective, S2-DiGCL introduces personalized perturbations into the magnetic Laplacian to adaptively modulate edge phases and directional semantics. From the real-domain perspective, it employs a path-based subgraph augmentation strategy to capture fine-grained local asymmetries and topological dependencies. By jointly leveraging these two complementary spatial views, S2-DiGCL constructs high-quality positive and negative samples, leading to more general and robust digraph contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on 7 real-world digraph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving SOTA performance with 4.41% improvement in node classification and 4.34% in link prediction under both supervised and unsupervised settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-to-Spectral Harmonic-Modulated Arrays for 6G Multi-Beam MIMO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16262v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article presents an overview and analysis of spatial-to-spectral harmonic-modulated arrays (SHAs). Compared to traditional analog or digital beamforming arrays, SHAs enable concurrent multi-beamforming without requiring substantial hardware replication. SHAs replace the need for hardware replication with frequency-domain multiplexing. Furthermore, SHAs have the potential to become key contributors to future 6G networks by enabling scalable multi-user communications, joint communication and sensing, and spatial interference mitigation. In addition, an analysis of the SHA's harmonic-modulation waveform and its effects on gain, noise and bandwidth is presented. A comb-like modulation waveform for SHAs that minimizes spectral inefficiency is proposed. Further, an analysis of the SHA's capability to independently steer multiple beams is presented. This capability is quantified in terms of the SHA's spatial-to-spectral degrees of freedom. Lastly, this work introduces a novel SHA architecture that provides three spatial-to-spectral degrees of freedom with minimal hardware replication.</p></details> |  |
| **[GaSLight: Gaussian Splats for Spatially-Varying Lighting in HDR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10809v4)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GaSLight, a method that generates spatially-varying lighting from regular images. Our method proposes using HDR Gaussian Splats as light source representation, marking the first time regular images can serve as light sources in a 3D renderer. Our two-stage process first enhances the dynamic range of images plausibly and accurately by leveraging the priors embedded in diffusion models. Next, we employ Gaussian Splats to model 3D lighting, achieving spatially variant lighting. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results on HDR estimations and their applications in illuminating virtual objects and scenes. To facilitate the benchmarking of images as light sources, we introduce a novel dataset of calibrated and unsaturated HDR to evaluate images as light sources. We assess our method using a combination of this novel dataset and an existing dataset from the literature. Project page: https://lvsn.github.io/gaslight/</p></details> |  |
| **[BASIN: Bayesian mAtrix variate normal model with Spatial and sparsIty priors in Non-negative deconvolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16130v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics allows researchers to visualize and analyze gene expression within the precise location of tissues or cells. It provides spatially resolved gene expression data but often lacks cellular resolution, necessitating cell type deconvolution to infer cellular composition at each spatial location. In this paper we propose BASIN for cell type deconvolution, which models deconvolution as a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) problem incorporating graph Laplacian prior. Rather than find a deterministic optima like other recent methods, we propose a matrix variate Bayesian NMF method with nonnegativity and sparsity priors, in which the variables are maintained in their matrix form to derive a more efficient matrix normal posterior. BASIN employs a Gibbs sampler to approximate the posterior distribution of cell type proportions and other parameters, offering a distribution of possible solutions, enhancing robustness and providing inherent uncertainty quantification. The performance of BASIN is evaluated on different spatial transcriptomics datasets and outperforms other deconvolution methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The results also show the effect of the incorporated priors and reflect a truncated matrix normal distribution as we expect.</p></details> | 26 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Spatial Reasoning in Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15841v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg) to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL) formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally, these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters, validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniMamba: Unified Spatial-Channel Representation Learning with Group-Efficient Mamba for LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12009v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in LiDAR 3D detection have demonstrated the effectiveness of Transformer-based frameworks in capturing the global dependencies from point cloud spaces, which serialize the 3D voxels into the flattened 1D sequence for iterative self-attention. However, the spatial structure of 3D voxels will be inevitably destroyed during the serialization process. Besides, due to the considerable number of 3D voxels and quadratic complexity of Transformers, multiple sequences are grouped before feeding to Transformers, leading to a limited receptive field. Inspired by the impressive performance of State Space Models (SSM) achieved in the field of 2D vision tasks, in this paper, we propose a novel Unified Mamba (UniMamba), which seamlessly integrates the merits of 3D convolution and SSM in a concise multi-head manner, aiming to perform "local and global" spatial context aggregation efficiently and simultaneously. Specifically, a UniMamba block is designed which mainly consists of spatial locality modeling, complementary Z-order serialization and local-global sequential aggregator. The spatial locality modeling module integrates 3D submanifold convolution to capture the dynamic spatial position embedding before serialization. Then the efficient Z-order curve is adopted for serialization both horizontally and vertically. Furthermore, the local-global sequential aggregator adopts the channel grouping strategy to efficiently encode both "local and global" spatial inter-dependencies using multi-head SSM. Additionally, an encoder-decoder architecture with stacked UniMamba blocks is formed to facilitate multi-scale spatial learning hierarchically. Extensive experiments are conducted on three popular datasets: nuScenes, Waymo and Argoverse 2. Particularly, our UniMamba achieves 70.2 mAP on the nuScenes dataset.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |
| **[Nonparametric Testing of Spatial Dependence in 2D and 3D Random Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15381v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a flexible and robust nonparametric framework for testing spatial dependence in two- and three-dimensional random fields. Our approach involves converting spatial data into one-dimensional time series using space-filling Hilbert curves. We then apply ordinal pattern-based tests for serial dependence to this series. Because Hilbert curves preserve spatial locality, spatial dependence in the original field manifests as serial dependence in the transformed sequence. The approach is easy to implement, accommodates arbitrary grid sizes through generalized Hilbert (``gilbert'') curves, and naturally extends beyond three dimensions. This provides a practical and general alternative to existing methods based on spatial ordinal patterns, which are typically limited to two-dimensional settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[MRSAudio: A Large-Scale Multimodal Recorded Spatial Audio Dataset with Refined Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10396v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans rely on multisensory integration to perceive spatial environments, where auditory cues enable sound source localization in three-dimensional space. Despite the critical role of spatial audio in immersive technologies such as VR/AR, most existing multimodal datasets provide only monaural audio, which limits the development of spatial audio generation and understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce MRSAudio, a large-scale multimodal spatial audio dataset designed to advance research in spatial audio understanding and generation. MRSAudio spans four distinct components: MRSLife, MRSSpeech, MRSMusic, and MRSSing, covering diverse real-world scenarios. The dataset includes synchronized binaural and ambisonic audio, exocentric and egocentric video, motion trajectories, and fine-grained annotations such as transcripts, phoneme boundaries, lyrics, scores, and prompts. To demonstrate the utility and versatility of MRSAudio, we establish five foundational tasks: audio spatialization, and spatial text to speech, spatial singing voice synthesis, spatial music generation and sound event localization and detection. Results show that MRSAudio enables high-quality spatial modeling and supports a broad range of spatial audio research.

| **[Spatial Supply Repositioning with Censored Demand Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19208v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a network inventory system motivated by one-way, on-demand vehicle sharing services. Under uncertain and correlated network demand, the service operator periodically repositions vehicles to match a fixed supply with spatial customer demand while minimizing costs. Finding an optimal repositioning policy in such a general inventory network is analytically and computationally challenging. We introduce a base-stock repositioning policy as a multidimensional generalization of the classical inventory rule to $n$ locations, and we establish its asymptotic optimality under two practically relevant regimes. We present exact reformulations that enable efficient computation of the best base-stock policy in an offline setting with historical data. In the online setting, we illustrate the challenges of learning with censored data in networked systems through a regret lower bound analysis and by demonstrating the suboptimality of alternative algorithmic approaches. We propose a Surrogate Optimization and Adaptive Repositioning algorithm and prove that it attains an optimal regret of $O(n^{2.5} \sqrt{T})$, which matches the regret lower bound in $T$ with polynomial dependence on $n$. Our work highlights the critical role of inventory repositioning in the viability of shared mobility businesses and illuminates the inherent challenges posed by data and network complexity. Our results demonstrate that simple, interpretable policies, such as the state-independent base-stock policies we analyze, can provide significant practical value and achieve near-optimal performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper split: part of v1 (mainly Appendix F) is now superseded by another standalone paper</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Forcing: Implicit Spatial Representation Alignment for Vision-language-action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12276v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently shown strong potential in enabling robots to follow language instructions and execute precise actions. However, most VLAs are built upon vision-language models pretrained solely on 2D data, which lack accurate spatial awareness and hinder their ability to operate in the 3D physical world. Existing solutions attempt to incorporate explicit 3D sensor inputs such as depth maps or point clouds, but these approaches face challenges due to sensor noise, hardware heterogeneity, and incomplete depth coverage in existing datasets. Alternative methods that estimate 3D cues from 2D images also suffer from the limited performance of depth estimators. We propose Spatial Forcing (SF), a simple yet effective alignment strategy that implicitly forces VLA models to develop spatial comprehension capabilities without relying on explicit 3D inputs or depth estimators. SF aligns intermediate visual embeddings of VLAs with geometric representations produced by pretrained 3D foundation models. By enforcing alignment at intermediate layers, SF guides VLAs to encode richer spatial representations that enhance action precision. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that SF achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both 2D- and 3D-based VLAs. SF further accelerates training by up to 3.8x and improves data efficiency across diverse robotic tasks. Project page is at https://spatial-forcing.github.io/</p></details> |  |

In contrast, while spatial intelligence is fundamental for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world interaction, the systematic study of their complex spatial reasoning remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SIRI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' structural spatial intelligence through spatial-grounded reasoning tasks. SIRI-Bench comprises 9,000 video-question-answer triplets, where each problem is embedded in a realistic 3D scene. The benchmark is carefully designed so that solving each problem requires both spatial comprehension and structural reasoning. To facilitate large-scale data synthesis, we develop an Automatic Scene Creation Engine that employs collaborative LLM agents to translate abstract mathematical problems into faithful 3D scenes. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle significantly on SIRI-Bench, underscoring the challenge of structural spatial reasoning. We hope that our study will bring researchers' attention to spatially grounded reasoning and advance VLMs in visual problem-solving.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |

We identify a key limitation: while tactile sensors provide rich contact information, current learning frameworks fail to effectively leverage both the perceptual richness of tactile signals and their spatial relationship with hand kinematics. We believe an ideal tactile representation should explicitly ground contact measurements in a stable reference frame while preserving detailed sensory information, enabling policies to not only detect contact occurrence but also precisely infer object geometry in the hand's coordinate system. We introduce SaTA (Spatially-anchored Tactile Awareness for dexterous manipulation), an end-to-end policy framework that explicitly anchors tactile features to the hand's kinematic frame through forward kinematics, enabling accurate geometric reasoning without requiring object models or explicit pose estimation. Our key insight is that spatially grounded tactile representations allow policies to not only detect contact occurrence but also precisely infer object geometry in the hand's coordinate system. We validate SaTA on challenging dexterous manipulation tasks, including bimanual USB-C mating in free space, a task demanding sub-millimeter alignment precision, as well as light bulb installation requiring precise thread engagement and rotational control, and card sliding that demands delicate force modulation and angular precision. These tasks represent significant challenges for learning-based methods due to their stringent precision requirements. Across multiple benchmarks, SaTA significantly outperforms strong visuo-tactile baselines, improving success rates by up to 30 percentage while reducing task completion times by 27 percentage.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Spatial Preference Rewarding for MLLMs Spatial Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14374v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with minimal overhead in training.

The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling robots to navigate to the target positions following the natural language instructions. In practical agricultural scenarios, navigation instructions often repeatedly occur, yet AgriVLN treat each instruction as an independent episode, overlooking the potential of past experiences to provide spatial context for subsequent ones. To bridge this gap, we propose the method of Spatial Understanding Memory for Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation (SUM-AgriVLN), in which the SUM module employs spatial understanding and save spatial memory through 3D reconstruction and representation. When evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our SUM-AgriVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47 to 0.54 with slight sacrifice on Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.93m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

| **[SIG-Chat: Spatial Intent-Guided Conversational Gesture Generation Involving How, When and Where](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23852v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accompanying actions and gestures in dialogue are often closely linked to interactions with the environment, such as looking toward the interlocutor or using gestures to point to the described target at appropriate moments. Speech and semantics guide the production of gestures by determining their timing (WHEN) and style (HOW), while the spatial locations of interactive objects dictate their directional execution (WHERE). Existing approaches either rely solely on descriptive language to generate motions or utilize audio to produce non-interactive gestures, thereby lacking the characterization of interactive timing and spatial intent. This significantly limits the applicability of conversational gesture generation, whether in robotics or in the fields of game and animation production. To address this gap, we present a full-stack solution. We first established a unique data collection method to simultaneously capture high-precision human motion and spatial intent. We then developed a generation model driven by audio, language, and spatial data, alongside dedicated metrics for evaluating interaction timing and spatial accuracy. Finally, we deployed the solution on a humanoid robot, enabling rich, context-aware physical interactions.</p></details> |  |

However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images. SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation. CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization.

With advancements in autonomous driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with 4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene understanding.

To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of spatial computing communications (SCC), a framework designed to meet the latency and energy demands of multi-user VR over distributed mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. SCC jointly represents the physical space, defined by users and base stations, and the virtual space, representing shared immersive environments, using a probabilistic model of user dynamics and resource requirements. The resource deployment task is then formulated as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problem that simultaneously minimizes system latency and energy consumption across distributed MEC resources. To solve this problem, we propose MO-CMPO, a multi-objective consistency model with policy optimization that integrates supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning guided by preference weights. Leveraging a sparse graph neural network (GNN), MO-CMPO efficiently generates Pareto-optimal solutions. Simulations with real-world New Radio base station datasets demonstrate that MO-CMPO achieves superior hypervolume performance and significantly lower inference latency than baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis reveals practical deployment patterns: latency-oriented solutions favor local MEC execution to reduce transmission delay, while energy-oriented solutions minimize redundant placements to save energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submited to IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[Prescribed Performance Control of Deformable Object Manipulation in Spatial Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14234v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manipulating three-dimensional (3D) deformable objects presents significant challenges for robotic systems due to their infinite-dimensional state space and complex deformable dynamics. This paper proposes a novel model-free approach for shape control with constraints imposed on key points. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature dimensionality reduction, the proposed controller leverages the coordinates of key points as the feature vector, which are extracted from the deformable object's point cloud using deep learning methods. This approach not only reduces the dimensionality of the feature space but also retains the spatial information of the object. By extracting key points, the manipulation of deformable objects is simplified into a visual servoing problem, where the shape dynamics are described using a deformation Jacobian matrix. To enhance control accuracy, a prescribed performance control method is developed by integrating barrier Lyapunov functions (BLF) to enforce constraints on the key points. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously analyzed and verified using the Lyapunov method. Experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[STEMS: Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe Multi-Agent Coordination for Building Energy Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14112v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals, improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems. Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees, and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management. STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and maintains effectiveness across different building types.</p></details> |  |

The primary goal is to reconstruct the spatial component of the source term from partial observations of the system's state and its time derivative over a subset of the domain. A reconstruction formula for the Fourier coefficients of the unknown source is derived, leveraging the null controllability property of the fractional heat equation when the fractional order lies in the interval $s\in(1/2,1)$. The methodology builds on spectral analysis and Volterra integral equations, providing a robust framework for recovering spatial sources under limited measurement data. Numerical experiments confirm the accuracy and stability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially Intelligent Patrol Routes for Concealed Emitter Localization by Robot Swarms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14018v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a method for designing spatially intelligent robot swarm behaviors to localize concealed radio emitters. We use differential evolution to generate geometric patrol routes that localize unknown signals independently of emitter parameters, a key challenge in electromagnetic surveillance. Patrol shape and antenna type are shown to influence information gain, which in turn determines the effective triangulation coverage. We simulate a four-robot swarm across eight configurations, assigning pre-generated patrol routes based on a specified patrol shape and sensing capability (antenna type: omnidirectional or directional). An emitter is placed within the map for each trial, with randomized position, transmission power and frequency. Results show that omnidirectional localization success rates are driven primarily by source location rather than signal properties, with failures occurring most often when sources are placed in peripheral areas of the map. Directional antennas are able to overcome this limitation due to their higher gain and directivity, with an average detection success rate of 98.75% compared to 80.25% for omnidirectional. Average localization errors range from 1.01-1.30 m for directional sensing and 1.67-1.90 m for omnidirectional sensing; while directional sensing also benefits from shorter patrol edges. These results demonstrate that a swarm's ability to predict electromagnetic phenomena is directly dependent on its physical interaction with the environment. Consequently, spatial intelligence, realized here through optimized patrol routes and antenna selection, is a critical design consideration for effective robotic surveillance.</p></details> |  |
| **[InternVLA-M1: A Spatially Guided Vision-Language-Action Framework for Generalist Robot Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13778v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce InternVLA-M1, a unified framework for spatial grounding and robot control that advances instruction-following robots toward scalable, general-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guided vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual, embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box, point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes, enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.

Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data, cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training. UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability across diverse data availability scenarios.

This study analyzed confirmed dengue cases in Recife from 2015 to 2024 using a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model implemented in R-INLA, combining a BYM2 spatial structure with an RW1 temporal component. Covariates included population density, household size, income, drainage channels, lagged precipitation, and mean temperature. Population density and household size had positive effects on dengue risk, while income and channel presence were protective. Lagged precipitation increased risk, and higher temperatures showed an inverse association, suggesting thermal thresholds for vector activity. The model achieved good fit (DIC=65817; WAIC=64506) and stable convergence, with moderate residual spatial autocorrelation (phi=0.06) and a smooth temporal trend between 2016 and 2019. Spatio-temporal estimates revealed persistent high-risk clusters in northern and western Recife, overlapping with areas of higher density and social vulnerability. Beyond reproducing historical patterns, the Bayesian model supports probabilistic forecasting and early warning systems. Compared with classical models (GLM, SAR, GWR, GTWR), INLA explicitly integrates uncertainty and spatial-temporal dependence, offering credible interval inference for decision-making in urban health management.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Unfortunately, existing benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark, \textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants: \textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic, \textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover, to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions, resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence, especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research toward human-like spatial intelligence.

However, their performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs. 93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

However, with modern technology, it is common to observe vector-valued mixed-type responses, e.g., a combination of binary, count, or continuous types, at each location. Methods that allow joint modeling of such mixed-type multivariate spatial responses are rare. Using latent multivariate Gaussian processes (GPs), we present a class of Bayesian spatial methods that can be employed for any combination of exponential family responses. Since multivariate GP-based methods can suffer from computational bottlenecks when the number of spatial locations is high, we further employ a computationally efficient Vecchia approximation for fast posterior inference and prediction. Key theoretical properties of the proposed model, such as identifiability and the structure of the induced covariance, are established. Our approach employs a Markov chain Monte Carlo-based inference method that utilizes elliptical slice sampling in a blocked Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampling framework.

We introduce T(R,O) Grasp, a diffusion-based framework that efficiently generates accurate and diverse grasps across multiple robotic hands. At its core is the T(R,O) Graph, a unified representation that models spatial transformations between robotic hands and objects while encoding their geometric properties. A graph diffusion model, coupled with an efficient inverse kinematics solver, supports both unconditioned and conditioned grasp synthesis. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of dexterous hands show that T(R,O) Grasp achieves average success rate of 94.83%, inference speed of 0.21s, and throughput of 41 grasps per second on an NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU, substantially outperforming existing baselines. In addition, our approach is robust and generalizable across embodiments while significantly reducing memory consumption. More importantly, the high inference speed enables closed-loop dexterous manipulation, underscoring the potential of T(R,O) Grasp to scale into a foundation model for dexterous grasping.</p></details> | 12 pages, 14 figures |

This paper revisits the $\alpha$--regression framework, which uses a flexible power transformation parameterized by $\alpha$ to interpolate between raw data analysis and log-ratio methods, naturally handling zeros without imputation while allowing data-driven transformation selection. We formulate $\alpha$--regression as a non-linear least squares problem, provide efficient estimation via the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with explicit gradient and Hessian derivations, establish asymptotic normality of the estimators, and derive marginal effects for interpretation. The framework is extended to spatial settings through two models: the $\alpha$--spatially lagged X regression model, which incorporates spatial spillover effects via spatially lagged covariates with decomposition into direct and indirect effects, and the geographically weighted $\alpha$--regression, which allows coefficients to vary spatially for capturing local relationships. Application to Greek agricultural land-use data demonstrates that spatial extensions substantially improve predictive performance.</p></details> |  |

Its main goal is to integrate multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness. On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain. AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating superior fusion capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>For t...</summary><p>For the first time, angle-based perception was introduced into the multi-modality image fusion task</p></details> |
| **[GPA-RAM: Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba for Spatial Task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19683v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing robot manipulation methods prioritize task learning by enhancing perception through complex deep network architectures. However, they face challenges in real-time collision-free planning. Hence, Robotic Attention Mamba (RAM) is designed for refined planning. Specifically, by integrating Mamba and parallel single-view attention, RAM aligns multi-view vision and task-related language features, ensuring efficient fine-grained task planning with linear complexity and robust real-time performance. Nevertheless, it has the potential for further improvement in high-precision grasping and manipulation. Thus, Grasp-Pretraining Augmentation (GPA) is devised, with a grasp pose feature extractor pretrained utilizing object grasp poses directly inherited from whole-task demonstrations. Subsequently, the extracted grasp features are fused with the spatially aligned planning features from RAM through attention-based Pre-trained Location Fusion, preserving high-resolution grasping cues overshadowed by an overemphasis on global planning. To summarize, we propose Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba (GPA-RAM), dividing spatial task learning into RAM for planning skill learning and GPA for grasping skill learning. GPA-RAM demonstrates superior performance across three robot systems with distinct camera configurations in simulation and the real world. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, it improves the absolute success rate by 8.2% (from 79.3% to 87.5%) on the RLBench multi-task benchmark and 40% (from 16% to 56%), 12% (from 86% to 98%) on the ALOHA bimanual manipulation tasks, while delivering notably faster inference. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that both RAM and GPA enhance task learning, with GPA proving robust to different architectures of pretrained grasp pose feature extractors.

Following the idea of the convolution approach, the diffusion-wave model is first transformed into an equivalent formulation. A fully discrete scheme is then developed by applying a compact difference approximation in space and combining the averaged product integration rule with linear interpolation quadrature in time. An efficient high-order two-grid algorithm is constructed by solving a small-scale nonlinear system on the coarse grid and a large-scale linearized system on the fine grid, where the bicubic spline interpolation operator is used to project coarse-grid solutions to the fine grid. Under mild assumptions on the variable exponent $\alpha(t)$, the stability and convergence of the STG compact difference scheme are rigorously established. Numerical experiments are finally presented to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPL: Spatial-Conditioned Diffusion Prototype Enhancement for One-Shot Medical Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12159v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization. This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics, and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IVCNZ 2025.

While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts are created via two-stage imaging feature-space clustering using contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 20 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space. Code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/uclabair/SPADE.</p></details> |  |

Existing models often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of 73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted at ICCV Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Semi-Unsupervised Microscopy Segmentation with Fuzzy Logic and Spatial Statistics for Cross-Domain Analysis Using a GUI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15979v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brightfield microscopy of unstained live cells is challenging due to low contrast, dynamic morphology, uneven illumination, and lack of labels. Deep learning achieved SOTA performance on stained, high-contrast images but needs large labeled datasets, expensive hardware, and fails under uneven illumination. This study presents a low-cost, lightweight, annotation-free segmentation method by introducing one-time calibration-assisted unsupervised framework adaptable across imaging modalities and image type. The framework determines background via spatial standard deviation from the local mean. Uncertain pixels are resolved using fuzzy logic, cumulative squared shift of nodal intensity, statistical features, followed by post-segmentation denoising calibration which is saved as a profile for reuse until noise pattern or object type substantially change. The program runs as a script or graphical interface for non-programmers. The method was rigorously evaluated using \textit{IoU}, \textit{F1-score}, and other metrics, with statistical significance confirmed via Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. On unstained brightfield myoblast (C2C12) images, it outperformed \textit{Cellpose 3.0} and \textit{StarDist}, improving IoU by up to 48\% (average IoU = 0.43, F1 = 0.60). In phase-contrast microscopy, it achieved a mean IoU of 0.69 and an F1-score of 0.81 on the \textit{LIVECell} dataset ($n = 3178$), with substantial expert agreement ($\kappa > 0.75$) confirming cross-modality robustness. Successful segmentation of laser-affected polymer surfaces further confirmed cross-domain robustness. By introducing the \textit{Homogeneous Image Plane} concept, this work provides a new theoretical foundation for training-free, annotation-free segmentation. The framework operates efficiently on CPU, avoids cell staining, and is practical for live-cell imaging and biomedical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[NV3D: Leveraging Spatial Shape Through Normal Vector-based 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11632v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18% mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61% and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of voxels being filtered out.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Is Spatial Reasoning Hard for VLMs? An Attention Mechanism Perspective on Focus Areas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01773v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) have long struggled with spatial reasoning tasks. Surprisingly, even simple spatial reasoning tasks, such as recognizing "under" or "behind" relationships between only two objects, pose significant challenges for current VLMs. In this work, we study the spatial reasoning challenge from the lens of mechanistic interpretability, diving into the model's internal states to examine the interactions between image and text tokens. By tracing attention distribution over the image through out intermediate layers, we observe that successful spatial reasoning correlates strongly with the model's ability to align its attention distribution with actual object locations, particularly differing between familiar and unfamiliar spatial relationships. Motivated by these findings, we propose ADAPTVIS based on inference-time confidence scores to sharpen the attention on highly relevant regions when confident, while smoothing and broadening the attention window to consider a wider context when confidence is lower. This training-free decoding method shows significant improvement (e.g., up to a 50 absolute point improvement) on spatial reasoning benchmarks such as WhatsUp and VSR with negligible cost. We make code and data publicly available for research purposes at https://github.com/shiqichen17/AdaptVis.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, the very capability that anchors artificial general intelligence in the physical world. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models (GPT, Gemini, Grok, Seed, Qwen, and Intern) stand on the path toward spatial intelligence. We first propose a holistic taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and a standardized protocol for the fair evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models across eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding ten billion total tokens. Our empirical study then reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence (SI), yet (2) still falls short of human performance significantly across a broad spectrum of SI-tasks. Moreover, we (3) show that SI-tasks expose greater model capability deficiency than non-SI tasks, to the extent that (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult ones. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans, yet fail even the most advanced multimodal models.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, as audio foundation models are typically trained on dry, single-channel audio clips, the inherent spatial nature of real-world sound scenes is overlooked and tasks involving sound localization ruled out. To address these limitations, we propose GRAM: a General-purpose Real-world Audio Model utilizing a multi-channel masked auto-encoder approach to efficiently learn spatial audio representations from high-quality simulated real-world scenes. To evaluate the performance of GRAM and other audio foundation models in real-world sound scenes, we release Nat-HEAR: A naturalistic version of the HEAR benchmark suite comprising a simulated real-world version, as well as two new sound localization tasks. We show that the performance of GRAM surpasses all state-of-the-art self-supervised audio foundation models and speech models on both HEAR and Nat-HEAR, while using only a fraction of the training data. GRAM also showcases state-of-the-art localization performance, surpassing even supervised sound localization approaches, and can be flexibly applied either to a two-channel, binaural sound format or a four-channel, Ambisonics format. Validating GRAM's performance on real-world sound recordings demonstrates robust transfer to real-world scenes. Taken together, GRAM presents a significant advancement towards robust, spatial audio foundation models for real-world applications.</p></details> | Still under review |

Recent developments have explored the use of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals. Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and (2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2025)</p></details> |

Moreover, the Bayesian generalized fused lasso is often used as a method that efficiently provides estimation under the natural assumption that regression coefficients of adjacent regions tend to take the same value. In most Bayesian methods, the selection of prior distribution is an essential issue, and in the setting of SVC model with the Bayesian generalized fused lasso, determining the complexity of the class of prior distributions is also a challenging aspect, further amplifying the difficulty of the problem. For example, the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC), which has become standard in Bayesian model selection, does not target determining the complexity. Therefore, in this study, we adapted a criterion called the prior intensified information criterion (PIIC) to this setting. Specifically, under an asymptotic setting that retains the influence of the prior distribution, that is, under an asymptotic setting that deliberately does not provide selection consistency, we derived the asymptotic properties of our generalized fused lasso estimator. Then, based on these properties, we constructed an information criterion as an asymptotically bias-corrected estimator of predictive risk. In numerical experiments, we confirmed that PIIC outperforms WAIC in the sense of reducing the predictive risk, and in a real data analysis, we observed that the two criteria give rise to substantially different results.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

The model incorporates sociodemographic, environmental, and proximity-based variables to evaluate how locational suitability influences economic outcomes. Key factors considered include income, home value, elevation, PM2.5 concentration, and distances to essential services such as schools, markets, and hospitals. The MGWR model demonstrates strong performance, explaining approximately 63 percent of the variation in household wealth. Results show that proximity to markets, schools, and parks significantly increases wealth in over 40 percent of neighborhoods. In contrast, closeness to hospitals and bus stops is negatively associated with wealth, suggesting that nearby disamenities can reduce housing desirability. Strong spatial autocorrelation (Morans I = 0.53, p < 0.001) indicates that wealthier households are significantly clustered, highlighting the influence of localized factors. Overall, the study reveals that the relationship between locational suitability and household wealth is spatially variable across the county.</p></details> |  |

A significant challenge in this domain is the generalizability of preference models, particularly their efficacy in predicting preferences within environmental configurations not encountered during training. While deep learning models have shown promise in learning complex spatial and contextual dependencies, it remains unclear which neural network architectures are most effective at generalizing to unseen layouts. To address this, we conduct a comparative study of Graph Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and standard feedforward Neural Networks using synthetic data generated from a simplified and synthetic pocket park environment. Beginning with this illustrative case study, allows for controlled analysis of each model's ability to transfer learned preference patterns to unseen spatial scenarios. The models are evaluated based on their capacity to predict preferences influenced by heterogeneous physical, environmental, and social features. Generalizability score is calculated using the area under the precision-recall curve for the seen and unseen layouts. This generalizability score is appropriate for imbalanced data, providing insights into the suitability of each neural network architecture for preference-aware human behavior modeling in unseen built environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 15th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring (IWSHM)</p></details> |

Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper, we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset, self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate feature matching than the traditional method.</p></details> |  |

Accurately modeling such behavior remains challenging due to the complexity of pairwise spatial-temporal interactions and the heterogeneous influence of groupwise dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. Hyper-STTN constructs multiscale hypergraphs of varying group sizes to model groupwise correlations, captured through spectral hypergraph convolution based on random-walk probabilities. In parallel, a spatial-temporal transformer is employed to learn pedestrians' pairwise latent interactions across spatial and temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous groupwise and pairwise features are subsequently fused and aligned via a multimodal transformer. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian motion datasets demonstrate that Hyper-STTN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models.</p></details> |  |

Here, we propose MapMuse, a storytelling-based framework for interpreting spatio-temporal datasets, transforming them into compelling, narrative-driven experiences. We utilize large language models and employ retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based techniques to generate comprehensive stories. Drawing on principles common in cinematic storytelling, we emphasize clarity, emotional connection, and audience-centric design. As a case study, we analyze a dataset of taxi trajectories. Two perspectives are presented: a captivating story based on a heat map that visualizes millions of taxi trip endpoints to uncover urban mobility patterns; and a detailed narrative following a single long taxi journey, enriched with city landmarks and temporal shifts. By portraying locations as characters and movement as plot, we argue that data storytelling drives insight, engagement, and action from spatio-temporal information. The case study illustrates how MapMuse can bridge the gap between data complexity and human understanding. The aim of this short paper is to provide a glimpse to the potential of the cinematic storytelling technique as an effective communication tool for spatio-temporal data, as well as to describe open problems and opportunities for future research.</p></details> | 5 pages |

We propose COMPASS, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables decentralized agents to persistently monitor multiple moving targets efficiently. We model the environment as a graph, where nodes represent spatial locations and edges capture topological proximity, allowing agents to reason over structured layouts and revisit informative regions as needed. Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical observations and spatial context. We model target dynamics using Gaussian Processes (GPs), which support principled belief updates and enable uncertainty-aware planning. We train COMPASS using centralized value estimation and decentralized policy execution under an adaptive reward setting. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that COMPASS consistently outperforms strong baselines in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination efficiency across dynamic multi-target scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE MRS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Xiaoice: Training-Free Video Understanding via Self-Supervised Spatio-Temporal Clustering of Semantic Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16781v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive, task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments. These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content. This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.</p></details> |  |
| **[StretchySnake: Flexible SSM Training Unlocks Action Recognition Across Spatio-Temporal Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16209v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) have emerged as a competitive alternative to transformers in various tasks. Their linear complexity and hidden-state recurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences, whereas attention becomes quadratically expensive. However, current training methods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to fully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are often trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic scaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models suffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and temporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal inflexibility. In the context of action recognition, this severely limits a model's ability to retain performance across both short- and long-form videos. Therefore, we propose a flexible training method that leverages and improves the inherent adaptability of SSMs. Our method samples videos at varying temporal and spatial resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates model weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This instills our SSM, which we call StretchySnake, with spatio-temporal flexibility and enables it to seamlessly handle videos ranging from short, fine-grained clips to long, complex activities. We introduce and compare five different variants of flexible training, and identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs. On short-action (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action (COIN, Breakfast) benchmarks, StretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines alike by up to 28%, with strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). Therefore, our method provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more robust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across diverse action recognition scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

We show that STEMMED can be decomposed node-by-node, suggesting a tractable distributed learning procedure. Simulation shows that this learning algorithm can accurately recover known parameters of STEMMED, especially for small networks and long data-horizons. Next, we turn this node-by-node decomposition into an online cooperative multi-period forecasting framework, which is asymptotically robust to operational errors, to facilitate Opioid-related overdose death (OOD) trends forecasting among neighboring communities. In our numerical study, we parameterize STEMMED using individual-level OOD data and county-level demographics in Massachusetts. For any node, we observe that OODs within the same drug class from nearby locations have the greatest influence on future OOD trends. Furthermore, the expected proportion of OODs triggered by historical events varies greatly across counties, ranging between 30%-70%. Finally, in a practical online forecasting setting, STEMMED-based cooperative framework reduces prediction error by 60% on average, compared to well-established forecasting models. Leveraging the growing abundance of public health surveillance data, STEMMED can provide accurate forecasts of local OOD trends and highlight complex interactions between OODs across communities and drug types. Moreover, STEMMED enhances synergies between local and federal government entities, which is critical to designing impactful policy interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Implicit Flow Fields for Spatio-Temporal Motion Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14827v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe and efficient robot operation in complex human environments can benefit from good models of site-specific motion patterns. Maps of Dynamics (MoDs) provide such models by encoding statistical motion patterns in a map, but existing representations use discrete spatial sampling and typically require costly offline construction. We propose a continuous spatio-temporal MoD representation based on implicit neural functions that directly map coordinates to the parameters of a Semi-Wrapped Gaussian Mixture Model. This removes the need for discretization and imputation for unevenly sampled regions, enabling smooth generalization across both space and time. Evaluated on a large public dataset with long-term real-world people tracking data, our method achieves better accuracy of motion representation and smoother velocity distributions in sparse regions while still being computationally efficient, compared to available baselines. The proposed approach demonstrates a powerful and efficient way of modeling complex human motion patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[SVAG-Bench: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Multi-Instance Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13016v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking. Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG, particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cognitive-Aligned Spatio-Temporal Large Language Models For Next Point-of-Interest Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14702v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems, which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays, and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns, profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of 2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in "Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of CoAST.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

However, many approaches struggle with reliability in the target domain, an issue particularly critical in medical image segmentation, where accuracy and anatomical validity are essential. This challenge is further exacerbated in spatio-temporal data, where the lack of temporal consistency can significantly degrade segmentation quality, and particularly in echocardiography, where the presence of artifacts and noise can further hinder segmentation performance. To address these issues, we present RL4Seg3D, an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 2D + time echocardiography segmentation. RL4Seg3D integrates novel reward functions and a fusion scheme to enhance key landmark precision in its segmentations while processing full-sized input videos. By leveraging reinforcement learning for image segmentation, our approach improves accuracy, anatomical validity, and temporal consistency while also providing, as a beneficial side effect, a robust uncertainty estimator, which can be used at test time to further enhance segmentation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on over 30,000 echocardiographic videos, showing that it outperforms standard domain adaptation techniques without the need for any labels on the target domain.

| **[Long-Term Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of Monthly Rainfall in West Bengal Using Ensemble Learning Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13927v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rainfall forecasting plays a critical role in climate adaptation, agriculture, and water resource management. This study develops long-term forecasts of monthly rainfall across 19 districts of West Bengal using a century-scale dataset spanning 1900-2019. Daily rainfall records are aggregated into monthly series, resulting in 120 years of observations for each district. The forecasting task involves predicting the next 108 months (9 years, 2011-2019) while accounting for temporal dependencies and spatial interactions among districts. To address the nonlinear and complex structure of rainfall dynamics, we propose a hierarchical modeling framework that combines regression-based forecasting of yearly features with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for monthly prediction. Yearly features, such as annual totals, quarterly proportions, variability measures, skewness, and extremes, are first forecasted using regression models that incorporate both own lags and neighboring-district lags. These forecasts are then integrated as auxiliary inputs into an MLP model, which captures nonlinear temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in the monthly series. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical regression-MLP architecture provides robust long-term spatio-temporal forecasts, offering valuable insights for agriculture, irrigation planning, and water conservation strategies.</p></details> | 25 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Spatio-Temporal LLM: Reasoning about Environments and Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05258v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current MLLMs are challenged by "spatio-temporal" prompts, i.e., prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment encoded in a point cloud that the MLLM should consider; and simultaneously also refer to 2) actions that happened in part of the environment and are encoded in a short ego-centric video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this challenge, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent MLLMs indeed struggle to correctly answer "spatio-temporal" prompts. Building on this dataset, we study two spatio-temporal LLM (STLLM) baselines: 1) STLLM-3D, which directly fuses point cloud, video, and text representations as inputs to the LLM; and 2) STLLM-Aligner, which aligns spatial context with video and text before LLM decoding. Both baselines aim to enhance spatial understanding of environments and temporal grounding of egocentric observations. On REA, the STLLM baselines outperform existing models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.

| **[Learning to Recognize Correctly Completed Procedure Steps in Egocentric Assembly Videos through Spatio-Temporal Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12385v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object, while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%, respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 7 figures and 5 tables in the main paper and one figure and table in the appendix.

While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and benchmark are available.

| **[Vectorized Video Representation with Easy Editing via Hierarchical Spatio-Temporally Consistent Proxy Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12256v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability, this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand, the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally consistent video editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[State Space Prompting via Gathering and Spreading Spatio-Temporal Information for Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12160v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering (IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by 2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.</p></details> |  |

However, detecting individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts and deviations from established routines but also the identification of individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by The 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Anomaly Detection</p></details> |

Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset.

| **[PruneGCRN: Minimizing and explaining spatio-temporal problems through node pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10803v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the challenge of using a deep learning model to prune graphs and the ability of this method to integrate explainability into spatio-temporal problems through a new approach. Instead of applying explainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding of the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an optimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the training process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This integration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error while selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model searches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important elements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed approach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy obtained by pruning with the model and with other methods. The experiments demonstrate that our method is capable of retaining a greater amount of information as the graph reduces in size compared to the other methods used. These results highlight the potential of pruning as a tool for developing models capable of simplifying spatio-temporal problems, thereby obtaining their most important elements.</p></details> |  |

Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In this paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS) designed to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural processing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity patterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p neurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by pyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation velocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity. Through local interactions, these neurons produce wave-like propagation patterns. The model incorporates trainable parameters for damping and propagation speed, enabling flexible adaptation to task-specific spatio-temporal structures. We evaluate BioOSS on both synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior performance and enhanced interpretability compared to alternative architectures.</p></details> |  |

In fact, we will be using the NCAR Climate Data Gateway website which provides data discovery and access services for global and regional climate model data. The daily values of total precipitation (prec), maximum (tmax), and minimum (tmin) temperature are combined to create a multidimensional data called tensor (a multidimensional array).

We take full advantage of the spatial and temporal structure of the data in the initialization step for cp component analysis. The performance of our method is tested via comparison with most popular initialization method.

High-resolution SM can be obtained by combining coarse passive microwave data with fine-scale auxiliary variables. However, the inversion of SM at the temporal scale is hindered by the incompleteness of surface auxiliary factors. To address this issue, first, we introduce validated high temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables into the downscaling process of the low-resolution SMAP SM product. Subsequently, we design a progressive scale convolutional network (PSCNet), at the core of which are two innovative components: a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) for capturing temporal dynamics, and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block designed to preserve fine-grained spatial details. Using this approach, we obtained seamless SM products for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2016 to 2018 at 10-km spatial and 3-hour temporal resolution. The experimental results on the TP demonstrated the following: 1) In the satellite product validation, the PSCNet exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error, with a mean R value of 0.881, outperforming other methods. 2) In the in-situ site validation, PSCNet consistently ranked among the top three models for the R metric across all sites, while also showing superior performance in overall error reduction. 3) In the temporal generalization validation, the feasibility of using high-temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables for downscaling was confirmed, as all methods maintained an average relative error within 6\% for the R metric and 2\% for the ubRMSE metric. 4) In the temporal dynamics and visualization validation, PSCNet demonstrated excellent temporal sensitivity and vivid spatial details. Overall, PSCNet provides a promising solution for spatio-temporal downscaling by effectively modeling the intricate spatio-temporal relationships in SM data.</p></details> |  |

However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution (STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural, and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live, interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live, explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events (arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial advantage for a reliable decision support tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGSPATIAL 2025 - GeoAI Workshop</p></details> |

Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons, clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour) forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with 1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee, reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.</p></details> |  |

Yet capturing pore collapse, anomalous Hugoniot responses, and localized heating - phenomena that strongly influence asteroid deflection or fusion ignition - has remained a major challenge despite recent advances in single-field and reduced representations. We introduce a multi-field spatio-temporal model (MSTM) that unifies seven coupled fields - pressure, density, temperature, energy, material distribution, and two velocity components - into a single autoregressive surrogate. Trained on high-fidelity hydrocode data, MSTM captures nonlinear shock-driven dynamics across porous and architected configurations, achieving mean errors of 1.4% and 3.2% respectively, all while delivering over three orders of magnitude in speedup. MSTM reduces mean-squared error and structural dissimilarity by 94% relative torelative to single-field spatio-temporal models. This advance transforms problems once considered intractable into tractable design studies, establishing a practical framework for optimizing meso-structured materials in planetary impact mitigation and inertial fusion energy.</p></details> | 19 pages, 12 figures |

The proposed approach combines ADMM-based optimization with INCODE, a conditioning framework incorporating prior knowledge, to enable efficient convergence. We evaluate our method under diverse acquisition scenarios, varying the severity of global undersampling, spatial complexity (quantified via spatial information), and noise levels. Across all settings, our model achieves strong performance and outperforms Time-Interlaced Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (TIMBIR), a state-of-the-art model-based iterative method. In particular, we show that the inductive bias of the INR provides good robustness to moderate noise levels, and that introducing explicit noise modeling through a weighted least squares data fidelity term significantly improves performance in more challenging regimes. The final part of this work explores extensions toward a practical reconstruction framework. We demonstrate the modularity of our approach by explicitly modeling detector non-idealities, incorporating ring artifact correction directly within the reconstruction process. Additionally, we present a proof-of-concept 4D volumetric reconstruction by jointly optimizing over batched axial slices, an approach which opens up the possibilities for massive parallelization, a critical feature for processing large-scale datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Different from the Past? Spatio-Temporal Time Series Forecasting with Self-Supervised Deviation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04908v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is essential for real-world applications such as traffic management and urban computing. Although recent methods have shown improved accuracy, they often fail to account for dynamic deviations between current inputs and historical patterns. These deviations contain critical signals that can significantly affect model performance. To fill this gap, we propose ST-SSDL, a Spatio-Temporal time series forecasting framework that incorporates a Self-Supervised Deviation Learning scheme to capture and utilize such deviations. ST-SSDL anchors each input to its historical average and discretizes the latent space using learnable prototypes that represent typical spatio-temporal patterns. Two auxiliary objectives are proposed to refine this structure: a contrastive loss that enhances inter-prototype discriminability and a deviation loss that regularizes the distance consistency between input representations and corresponding prototypes to quantify deviation. Optimized jointly with the forecasting objective, these components guide the model to organize its hidden space and improve generalization across diverse input conditions. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show that ST-SSDL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics. Visualizations further demonstrate its ability to adaptively respond to varying levels of deviation in complex spatio-temporal scenarios.

In practice, a transformer-based Seq-VPR model should be flexible to the number of frames per sequence (seq-length), deliver fast inference, and have low memory usage to meet real-time constraints. To our knowledge, no existing transformer-based Seq-VPR method achieves both flexibility and efficiency. To address this gap, we propose Adapt-STformer, a Seq-VPR method built around our novel Recurrent Deformable Transformer Encoder (Recurrent-DTE), which uses an iterative recurrent mechanism to fuse information from multiple sequential frames. This design naturally supports variable seq-lengths, fast inference, and low memory usage. Experiments on the Nordland, Oxford, and NuScenes datasets show that Adapt-STformer boosts recall by up to 17% while reducing sequence extraction time by 36% and lowering memory usage by 35% compared to the second-best baseline.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[FieldFormer: Physics-Informed Transformers for Spatio-Temporal Field Reconstruction from Sparse Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03589v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal sensor data is often sparse, noisy, and irregular, and existing interpolation or learning methods struggle here because they either ignore governing PDEs or do not scale. We introduce FieldFormer, a transformer-based framework for mesh-free spatio-temporal field reconstruction that combines data-driven flexibility with physics-based structure. For each query, FieldFormer gathers a local neighborhood using a learnable velocity-scaled distance metric, enabling anisotropic adaptation to different propagation regimes. Neighborhoods are built efficiently via per-batch offset recomputation, and refined in an expectation-maximization style as the velocity scales evolve. Predictions are made by a local transformer encoder, and physics consistency is enforced through autograd-based PDE residuals and boundary-specific penalties. Across three benchmarks--a scalar anisotropic heat equation, a vector-valued shallow-water system, and a realistic advection-diffusion pollution simulation--FieldFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines by more than 40%. Our results demonstrate that FieldFormer enables accurate (RMSE$<10^{-2}$), efficient, and physically consistent field reconstruction from sparse (0.4%-2%) and noisy(10%) data.</p></details> |  |

Accurate predictions are important for applications including motion planning, tracking, human-robot interaction, and safety monitoring. In this paper, we exploit Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), which encode spatial or spatio-temporal motion patterns as environment features, to achieve LHMP for horizons of up to 60 seconds. We propose an MoD-informed LHMP framework that supports various types of MoDs and includes a ranking method to output the most likely predicted trajectory, improving practical utility in robotics. Further, a time-conditioned MoD is introduced to capture motion patterns that vary across different times of day. We evaluate MoD-LHMP instantiated with three types of MoDs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that MoD-informed method outperforms learning-based ones, with up to 50\% improvement in average displacement error, and the time-conditioned variant achieves the highest accuracy overall.

The factor can be specified as spatially varying or spatially constant, and the scale parameter incorporates scientifically relevant covariates (e.g., longitude, latitude, altitude), enabling flexible representation of geographic heterogeneity. To avoid the computational burden of the full censored likelihood, we design a Gibbs sampler that embeds amortized neural posterior estimation within each parameter block, yielding scalable inference with full posterior uncertainty for parameters, predictive quantiles, and return levels. Simulation studies demonstrate that the approach improves MCMC mixing and estimation accuracy relative to baseline specifications, particularly when using moderately more complex network architectures, while preserving heavy-tail behavior. We illustrate the methodology with daily precipitation in Guanacaste, Costa Rica, evaluating a suite of nested models and selecting the best-performing factor combination via out-of-sample diagnostics. The chosen specification reveals coherent spatial patterns in multi-year return periods and provides actionable information for infrastructure planning and climate-risk management in a tropical dry region strongly influenced by climatic factors. The proposed Gibbs scheme generalizes to other settings where parameters can be partitioned into inferentially homogeneous blocks and conditionals learned via amortized, likelihood-free methods.</p></details> |  |

While standard architectures like ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT), a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing for reviewing</p></details> |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from exogenous stochastic processes. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |
| **[UrbanGraph: Physics-Informed Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Heterogeneous Graphs for Urban Microclimate Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00457v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical, as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this, we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. It encodes key physical processes -- vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0% over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and 7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Automated Spatio-Semantic Analysis in Picture Description Using Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05128v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current methods for automated assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment via picture description often neglect the visual narrative path - the sequence and locations of elements a speaker described in the picture. Analyses of spatio-semantic features capture this path using content information units (CIUs), but manual tagging or dictionary-based mapping is labor-intensive. This study proposes a BERT-based pipeline, fine tuned with binary cross-entropy and pairwise ranking loss, for automated CIU extraction and ordering from the Cookie Theft picture description. Evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation, it achieves 93% median precision, 96% median recall in CIU detection, and 24% sequence error rates. The proposed method extracts features that exhibit strong Pearson correlations with ground truth, surpassing the dictionary-based baseline in external validation. These features also perform comparably to those derived from manual annotations in evaluating group differences via ANCOVA. The pipeline is shown to effectively characterize visual narrative paths for cognitive impairment assessment, with the implementation and models open-sourced to public.</p></details> |  |
| **[STaR-Attack: A Spatio-Temporal and Narrative Reasoning Attack Framework for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26473v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically, our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability. STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates, forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety alignments in UMMs.</p></details> |  |

The majority of existing placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Behavioural Classification in C. elegans: a Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00086v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 1mm roundworm C. elegans is a model organism used in many sub-areas of biology to investigate different types of biological processes. In order to complement the n-vivo analysis with computer-based investigations, several methods have been proposed to simulate the worm behaviour. These methods extract discrete behavioural units from the flow of the worm movements using different types of tracking techniques. Nevertheless, these techniques require a clear view of the entire worm body, which is not always achievable. For example, this happens in high density worm conditions, which are particularly informative to understand the influence of the social context on the single worm behaviour. In this paper, we illustrate and evaluate a method to extract behavioural units from recordings of C. elegans movements which do not necessarily require a clear view of the entire worm body. Moreover, the behavioural units are defined by an unsupervised automatic pipeline which frees the process from predefined assumptions that inevitably bias the behavioural analysis. The behavioural units resulting from the automatic method are interpreted by comparing them with hand-designed behavioural units. The effectiveness of the automatic method is evaluated by measuring the extent to which the movement of a simulated worm, with an agent-based model, matches the movement of a natural worm. Our results indicate that spatio-temporal locomotory patterns emerge even from single point worm tracking. Moreover, we show that such patterns represent a fundamental aspect of the behavioural classification process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23447v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS), the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However, a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network (HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1) spectral encoder module; 2) spatial encoder module; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter encoder module; 4) CR adapter decoder module; 5) spatial decoder module; and 6) spectral decoder module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on three HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models, surpassing the state of the art by up to 2.36 dB in terms of PSNR. Based on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .</p></details> |  |

However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |

Traditional spot trading suffers from negotiation delays and high energy costs, while conventional futures trading struggles to adapt to the dynamic, uncertain UAV-edge environment. To address these challenges, we propose PAST (pilot-and-adaptive stable trading), a novel framework for edge-assisted UAV networks with spatio-temporal dynamism. PAST integrates two complementary mechanisms: PilotAO (pilot trading agreements with overbooking), a risk-aware, overbooking-enabled early-stage decision-making module that establishes long-term, mutually beneficial agreements and boosts resource utilization; and AdaptAO (adaptive trading agreements with overbooking rate update), an intelligent adaptation module that dynamically updates agreements and overbooking rates based on UAV mobility, supply-demand variations, and agreement performance. Together, these mechanisms enable both stability and flexibility, guaranteeing individual rationality, strong stability, competitive equilibrium, and weak Pareto optimality. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that PAST consistently outperforms benchmark methods in decision-making overhead, task completion latency, resource utilization, and social welfare. By combining predictive planning with real-time adjustments, PAST offers a valuable reference on robust and adaptive practice for improving low-altitude mission performance.</p></details> |  |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities.

Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

This sole focus on efficacy has steered development of large-scale models that require massive resources, and results in considerable carbon footprint across the model life-cycle. In this work, we explore how physics inductive biases can offer useful trade-offs between model efficacy and model efficiency (compute, energy, and carbon). We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for spatio-temporal forecasting. Our experiments show that incorporating physics inductive biases offer a principled way to improve the efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of machine learning models. We argue that model efficiency, along with model efficacy, should become a core consideration driving machine learning model development and deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code available at https://github.com/sophiawilson18/FlowMatching</p></details> |

However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework. Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points. Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, in dynamic remote scenes, transmission latency during bidirectional communication creates gaps between remote perceived states and operator intent, leading to command misunderstanding and incorrect execution. To mitigate this, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph (ST-OVSG), a representation that enriches open-vocabulary perception with temporal dynamics and lightweight latency annotations. ST-OVSG leverages LVLMs to construct open-vocabulary 3D object representations, and extends them into the temporal domain via Hungarian assignment with our temporal matching cost, yielding a unified spatio-temporal scene graph. A latency tag is embedded to enable LVLM planners to retrospectively query past scene states, thereby resolving local-remote state mismatches caused by transmission delays. To further reduce redundancy and highlight task-relevant cues, we propose a task-oriented subgraph filtering strategy that produces compact inputs for the planner. ST-OVSG generalizes to novel categories and enhances planning robustness against transmission latency without requiring fine-tuning. Experiments show that our method achieves 74 percent node accuracy on the Replica benchmark, outperforming ConceptGraph.

However, they neglect the high spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba, and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements. Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3% on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be available.</p></details> |  |

While earlier approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in this critical domain.</p></details> |  |

However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</p></details> |  |
| **[A sub-hourly spatio-temporal statistical model for solar irradiance in Ireland using open-source data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21041v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of solar irradiance is essential for reliable modelling of solar photovoltaic (PV) power production. In Ireland's highly variable maritime climate, where ground-based measurement stations are sparsely distributed, selecting an appropriate solar irradiance dataset presents a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling framework for predicting solar irradiance at hourly and sub-hourly (10-minute) resolutions across Ireland. Cross-validation demonstrates that our model is statistically robust across all temporal resolutions with hourly showing highest prediction precision whereas 10-minute resolution encounters higher errors but better uncertainty quantification. In separate evaluations, we compare our model against alternative data sources, including reanalysis datasets and nearest-station interpolation, and find that it consistently provides superior site-specific accuracy. At the hourly scale, our model outperforms ERA5 in agreement with ground-based observations. At the sub-hourly scale, 10-minute resolution estimates provide solar PV power outputs consistent with residential and industrial solar PV installations in Ireland. Beyond surpassing existing datasets, our model delivers full uncertainty quantification, scalability and the capacity for real-time implementation, offering a powerful tool for solar energy prediction and the estimation of losses due to overload clipping from inverter undersizing.</p></details> |  |

The physical layer maps the geographic movement of individuals, while the information layer tracks the spread of knowledge and health behavior via social interactions. We explore the interplay between physical mobility, information flow, and epidemic outcomes by simulating disease spread within this dual-structured network. Our model employs stochastic elements to mirror human behavior, mobility, and information dissemination uncertainties. Through simulations, we assess the impact of network structure, mobility patterns, and information spread speed on epidemic dynamics. The findings highlight the crucial role of effective communication in curbing disease transmission, even in highly mobile societies. Additionally, our agent-based simulation allows for real-time scenario analysis through a user interface, offering insights into leveraging physical and informational networks for epidemic control. This research sheds light on designing strategic interventions in complex social systems to manage disease outbreaks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph Learning for Account Takeover Fraud Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20339v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Account Takeover (ATO) fraud poses a significant challenge in consumer banking, requiring high recall under strict latency while minimizing friction for legitimate users. Production systems typically rely on tabular gradient-boosted decision trees (e.g., XGBoost) that score sessions independently, overlooking the relational and temporal structure of online activity that characterizes coordinated attacks and "fraud rings." We introduce ATLAS (Account Takeover Learning Across Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph), a framework that reformulates ATO detection as spatio-temporal node classification on a time-respecting directed session graph. ATLAS links entities via shared identifiers (account, device, IP) and regulates connectivity with time-window and recency constraints, enabling causal, time-respecting message passing and latency-aware label propagation that uses only labels available at scoring time, non-anticipative and leakage-free. We operationalize ATLAS with inductive GraphSAGE variants trained via neighbor sampling, at scale on a sessions graph with more than 100M nodes and around 1B edges. On a high-risk digital product at Capital One, ATLAS delivers 6.38 percent AUC improvement and more than 50 percent reduction in customer friction, improving fraud capture while reducing user friction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at NeurIPS 2025 workshop New Perspective in Graph Machine Learning (NPGML)</p></details> |
| **[DP-LET: An Efficient Spatio-Temporal Network Traffic Prediction Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03792v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting spatio-temporal network traffic is essential for dynamically managing computing resources in modern communication systems and minimizing energy consumption. Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation to the 2025 IEEE Global Communications Conference (IEEE GLOBECOM)</p></details> |

Efficient compression and representation are crucial for analyzing complex motion dynamics. In this work, we introduce an adversarially-refined VQ-GAN framework with dense motion tokenization for compressing spatio-temporal heatmaps while preserving the fine-grained traces of human motion. Our approach combines dense motion tokenization with adversarial refinement, which eliminates reconstruction artifacts like motion smearing and temporal misalignment observed in non-adversarial baselines. Our experiments on the CMU Panoptic dataset provide conclusive evidence of our method's superiority, outperforming the dVAE baseline by 9.31% SSIM and reducing temporal instability by 37.1%. Furthermore, our dense tokenization strategy enables a novel analysis of motion complexity, revealing that 2D motion can be optimally represented with a compact 128-token vocabulary, while 3D motion's complexity demands a much larger 1024-token codebook for faithful reconstruction. These results establish practical deployment feasibility across diverse motion analysis applications.

| **[GSTM-HMU: Generative Spatio-Temporal Modeling for Human Mobility Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19135v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility traces, often recorded as sequences of check-ins, provide a unique window into both short-term visiting patterns and persistent lifestyle regularities. In this work we introduce GSTM-HMU, a generative spatio-temporal framework designed to advance mobility analysis by explicitly modeling the semantic and temporal complexity of human movement. The framework consists of four key innovations. First, a Spatio-Temporal Concept Encoder (STCE) integrates geographic location, POI category semantics, and periodic temporal rhythms into unified vector representations. Second, a Cognitive Trajectory Memory (CTM) adaptively filters historical visits, emphasizing recent and behaviorally salient events in order to capture user intent more effectively. Third, a Lifestyle Concept Bank (LCB) contributes structured human preference cues, such as activity types and lifestyle patterns, to enhance interpretability and personalization. Finally, task-oriented generative heads transform the learned representations into predictions for multiple downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely used real-world datasets, including Gowalla, WeePlace, Brightkite, and FourSquare, and evaluate performance on three benchmark tasks: next-location prediction, trajectory-user identification, and time estimation. The results demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements over strong baselines, confirming the effectiveness of GSTM-HMU in extracting semantic regularities from complex mobility data. Beyond raw performance gains, our findings also suggest that generative modeling provides a promising foundation for building more robust, interpretable, and generalizable systems for human mobility intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches, including spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs), often face high memory demands and struggle to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies, limiting their efficiency in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce DynSTG-Mamba (Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Mamba), a novel framework that combines DF-STGNN and STG-Mamba to enhance motion sequence modeling. The DF-STGNN incorporates a dynamic spatio-temporal filter that adaptively adjusts spatial connections between skeletal joints and temporal interactions across different movement phases. This approach ensures better feature propagation through dynamic graph structures by considering the hierarchical nature and dynamics of skeletal gait data. Meanwhile, STG-Mamba, an extension of Mamba adapted for skeletal motion data, ensures a continuous propagation of states, facilitating the capture of long-term dependencies while reducing computational complexity. To reduce the number of model parameters and computational costs while maintaining consistency, we propose Cross-Graph Relational Knowledge Distillation, a novel knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns relational information between teacher (large architecture) and student models (small architecture) while using shared memory. This ensures that the interactions and movement patterns of the joints are accurately preserved in the motion sequences. We validate our DynSTG-Mamba on KOA-NM, PD-WALK, and ATAXIA datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and Recall. Our results highlight the efficiency and robustness of our approach, offering a lightweight yet highly accurate solution for automated gait analysis and movement disorder assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>After...</summary><p>After receiving detailed feedback from journalreviewers, we identified limitations in the initial approach and substantially improved the methodology and contributions of the work.

| **[Deformable Dynamic Convolution for Accurate yet Efficient Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11550v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is a critical component of intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion mitigation and accident risk prediction. While recent research has explored both graph-based and grid-based approaches, key limitations remain. Graph-based methods effectively capture non-Euclidean spatial structures but often incur high computational overhead, limiting their practicality in large-scale systems. In contrast, grid-based methods, which primarily leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offer greater computational efficiency but struggle to model irregular spatial patterns due to the fixed shape of their filters. Moreover, both approaches often fail to account for inherent spatio-temporal heterogeneity, as they typically apply a shared set of parameters across diverse regions and time periods. To address these challenges, we propose the Deformable Dynamic Convolutional Network (DDCN), a novel CNN-based architecture that integrates both deformable and dynamic convolution operations. The deformable layer introduces learnable offsets to create flexible receptive fields that better align with spatial irregularities, while the dynamic layer generates region-specific filters, allowing the model to adapt to varying spatio-temporal traffic patterns. By combining these two components, DDCN effectively captures both non-Euclidean spatial structures and spatio-temporal heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that DDCN achieves competitive predictive performance while significantly reducing computational costs, underscoring its potential for large-scale and real-time deployment.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

It employs an online data quality monitoring (DQM) system to promptly spot and diagnose particle data acquisition problems to avoid data quality loss. In this study, we present a semi-supervised spatio-temporal anomaly detection (AD) monitoring system for the physics particle reading channels of the Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) of the CMS using three-dimensional digi-occupancy map data of the DQM. We propose the GraphSTAD system, which employs convolutional and graph neural networks to learn local spatial characteristics induced by particles traversing the detector and the global behavior owing to shared backend circuit connections and housing boxes of the channels, respectively. Recurrent neural networks capture the temporal evolution of the extracted spatial features. We validate the accuracy of the proposed AD system in capturing diverse channel fault types using the LHC collision data sets. The GraphSTAD system achieves production-level accuracy and is being integrated into the CMS core production system for real-time monitoring of the HCAL. We provide a quantitative performance comparison with alternative benchmark models to demonstrate the promising leverage of the presented system.

| **[Spatio-temporal Dynamical Indices for Complex Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10069v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex systems span multiple spatial and temporal scales, making their dynamics challenging to understand and predict. This challenge is especially daunting when one wants to study localized and/or rare events. Advances in dynamical systems theory, including the development of state-dependent dynamical indices, namely local dimension and persistence, have provided powerful tools for studying these phenomena. However, existing applications of such indices rely on a predefined and fixed spatial domain, that provides a single scalar quantity for the entire region of interest. This aspect prevents understanding the spatially localized dynamical behavior of the system. In this work, we introduce Spatio-temporal Dynamical Indices (SDIs), that leverage the existing framework of state-dependent local dimension and persistence. SDIs are obtained via a sliding window approach, enabling the exploration of space-dependent properties in spatio-temporal data. As an example, we show that, through this framework, we are able to reconcile previously different perspectives on European summertime heatwaves. This result showcases the importance of accounting for spatial scales when performing scale-dependent dynamical analyses.</p></details> |  |
| **[StFT: Spatio-temporal Fourier Transformer for Long-term Dynamics Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11899v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating the long-term dynamics of multi-scale and multi-physics systems poses a significant challenge in understanding complex phenomena across science and engineering. The complexity arises from the intricate interactions between scales and the interplay of diverse physical processes, which manifest in PDEs through coupled, nonlinear terms that govern the evolution of multiple physical fields across scales. Neural operators have shown potential in short-term prediction of such complex spatio-temporal dynamics; however, achieving stable high-fidelity predictions and providing robust uncertainty quantification over extended time horizons remains an open and unsolved area of research. These limitations often lead to stability degradation with rapid error accumulation, particularly in long-term forecasting of systems characterized by multi-scale behaviors involving dynamics of different orders. To address these challenges, we propose an autoregressive Spatio-temporal Fourier Transformer (StFT), in which each transformer block is designed to learn the system dynamics at a distinct scale through a dual-path architecture that integrates frequency-domain and spatio-temporal representations. By leveraging a structured hierarchy of \ours blocks, the resulting model explicitly captures the underlying dynamics across both macro- and micro- spatial scales. Furthermore, a generative residual correction mechanism is introduced to learn a probabilistic refinement temporally while simultaneously quantifying prediction uncertainties, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of long-term probabilistic forecasting. Evaluations conducted on three benchmark datasets (plasma, fluid, and atmospheric dynamics) demonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art ML methods.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Unleashing the Potential of Multimodal LLMs for Zero-Shot Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15178v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal tube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot solution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to dynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \textit{grounding tokens}, for grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal grounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query (\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and temporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token predictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and temporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods on three common STVG benchmarks. The code will be available at https://github.com/zaiquanyang/LLaVA_Next_STVG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian inference for spatio-temporal hidden Markov models using the exchange algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15164v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal hidden Markov models are extremely difficult to estimate because their latent joint distributions are available only in trivial cases. In the estimation phase, these latent distributions are usually substituted with pseudo-distributions, which could affect the estimation results, in particular in the presence of strong dependence between the latent variables. In this work, we propose a spatio-temporal hidden Markov model where the latent process is an extension of the autologistic model. We show how inference can be carried out in a Bayesian framework using an approximate exchange algorithm, which circumvents the impractical calculations of the normalizing constants that arise in the model. Our proposed method leads to a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler that targets the correct posterior distribution of the model and not a pseudo-posterior. In addition, we develop a new initialization approach for the approximate exchange method, reducing the computational time of the algorithm. An extensive simulation study shows that the approximate exchange algorithm generally outperforms the pseudo-distribution approach, yielding more accurate parameter estimates. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to a real-world case study analyzing rainfall levels across Italian regions over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Marginals: Learning Joint Spatio-Temporal Patterns for Multivariate Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15033v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we aim to improve multivariate anomaly detection (AD) by modeling the \textit{time-varying non-linear spatio-temporal correlations} found in multivariate time series data . In multivariate time series data, an anomaly may be indicated by the simultaneous deviation of interrelated time series from their expected collective behavior, even when no individual time series exhibits a clearly abnormal pattern on its own. In many existing approaches, time series variables are assumed to be (conditionally) independent, which oversimplifies real-world interactions. Our approach addresses this by modeling joint dependencies in the latent space and decoupling the modeling of \textit{marginal distributions, temporal dynamics, and inter-variable dependencies}. We use a transformer encoder to capture temporal patterns, and to model spatial (inter-variable) dependencies, we fit a multi-variate likelihood and a copula. The temporal and the spatial components are trained jointly in a latent space using a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to learn meaningful feature representations to separate normal and anomaly samples.</p></details> |  |

However, forecasting future deformation from sparse Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series data remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework that transforms these sparse point measurements into a dense spatio-temporal tensor. This methodological shift allows, for the first time, the direct application of advanced computer vision architectures to this forecasting problem. We design and implement a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, specifically engineered to simultaneously learn spatial patterns and temporal dependencies from the generated data tensor. The model's performance is benchmarked against powerful machine learning baselines, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and LASSO regression, using Sentinel-1 data from eastern Ireland. Results demonstrate that the proposed architecture provides significantly more accurate and spatially coherent forecasts, establishing a new performance benchmark for this task. Furthermore, an interpretability analysis reveals that baseline models often default to simplistic persistence patterns, highlighting the necessity of our integrated spatio-temporal approach to capture the complex dynamics of ground deformation.

In recent research, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising method, but their intrinsic design, tailored primarily for sequential token processing, introduces notable challenges in effectively capturing spatial dependencies. Specifically, the inherent limitations of LLMs in modeling spatial relationships and their architectural incompatibility with graph-structured spatial data remain largely unaddressed. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ST-LINK, a novel framework that enhances the capability of Large Language Models to capture spatio-temporal dependencies. Its key components are Spatially-Enhanced Attention (SE-Attention) and the Memory Retrieval Feed-Forward Network (MRFFN). SE-Attention extends rotary position embeddings to integrate spatial correlations as direct rotational transformations within the attention mechanism. This approach maximizes spatial learning while preserving the LLM's inherent sequential processing structure. Meanwhile, MRFFN dynamically retrieves and utilizes key historical patterns to capture complex temporal dependencies and improve the stability of long-term forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-LINK surpasses conventional deep learning and LLM approaches, and effectively captures both regular traffic patterns and abrupt changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, Accepted to CIKM 2025.

| **[AdaSTI: Conditional Diffusion Models with Adaptive Dependency Modeling for Spatio-Temporal Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18144v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal data abounds in domain like traffic and environmental monitoring. However, it often suffers from missing values due to sensor malfunctions, transmission failures, etc. Recent years have seen continued efforts to improve spatio-temporal data imputation performance. Recently diffusion models have outperformed other approaches in various tasks, including spatio-temporal imputation, showing competitive performance. Extracting and utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies as conditional information is vital in diffusion-based methods. However, previous methods introduce error accumulation in this process and ignore the variability of the dependencies in the noisy data at different diffusion steps. In this paper, we propose AdaSTI (Adaptive Dependency Model in Diffusion-based Spatio-Temporal Imputation), a novel spatio-temporal imputation approach based on conditional diffusion model. Inside AdaSTI, we propose a BiS4PI network based on a bi-directional S4 model for pre-imputation with the imputed result used to extract conditional information by our designed Spatio-Temporal Conditionalizer (STC)network. We also propose a Noise-Aware Spatio-Temporal (NAST) network with a gated attention mechanism to capture the variant dependencies across diffusion steps. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that AdaSTI outperforms existing methods in all the settings, with up to 46.4% reduction in imputation error.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Building on these developments, we introduce the identifiable autoregressive variational autoencoder, which ensures the identifiability of latent components consisting of nonstationary autoregressive processes. The blind source separation efficacy of the proposed method is showcased through a simulation study, where it is compared against state-of-the-art methods, and the spatio-temporal prediction performance is evaluated against several competitors on air pollution and weather datasets.</p></details> |  |

Based on the EEG signals from four frontal lobe channels, the network aims to generate virtual channel EEG signals for other 13 important brain regions. The architecture of the network is a two-dimensional convolutional neural network and it includes a parallel module for temporal and spatial domain feature extraction, followed by a feature fusion module. The public PRED+CT database, which includes multi-channel EEG signals from 119 subjects, was selected to verify the constructed network. The results showed that the average correlation coefficient between the generated virtual channel EEG signals and the original real signals was 0.6724, with an average absolute error of 3.9470. Furthermore, the 13 virtual channel EEG signals were combined with the original EEG signals of four brain regions and then used for anxiety classification with a support vector machine. The results indicate that the virtual EEG signals generated by the constructed network not only have a high degree of consistency with the real channel EEG signals but also significantly enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms for anxiety classification. This study effectively alleviates the problem of insufficient information acquisition by portable EEG devices with few channels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Classification of Nitrogen Stress Severity in Plants Under Combined Stress Conditions Using Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06625v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses, both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment. Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral, and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data, document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low, medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies. We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop management and improved plant health.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 7 Tables</p></details> |

Many research works, including Potential Outcome Model and Structural Causal Model, have been proposed to realize it. However, their modelings, theoretical foundations and application approaches are usually different. Moreover, there is a lack of graphical approach to infer spatio-temporal counterfactuals, that considers spatial and temporal interactions between multiple units. Thus, in this work, our aim is to investigate a survey to compare and discuss different counterfactual models, theories and approaches, and further build a unified graphical causal frameworks to infer the spatio-temporal counterfactuals.</p></details> | in press |
| **[Mechanistic Learning with Guided Diffusion Models to Predict Spatio-Temporal Brain Tumor Growth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09610v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time predictions that account for mechanistic priors.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[A Zero-Inflated Spatio-Temporal Model for Integrating Fishery-Dependent and Independent Data under Preferential Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09336v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sustainable management of marine ecosystems is vital for maintaining healthy fishery resources, and benefits from advanced scientific tools to accurately assess species distribution patterns. In fisheries science, two primary data sources are used: fishery-independent data (FID), collected through systematic surveys, and fishery-dependent data (FDD), obtained from commercial fishing activities. While these sources provide complementary information, their distinct sampling schemes - systematic for FID and preferential for FDD - pose significant integration challenges. This study introduces a novel spatio-temporal model that integrates FID and FDD, addressing challenges associated with zero-inflation and preferential sampling (PS) common in ecological data. The model employs a six-layer structure to differentiate between presence-absence and biomass observations, offering a robust framework for ecological studies affected by PS biases. Simulation results demonstrate the model's accuracy in parameter estimation across diverse PS scenarios and its ability to detect preferential signals. Application to the study of the distribution patterns of the European sardine populations along the southern Portuguese continental shelf illustrates the model's effectiveness in integrating diverse data sources and incorporating environmental and vessel-specific covariates. The model reveals spatio-temporal variability in sardine presence and biomass, providing actionable insights for fisheries management. Beyond ecology, this framework offers broad applicability to data integration challenges in other disciplines.</p></details> |  |
| **[DyC-STG: Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network for Real-time Data Credibility Analysis in IoT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06483v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wide spreading of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors generates vast spatio-temporal data streams, but ensuring data credibility is a critical yet unsolved challenge for applications like smart homes. While spatio-temporal graph (STG) models are a leading paradigm for such data, they often fall short in dynamic, human-centric environments due to two fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on static graph topologies, which fail to capture physical, event-driven dynamics, and (2) their tendency to confuse spurious correlations with true causality, undermining robustness in human-centric environments. To address these gaps, we propose the Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (DyC-STG), a novel framework designed for real-time data credibility analysis in IoT. Our framework features two synergistic contributions: an event-driven dynamic graph module that adapts the graph topology in real-time to reflect physical state changes, and a causal reasoning module to distill causally-aware representations by strictly enforcing temporal precedence. To facilitate the research in this domain we release two new real-world datasets. Comprehensive experiments show that DyC-STG establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving an F1-Score of up to 0.930.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks Approach for Predicting Silent Data Corruption inducing Circuit-Level Faults](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06289v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Silent Data Errors (SDEs) from time-zero defects and aging degrade safety-critical systems. Functional testing detects SDE-related faults but is expensive to simulate. We present a unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) for fast, accurate prediction of long-cycle fault impact probabilities (FIPs) in large sequential circuits, supporting quantitative risk assessment. Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to capture topology and signal timing; dedicated spatial and temporal encoders predict multi-cycle FIPs efficiently. On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). The framework accepts features from testability metrics or fault simulation, allowing efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. A test-point selection study shows that choosing observation points by predicted FIPs improves detection of long-cycle, hard-to-detect faults. The approach scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization and fits downstream electronic design automation flows.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, plan to submit to ACM TODAES</p></details> |

Traditional input modalities, such as Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements. Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network (MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI, comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures (VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety of applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the precise and efficient decoding of MI remains challenging due to their non-stationary nature and low signal-to-noise ratio. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end deep learning framework of Discriminative Residual Dense Convolutional Autoencoder with Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (DRDCAE-STGNN) to enhance the MI feature learning and classification. Specifically, the DRDCAE module leverages residual-dense connections to learn discriminative latent representations through joint reconstruction and classifica-tion, while the STGNN module captures dynamic spatial dependencies via a learnable graph adjacency matrix and models temporal dynamics using bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM). Extensive evaluations on BCI Competition IV 2a, 2b, and PhysioNet datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 95.42%, 97.51%, and 90.15%, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component, and interpreta-bility analysis reveals neurophysiologically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, despite its complexity, the model maintains a feasible parameter count and an inference time of 0.32 ms per sample. These results indicate that our method offers a robust, accurate, and interpretable solution for MI-EEG decoding, with strong generalizability across subjects and tasks and meeting the requirements for potential real-time BCI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to IEEE Journal</p></details> |
| **[Select, then Balance: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Exogenous-Aware Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05779v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting aims to predict the future state of dynamic systems and plays an important role in multiple fields. However, existing solutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target variables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into the model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to promote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two challenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the target system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and future variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \model, a novel framework for modeling \underline{exo}genous variables in \underline{s}patio-\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select, then balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated expert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent space to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized sub-experts. Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which recomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs are integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic balance during the modeling process. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency of our proposed framework.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

| **[Parking Availability Prediction via Fusing Multi-Source Data with A Self-Supervised Learning Enhanced Spatio-Temporal Inverted Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04362v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of private car ownership has worsened the urban parking predicament, underscoring the need for accurate and effective parking availability prediction to support urban planning and management. To address key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro) contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling spatial dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures, under review for journal publication</p></details> |

Specifically, we model the observations by two weakly time-stationary point processes with spatial intensity measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ over the expanding window $(0,t]$ as $t$ increases to infinity, and establish sharp convergence rates of the empirical UOT in terms of the intrinsic dimensions of the measures. We assume a sub-quadratic temporal growth condition of the variance of the process, which allows for a wide range of temporal dependencies. As the growth approaches quadratic, the convergence rate becomes slower. This variance assumption is related to the time-reduced factorial covariance measure, and we exemplify its validity for various point processes, including the Poisson cluster, Hawkes, Neyman-Scott, and log-Gaussian Cox processes. Complementary to our upper bounds, we also derive matching lower bounds for various spatio-temporal point processes of interest and establish near minimax rate optimality of the empirical Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally, 76 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

Despite the numerous algorithms proposed with different DL architectures, maintaining a balance among performance, computational complexity, and multi-source ECG feature fusion remains challenging. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across various fields. Their inherent design for high-efficiency computation and linear complexity makes them particularly suitable for low-dimensional data like ECGs. This work proposes S2M2ECG, an SSM architecture featuring three-level fusion mechanisms: (1) Spatio-temporal bi-directional SSMs with segment tokenization for low-level signal fusion, (2) Intra-lead temporal information fusion with bi-directional scanning to enhance recognition accuracy in both forward and backward directions, (3) Cross-lead feature interaction modules for spatial information fusion. To fully leverage the ECG-specific multi-lead mechanisms inherent in ECG signals, a multi-branch design and lead fusion modules are incorporated, enabling individual analysis of each lead while ensuring seamless integration with others. Experimental results reveal that S2M2ECG achieves superior performance in the rhythmic, morphological, and clinical scenarios. Moreover, its lightweight architecture ensures it has nearly the fewest parameters among existing models, making it highly suitable for efficient inference and convenient deployment. Collectively, S2M2ECG offers a promising alternative that strikes an excellent balance among performance, computational complexity, and ECG-specific characteristics, paving the way for high-performance, lightweight computations in CVD diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Sequential Ordinal Models: Application to Invasive Weeds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01976v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multivariate sequential ordinal model is investigated for use in the Bayesian analysis of spatio-temporal ordinal data. The sequential ordinal model likelihood is equivalent to a binary model conditional on unknown regression coefficients and spatio-temporal random effects. Therefore, estimation and prediction in the space-time context can proceed using the well-established dynamic generalised linear model framework. Moreover, the sequential ordinal model avoids the ordering constraints on the threshold parameters that determine the category break points required by cumulative ordinal models, and so simplifies the estimation procedure for high-dimensional space-time applications using Bayesian inference. The dynamic spatio-temporal sequential ordinal model is applied to estimate foliage cover abundance of four actively managed invasive alien species. These invasive weed species are observed by means of a modified Braun-Blanquet score that is commonly used in vegetation studies and constitutes ordinal data. The multivariate ordinal data for the managed weeds species are sparsely distributed in space and time with few observations recorded in high foliage cover categories. A separable model for space-time dependence that maintains parameter interpretability in the presence of aggregated ordinal categories is therefore developed. Estimation and prediction is demonstrated using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) methods developed for univariate spatio-temporal models. Bayesian estimation and prediction shows that the four invasive weed species differentially respond to habitat type, control effort and accessibility, and share similar magnitudes of dependence with short effective spatial ranges and strong temporal autocorrelations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transforming Norm-based To Graph-based Spatial Representation for Spatio-Temporal Epidemiological Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14539v3)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pandemics, with their profound societal and economic impacts, pose significant threats to global health, mortality rates, economic stability, and political landscapes. In response to these challenges, numerous studies have employed spatio-temporal models to enhance our understanding and management of these complex phenomena. These spatio-temporal models can be roughly divided into two main spatial categories: norm-based and graph-based. Norm-based models are usually more accurate and easier to model but are more computationally intensive and require more data to fit. On the other hand, graph-based models are less accurate and harder to model but are less computationally intensive and require fewer data to fit. As such, ideally, one would like to use a graph-based model while preserving the representation accuracy obtained by the norm-based model. In this study, we explore the ability to transform from norm-based to graph-based spatial representation for these models. We first show no analytical mapping between the two exists, requiring one to use approximation numerical methods instead. We introduce a novel framework for this task together with twelve possible implementations using a wide range of heuristic optimization approaches. Our findings show that by leveraging agent-based simulations and heuristic algorithms for the graph node's location and population's spatial walk dynamics approximation one can use graph-based spatial representation without losing much of the model's accuracy and expressiveness. We investigate our framework for three real-world cases, achieving 94\% accuracy preservation, on average. Moreover, an analysis of synthetic cases shows the proposed framework is relatively robust for changes in both spatial and temporal properties.</p></details> |  |

While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model. Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic, implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate 1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Flow Matching for Learning Spatio-Temporal Trajectories in 4D Longitudinal Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21580v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions. While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e. predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports $3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.</p></details> |  |

To fully leverage this information, however, the extracted features must be organized in a structured and meaningful way that supports efficient access and use. One promising approach is question answering (QA), which allows users -- especially those unfamiliar with database query languages -- to retrieve knowledge in a natural and intuitive manner. In this project, we developed a GeoQA system by integrating a spatio-temporal knowledge graph (KG) constructed from historical map data with large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we have defined the ontology to guide the construction of the spatio-temporal KG and investigated workflows of two different types of GeoQA: factual and descriptive. Additional data sources, such as historical map images and internet search results, are incorporated into our framework to provide extra context for descriptive GeoQA. Evaluation results demonstrate that the system can generate answers with a high delivery rate and a high semantic accuracy. To make the framework accessible, we further developed a web application that supports interactive querying and visualization.</p></details> |  |

They pose, however, significant computational challenges in high-dimensional settings, which frequently arise in spatial-temporal applications. We present DALIA, a highly scalable framework for performing Bayesian inference tasks on spatio-temporal multivariate GPs, based on the methodology of integrated nested Laplace approximations. Our approach relies on a sparse inverse covariance matrix formulation of the GP, puts forward a GPU-accelerated block-dense approach, and introduces a hierarchical, triple-layer, distributed memory parallel scheme. We showcase weak scaling performance surpassing the state-of-the-art by two orders of magnitude on a model whose parameter space is 8$\times$ larger and measure strong scaling speedups of three orders of magnitude when running on 496 GH200 superchips on the Alps supercomputer. Applying DALIA to air pollution data from northern Italy over 48 days, we showcase refined spatial resolutions over the aggregated pollutant measurements.</p></details> |  |

Privacy statutes such as the GDPR require that any individual's contribution be unlearned on demand, yet retraining deep models from scratch for every request is untenable. We introduce MobText-SISA, a scalable machine-unlearning framework that extends Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and Aggregated (SISA) training to heterogeneous spatio-temporal data. MobText-SISA first embeds each trip's numerical and linguistic features into a shared latent space, then employs similarity-aware clustering to distribute samples across shards so that future deletions touch only a single constituent model while preserving inter-shard diversity. Each shard is trained incrementally; at inference time, constituent predictions are aggregated to yield the output. Deletion requests trigger retraining solely of the affected shard from its last valid checkpoint, guaranteeing exact unlearning. Experiments on a ten-month real-world mobility log demonstrate that MobText-SISA (i) sustains baseline predictive accuracy, and (ii) consistently outperforms random sharding in both error and convergence speed. These results establish MobText-SISA as a practical foundation for privacy-compliant analytics on multimodal mobility data at urban scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The 33rd ACM International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems(SIGSPATIAL '25) as a short paper in the Short Paper Track</p></details> |

It aims to provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network (\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception. The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details, while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Pruning for Compressed Spiking Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20122v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant challenges for deployment in energy-constrained environments due to their large model sizes and high inference latency. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the sparse event-driven neural processing and energy-efficient information transmission in the brain, offer a promising alternative for achieving low-power computing. Integrating the event-driven efficiency of spiking neurons with the advanced capabilities of LLMs represents a promising direction for power-efficient LLMs. This work specifically delves into the design of compressed spiking LLMs. Here, we revisit spatial and temporal pruning from the perspective of SNNs and propose a novel spatio-temporal pruning framework for Spiking LLMs to optimize computational efficiency while preserving high performance. Our spatial pruning technique reduces the number of active neurons and attention heads, effectively lowering the computational complexity of the model. Meanwhile, temporal pruning minimizes inference latency by dynamically adjusting the number of timesteps required for different layers. By combining these approaches with other compression techniques, we present the first work in the domain of Spiking LLMs to jointly explore spatial pruning, temporal pruning, extreme quantization and knowledge distillation strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation of our proposed framework for SpikingBERT on the large-scale GLUE benchmark demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in terms of computational operations and inference latency. Our approach offers a compelling solution for real-time, low-power natural language processing applications, making Spiking LLMs more practical for deployment on edge devices and in power-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |

The approach enables nonparametric and data driven estimation of complex time evolving vector fields while preserving both spatial and temporal structure. We establish representer theorems for time dependent OV-RKHS interpolation, derive Sobolev type approximation bounds for smooth vector fields, and provide spectral convergence guarantees for kernel Koopman operator approximations. This framework supports efficient reduced order modeling and long term prediction of high dimensional nonlinear systems, offering theoretically grounded tools for forecasting, control, and uncertainty quantification in spatio-temporal machine learning.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Annua...</summary><p>Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 2025</p></details> |

In particular, for Hidden Markov Models, the whole state space has to be enumerated for advancing in time. Even states with negligible probabilities are considered, resulting in computational inefficiency and increased noise due to the propagation of unlikely probability mass. We propose to denoise the future and speed up inference by using only the top-p states, i.e., the most probable states with accumulated probability p. We show that the error introduced by using only the top-p states is bound by p and the so-called minimal mixing rate of the underlying model. Moreover, in our empirical evaluation, we show that we can expect speedups of at least an order of magnitude, while the error in terms of total variation distance is below 0.09.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECSQARU 2025</p></details> |

In parallel, Flow Matching (FM) has gained traction in language, vision, and scientific domains, but inference-time scaling methods for it remain under-explored. Concurrently, Kim et al., 2025 approach this problem but replace the linear interpolant with a non-linear variance-preserving (VP) interpolant at inference, sacrificing FM's efficient and straight sampling. Additionally, inference-time compute scaling for flow matching has only been applied to visual tasks, like image generation. We introduce novel inference-time scaling procedures for FM that preserve the linear interpolant during sampling. Evaluations of our method on image generation, and for the first time (to the best of our knowledge), unconditional protein generation, show that I) sample quality consistently improves as inference compute increases, and II) flow matching inference-time scaling can be applied to scientific domains.</p></details> |  |

We show that speech foundation models learn representations that generalize beyond the speech domain and achieve state-of-the-art performance on diverse time-series tasks from wearable sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0 outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on modality-specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and activity classification tasks. We find that the convolutional feature encoders of speech models are particularly relevant for wearable sensor applications. The proposed approach enhances performance on data-scarce time-series tasks using simple probing methods. This work takes a step toward developing generalized time-series models that unify speech and sensor modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |
| **[Generalized Flow in Nearly-linear Time on Moderately Dense Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17740v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we consider generalized flow problems where there is an $m$-edge $n$-node directed graph $G = (V,E)$ and each edge $e \in E$ has a loss factor $\gamma_e >0$ governing whether the flow is increased or decreased as it crosses edge $e$. We provide a randomized $\tilde{O}( (m + n^{1.5}) \cdot \mathrm{polylog}(\frac{W}{\delta}))$ time algorithm for solving the generalized maximum flow and generalized minimum cost flow problems in this setting where $\delta$ is the target accuracy and $W$ is the maximum of all costs, capacities, and loss factors and their inverses. This improves upon the previous state-of-the-art $\tilde{O}(m \sqrt{n} \cdot \log^2(\frac{W}{\delta}) )$ time algorithm, obtained by combining the algorithm of [Daitch-Spielman, 2008] with techniques from [Lee-Sidford, 2014]. To obtain this result we provide new dynamic data structures and spectral results regarding the matrices associated to generalized flows and apply them through the interior point method framework of [Brand-Lee-Liu-Saranurak-Sidford-Song-Wang, 2021].</p></details> | 65 pages.

| **[Time-Varying Bayesian Optimization Without a Metronome](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18963v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-Varying Bayesian Optimization (TVBO) is the go-to framework for optimizing a time-varying, expensive, noisy black-box function $f$. However, most of the asymptotic guarantees offered by TVBO algorithms rely on the assumption that observations are acquired at a constant frequency. As the GP inference complexity scales with the cube of its dataset size, this assumption is unrealistic in the long run. In this paper, we relax this assumption and derive the first upper regret bound that explicitly accounts for changes in the observations sampling frequency. Based on this analysis, we formulate practical recommendations about dataset sizes and stale data policies of TVBO algorithms. We illustrate how an algorithm (BOLT) that follows these recommendations performs better than the state-of-the-art of TVBO through experiments on synthetic and real-world problems.</p></details> |  |

Is it possible for the instantaneous regret of a TVBO algorithm to vanish asymptotically, and if so, when? We answer this question of great importance by providing upper bounds and algorithm-independent lower bounds for the cumulative regret of TVBO algorithms. In doing so, we provide important insights about the TVBO framework and derive sufficient conditions for a TVBO algorithm to have the no-regret property. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis is the first to cover all major classes of stationary kernel functions used in practice.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Car Models in Time (CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models, a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023), supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging, evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies: time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs. CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained visual recognition and generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in NeurIPS 2025 Track on Datasets and Benchmarks</p></details> |

This design enables full diversity gain in the common stream transmission for all users, regardless of the uncertainty of the channel state information (CSI) and network load conditions, thereby overcoming the performance limitations of conventional RSMA that employs a single beamforming vector for all users. To further enhance performance, we develop a weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE)-based algorithm tailored to ST-RSMA that jointly optimizes the power allocation for the common stream and the power/beamforming vectors for private streams, aiming to maximize the minimum user rate. Numerical results show that ST-RSMA significantly outperforms conventional RSMA and other multiple access techniques, offering a robust and scalable solution for LEO SATCOM.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology</p></details> |
| **[TimeEmb: A Lightweight Static-Dynamic Disentanglement Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00461v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at https://github.com/showmeon/TimeEmb.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Training for Speech Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01847v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel application of Test-Time Training (TTT) for Speech Enhancement, addressing the challenges posed by unpredictable noise conditions and domain shifts. This method combines a main speech enhancement task with a self-supervised auxiliary task in a Y-shaped architecture. The model dynamically adapts to new domains during inference time by optimizing the proposed self-supervised tasks like noise-augmented signal reconstruction or masked spectrogram prediction, bypassing the need for labeled data. We further introduce various TTT strategies offering a trade-off between adaptation and efficiency. Evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets show consistent improvements across speech quality metrics, outperforming the baseline model. This work highlights the effectiveness of TTT in speech enhancement, providing insights for future research in adaptive and robust speech processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of Interspeech 2025</p></details> |
| **[Formally Exploring Time-Series Anomaly Detection Evaluation Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17562v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Undetected anomalies in time series can trigger catastrophic failures in safety-critical systems, such as chemical plant explosions or power grid outages. Although many detection methods have been proposed, their performance remains unclear because current metrics capture only narrow aspects of the task and often yield misleading results. We address this issue by introducing verifiable properties that formalize essential requirements for evaluating time-series anomaly detection. These properties enable a theoretical framework that supports principled evaluations and reliable comparisons. Analyzing 37 widely used metrics, we show that most satisfy only a few properties, and none satisfy all, explaining persistent inconsistencies in prior results. To close this gap, we propose LARM, a flexible metric that provably satisfies all properties, and extend it to ALARM, an advanced variant meeting stricter requirements.</p></details> | 73 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Certified Self-Consistency: Statistical Guarantees and Test-Time Training for Reliable Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17472v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances such as self-consistency and test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) improve the reliability of large language models (LLMs) without additional supervision, yet their underlying mechanisms and statistical guarantees remain poorly understood. We present a unified framework for certifiable inference in LLMs, showing that majority voting provides a statistical certificate of self-consistency: under mild assumptions, the aggregated answer coincides with the mode of the model's terminal distribution with high probability. We derive finite-sample and anytime-valid concentration bounds that quantify this confidence, and introduce the Martingale Majority Certificate (MMC), a sequential stopping rule that adaptively determines when sufficient samples have been drawn. We further prove that label-free post-training methods such as TTRL implicitly sharpen the answer distribution by exponentially tilting it toward its mode, thereby reducing the number of samples required for certification. Building on this insight, we propose new post-training objectives that explicitly optimise this trade-off between sharpness and bias. Together, these results explain and connect two central test-time scaling strategies, self-consistency and TTRL, within a single statistical framework for label-free, certifiable reliability in reasoning LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution wind data remains challenging due to limitations in traditional in-situ observations and remote sensing techniques, as well as the computational expense and biases of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This paper introduces G-WindCast, a novel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to forecast three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric wind fields. The framework utilizes Forward Neural Networks (FNN) and Transformer networks to capture complex, nonlinear, and spatiotemporal relationships between GNSS-derived features and wind dynamics. Our preliminary results demonstrate promising accuracy in real-time wind forecasts (up to 30 minutes lead time). The model exhibits robustness across forecast horizons and different pressure levels, and its predictions for wind fields show superior agreement with ground-based radar wind profiler compared to concurrent European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5). Furthermore, we show that the system can maintain excellent performance for localized forecasting even with a significantly reduced number of GNSS stations (e.g., around 100), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and scalability. This interdisciplinary approach underscores the transformative potential of exploiting non-traditional data sources and deep learning for advanced environmental monitoring and real-time atmospheric applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 10 figures; Minor text revisions; Updated the questions, some images in the article, the abstract, and the main text content</p></details> |

To address these issues, inverse problems focus on reconstructing the original signal from corrupted data by leveraging prior knowledge about its underlying structure. While deep learning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require extensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In this work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series Linear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high recovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages neural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization techniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on Gaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and robustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization, input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques. Each of these contributions strengthens the framework's optimization stability and robustness. These advancements make RINS-T a flexible and effective solution for addressing complex real-world time series challenges. Our code is available at https://github.com/EPFL-IMOS/RINS-T.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement</p></details> |

In this work, we establish the first sample complexity results for average-reward offline RL with function approximation for weakly communicating MDPs, a much milder assumption. To this end, we introduce Anchored Fitted Q-Iteration, which combines the standard Fitted Q-Iteration with an anchor mechanism. We show that the anchor, which can be interpreted as a form of weight decay, is crucial for enabling finite-time analysis in the average-reward setting. We also extend our finite-time analysis to the setup where the dataset is generated from a single-trajectory rather than IID transitions, again leveraging the anchor mechanism.</p></details> |  |

Two classes of the ERKC methods are constructed and their convergence properties are analyzed. It is shown that methods with $s$ arbitrary nonconfluent collocation parameters achieve convergence of order $s$. Provided that the collocation parameters fulfill some additional conditions and the solutions of the problems exhibit sufficient temporal and spatial smoothness, we derive superconvergence results. Finally, some numerical experiments are presented to illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Every Rollout Counts: Optimal Resource Allocation for Efficient Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15707v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using additional inference-time computation to explore multiple reasoning paths through search. Yet how to allocate a fixed rollout budget most effectively during search remains underexplored, often resulting in inefficient use of compute at test time. To bridge this gap, we formulate test-time search as a resource allocation problem and derive the optimal allocation strategy that maximizes the probability of obtaining a correct solution under a fixed rollout budget. Within this formulation, we reveal a core limitation of existing search methods: solution-level allocation tends to favor reasoning directions with more candidates, leading to theoretically suboptimal and inefficient use of compute. To address this, we propose Direction-Oriented Resource Allocation (DORA), a provably optimal method that mitigates this bias by decoupling direction quality from candidate count and allocating resources at the direction level. To demonstrate DORA's effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks including MATH500, AIME2024, and AIME2025. The empirical results show that DORA consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. We hope our findings contribute to a broader understanding of optimal TTS for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS2025</p></details> |

This survey offers a structured overview of explainable deep clustering for time series, collecting current methods and their real-world applications. We thoroughly discuss and compare peer-reviewed and preprint papers through application domains across healthcare, finance, IoT, and climate science. Our analysis reveals that most work relies on autoencoder and attention architectures, with limited support for streaming, irregularly sampled, or privacy-preserved series, and interpretability is still primarily treated as an add-on. To push the field forward, we outline six research opportunities: (1) combining complex networks with built-in interpretability; (2) setting up clear, faithfulness-focused evaluation metrics for unsupervised explanations; (3) building explainers that adapt to live data streams; (4) crafting explanations tailored to specific domains; (5) adding human-in-the-loop methods that refine clusters and explanations together; and (6) improving our understanding of how time series clustering models work internally. By making interpretability a primary design goal rather than an afterthought, we propose the groundwork for the next generation of trustworthy deep clustering time series analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted at TempXAI Workshop at ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |

SymTime demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP, still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification, we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of PatchMoE.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose FlowDet, a high-speed detector featuring a decoupled encoder optimization strategy applied to the DETR architecture. Specifically, FlowDet employs a novel Geometric Deformable Unit (GDU) for traffic-aware geometric modeling and a Scale-Aware Attention (SAA) module to maintain high representational power across extreme scale variations. To rigorously evaluate the model's performance in environments with severe occlusion and high object density, we collected the Intersection-Flow-5k dataset, a new challenging scene for this task. Evaluated on Intersection-Flow-5k, FlowDet establishes a new state-of-the-art. Compared to the strong RT-DETR baseline, it improves AP(test) by 1.5% and AP50(test) by 1.6%, while simultaneously reducing GFLOPs by 63.2% and increasing inference speed by 16.2%.

Recent works focus on building unimodal time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models. Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts, the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization, encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both unimodal and multimodal scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Time Series Forecasting through Selective Representation Spaces: A Patch Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14510v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space (SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains.

| **[Solving the Correlation Cluster LP in Sublinear Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20883v4)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Correlation Clustering is a fundamental and widely-studied problem in unsupervised learning and data mining. The input is a graph and the goal is to construct a clustering minimizing the number of inter-cluster edges plus the number of missing intra-cluster edges. CCL+24 introduced the cluster LP for Correlation Clustering, which they argued captures the problem much more succinctly than previous linear programming formulations. However, the cluster LP has exponential size, with a variable for every possible set of vertices in the input graph. Nevertheless, CCL+24 showed how to find a feasible solution for the cluster LP in time $O(n^{\text{poly}(1/\eps)})$ with objective value at most $(1+\epsilon)$ times the value of an optimal solution for the respective Correlation Clustering instance. Furthermore, they showed how to round a solution to the cluster LP, yielding a $(1.485+\eps)$-approximation algorithm for the Correlation Clustering problem. The main technical result of this paper is a new approach to find a feasible solution for the cluster LP with objective value at most $(1+\epsilon)$ of the optimum in time $\widetilde O(2^{\text{poly}(1/\eps)} n)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph. We also show how to implement the rounding within the same time bounds, thus achieving a fast $(1.485+\eps)$-approximation algorithm for the Correlation Clustering problem. This bridges the gap between state-of-the-art methods for approximating Correlation Clustering and the recent focus on fast algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Q-Score Matching: Diffusion Guided Reinforcement Learning for Continuous-Time Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17122v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant success across a wide range of domains, however, most existing methods are formulated in discrete time. In this work, we introduce a novel RL method for continuous-time control, where stochastic differential equations govern state-action dynamics. Departing from traditional value function-based approaches, our key contribution is the characterization of continuous-time Q-functions via a martingale condition and the linking of diffusion policy scores to the action gradient of a learned continuous Q-function by the dynamic programming principle. This insight motivates Continuous Q-Score Matching (CQSM), a score-based policy improvement algorithm. Notably, our method addresses a long-standing challenge in continuous-time RL: preserving the action-evaluation capability of Q-functions without relying on time discretization. We further provide theoretical closed-form solutions for linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems within our framework. Numerical results in simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and compare it to popular baselines.</p></details> |  |

This work demystifies the Transformer encoder by establishing its fundamental equivalence to a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). We show that in the forward pass, the attention distribution matrix serves as a dynamic adjacency matrix, and its composition with subsequent transformations performs computations analogous to graph convolution. Moreover, we demonstrate that in the backward pass, the update dynamics of value and feed-forward projections mirror those of GCN parameters. Building on this unified theoretical reinterpretation, we propose \textbf{Fighter} (Flexible Graph Convolutional Transformer), a streamlined architecture that removes redundant linear projections and incorporates multi-hop graph aggregation. This perspective yields an explicit and interpretable representation of temporal dependencies across different scales, naturally expressed as graph edges. Experiments on standard forecasting benchmarks confirm that Fighter achieves competitive performance while providing clearer mechanistic interpretability of its predictions.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Attention (as Discrete-Time Markov) Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17657v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new interpretation of the attention matrix as a discrete-time Markov chain. Our interpretation sheds light on common operations involving attention scores such as selection, summation, and averaging in a unified framework. It further extends them by considering indirect attention, propagated through the Markov chain, as opposed to previous studies that only model immediate effects. Our key observation is that tokens linked to semantically similar regions form metastable states, i.e., regions where attention tends to concentrate, while noisy attention scores dissipate. Metastable states and their prevalence can be easily computed through simple matrix multiplication and eigenanalysis, respectively. Using these lightweight tools, we demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation. Lastly, we define TokenRank -- the steady state vector of the Markov chain, which measures global token importance. We show that TokenRank enhances unconditional image generation, improving both quality (IS) and diversity (FID), and can also be incorporated into existing segmentation techniques to improve their performance over existing benchmarks. We believe our framework offers a fresh view of how tokens are being attended in modern visual transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Traffic Prioritization Mechanisms for Mission and Time Critical Applications in Industrial Internet of Things](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17009v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) promises to revolutionize industrial operations and productions through utilizing Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. Since each node in such environments generates various types of data with diverse service requirements, MAC protocol holds crucial importance to ensure efficient delivery. In this context, simple to complex MAC schemes are found in literature. This paper focuses on evaluating the performance of two major techniques "slot stealing" and "packet fragmentation" for the IIoT; representative protocols SS-MAC and FROG-MAC have been chosen from each category respectively. We conducted realistic simulations for the two protocols using Contiki. Delay and packet loss comparison for SS-MAC and FROG-MAC indicates the superiority of FROG-MAC due to reduction in the waiting time for urgent traffic. Thus, a simple fragmentation scheme could be deployed for efficient scheduling of heterogenous traffic in the industrial environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smart Traffic Signals: Comparing MARL and Fixed-Time Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14544v3)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban traffic congestion, particularly at intersections, significantly impacts travel time, fuel consumption, and emissions. Traditional fixed-time signal control systems often lack the adaptability to manage dynamic traffic patterns effectively. This study explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across multiple intersections within a simulated environment. Utilizing Pygame, a simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability. A decentralized MARL controller was implemented, in which each traffic signal operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies hold substantial promise for improving urban traffic management efficiency. More research is recommended to address scalability and real-world implementation challenges.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a BlueSky vision built on two complementary directions. One builds robust foundations for time series reasoning, centered on comprehensive temporal understanding, structured multi-step reasoning, and faithful evaluation frameworks. The other advances system-level reasoning, moving beyond language-only explanations by incorporating multi-agent collaboration, multi-modal context, and retrieval-augmented approaches. Together, these directions outline a flexible and extensible framework for advancing time series reasoning, aiming to deliver interpretable and trustworthy temporal intelligence across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking Off-the-Grid Sparse Recovery with Unlimited Sensing: Simultaneous Super-Resolution in Time and Amplitude](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16948v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recovery of Dirac impulses, or spikes, from filtered measurements is a classical problem in signal processing. As the spikes lie in the continuous domain while measurements are discrete, this task is known as super-resolution or off-the-grid sparse recovery. Despite significant theoretical and algorithmic advances over the past decade, these developments often overlook critical challenges at the analog-digital interface. In particular, when spikes exhibit strong-weak amplitude disparity, conventional digital acquisition may result in clipping of strong components or loss of weak ones beneath the quantization noise floor. This motivates a broader perspective: super-resolution must simultaneously resolve both amplitude and temporal structure. Under a fixed bit budget, such information loss is unavoidable. In contrast, the emerging theory and practice of the Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF) demonstrate that these fundamental limitations can be overcome. Building on this foundation, we demonstrate that modulo encoding within USF enables digital super-resolution by enhancing measurement precision, thereby unlocking temporal super-resolution beyond conventional limits. We develop new theoretical results that extend to non-bandlimited kernels commonly encountered in practice and introduce a robust algorithm for off-the-grid sparse recovery. To demonstrate practical impact, we instantiate our framework in the context of time-of-flight imaging. Both numerical simulations and hardware experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach under low-bit quantization, enabling super-resolution in amplitude and time.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 Pa...</summary><p>28 Pages, 10 figures.

By replacing scalar weights with spline-based functional connections and directly parameterizing predictive distributions, P-KANs offer expressive yet parameter-efficient models capable of capturing nonlinear and heavy-tailed dynamics. We evaluate P-KANs on satellite traffic forecasting, where uncertainty-aware predictions enable dynamic thresholding for resource allocation. Results show that P-KANs consistently outperform Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) baselines in both accuracy and calibration, achieving superior efficiency-risk trade-offs while using significantly fewer parameters. We build up P-KANs on two distributions, namely Gaussian and Student-t distributions. The Gaussian variant provides robust, conservative forecasts suitable for safety-critical scenarios, whereas the Student-t variant yields sharper distributions that improve efficiency under stable demand. These findings establish P-KANs as a powerful framework for probabilistic forecasting with direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Test Time Adaptation with Few-shot Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01341v3)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks often encounter significant performance drops while facing with domain shifts between training (source) and test (target) data. To address this issue, Test Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed to adapt pre-trained source model to handle out-of-distribution streaming target data. Although these methods offer some relief, they lack a reliable mechanism for domain shift correction, which can often be erratic in real-world applications. In response, we develop Few-Shot Test Time Adaptation (FS-TTA), a novel and practical setting that utilizes a few-shot support set on top of TTA. Adhering to the principle of few inputs, big gains, FS-TTA reduces blind exploration in unseen target domains. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage framework to tackle FS-TTA, including (i) fine-tuning the pre-trained source model with few-shot support set, along with using feature diversity augmentation module to avoid overfitting, (ii) implementing test time adaptation based on prototype memory bank guidance to produce high quality pseudo-label for model adaptation. Through extensive experiments on three cross-domain classification benchmarks, we demonstrate the superior performance and reliability of our FS-TTA and framework.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing methods either rely on prompt engineering, which leads to poor generalization across problem types, or require costly supervised training. We introduce SolverLLM, a training-free framework that leverages test-time scaling to solve diverse optimization problems. Rather than solving directly, SolverLLM generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code, guided by a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy. To enhance the search process, we modify classical MCTS with (1) dynamic expansion for adaptive formulation generation, (2) prompt backpropagation to guide exploration via outcome-driven feedback, and (3) uncertainty backpropagation to incorporate reward reliability into decision-making. Experiments on six standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that SolverLLM outperforms both prompt-based and learning-based baselines, achieving strong generalization without additional training.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, directly leveraging pretrained features for downstream tasks often suffers from multicollinearity in the similarity-matching stage, and more advanced methods can be computationally prohibitive for real-time, low-latency applications. Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose Fly-CL, a bio-inspired framework compatible with a wide range of pretrained backbones. Fly-CL substantially reduces training time while achieving performance comparable to or exceeding that of current state-of-the-art methods. We theoretically show how Fly-CL progressively resolves multicollinearity, enabling more effective similarity matching with low time complexity. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse network architectures and data regimes validate Fly-CL's effectiveness in addressing this challenge through a biologically inspired design.

| **[MMformer with Adaptive Transferable Attention: Advancing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting for Environmental Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14050v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environmental crisis remains a global challenge that affects public health and environmental quality. Despite extensive research, accurately forecasting environmental change trends to inform targeted policies and assess prediction efficiency remains elusive. Conventional methods for multivariate time series (MTS) analysis often fail to capture the complex dynamics of environmental change. To address this, we introduce an innovative meta-learning MTS model, MMformer with Adaptive Transferable Multi-head Attention (ATMA), which combines self-attention and meta-learning for enhanced MTS forecasting. Specifically, MMformer is used to model and predict the time series of seven air quality indicators across 331 cities in China from January 2018 to June 2021 and the time series of precipitation and temperature at 2415 monitoring sites during the summer (276 days) from 2012 to 2014, validating the network's ability to perform and forecast MTS data successfully. Experimental results demonstrate that in these datasets, the MMformer model reaching SOTA outperforms iTransformer, Transformer, and the widely used traditional time series prediction algorithm SARIMAX in the prediction of MTS, reducing by 50\% in MSE, 20\% in MAE as compared to others in air quality datasets, reducing by 20\% in MAPE except SARIMAX. Compared with Transformer and SARIMAX in the climate datasets, MSE, MAE, and MAPE are decreased by 30\%, and there is an improvement compared to iTransformer. This approach represents a significant advance in our ability to forecast and respond to dynamic environmental quality challenges in diverse urban and rural environments. Its predictive capabilities provide valuable public health and environmental quality information, informing targeted interventions.</p></details> |  |

We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST; with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient long-term time-series prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 tables, 3 figures, accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |

Traditional weapon detection approaches rely on object detection frameworks that provide only coarse bounding box localizations, lacking the fine-grained segmentation required for comprehensive threat analysis. Furthermore, existing semantic segmentation models either sacrifice accuracy for computational efficiency or require excessive computational resources incompatible with edge deployment scenarios. This paper presents ArmFormer, a lightweight transformer-based semantic segmentation framework that strategically integrates Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) with MixVisionTransformer architecture to achieve superior accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. Our approach combines CBAM-enhanced encoder backbone with attention-integrated hamburger decoder to enable multi-class weapon segmentation across five categories: handgun, rifle, knife, revolver, and human. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArmFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance with 80.64% mIoU and 89.13% mFscore while maintaining real-time inference at 82.26 FPS. With only 4.886G FLOPs and 3.66M parameters, ArmFormer outperforms heavyweight models requiring up to 48x more computation, establishing it as the optimal solution for deployment on portable security cameras, surveillance drones, and embedded AI accelerators in distributed security infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages with 4 figures and 5 tables.

This gives rise to a family of causal estimands indexed by a scalar parameter {\alpha}, which changes the event rate while preserving the temporal and covariate structure of the data-generating process. We introduce calibrated interventions, where \(\alpha\) is chosen to achieve a pre-specified goal, such as a desired level of cumulative risk of the intermediate event, and define corresponding composite target parameters capturing the resulting effects on the outcome process. Our proposal enables practical yet statistically principled intervention analysis in survival and longitudinal settings, which offers a flexible alternative to deterministic or static interventions that are often ill-defined. The framework applies broadly to causal questions involving time-to-event treatments or mediators, and offers a pragmatic analogue to indirect/direct effect decompositions. We present the efficient influence curves for various versions of target parameters under a nonparametric statistical model, discuss their double robustness properties, and propose an estimation procedure based on targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE). The proposed estimands are illustrated through examples of event-history scenarios addressing distinct causal questions.</p></details> |  |

Recent attempts to apply search strategies to continuous diffusion models show limited benefits, with simple random sampling often performing best. We demonstrate that the discrete, sequential nature of visual autoregressive models enables effective search for image generation. We show that beam search substantially improves text-to-image generation, enabling a 2B parameter autoregressive model to outperform a 12B parameter diffusion model across benchmarks. Systematic ablations show that this advantage comes from the discrete token space, which allows early pruning and computational reuse, and our verifier analysis highlights trade-offs between speed and reasoning capability. These findings suggest that model architecture, not just scale, is critical for inference-time optimization in visual generation.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Multivariate Time Series (MTS) analysis has become an important yet challenging task, attracting significant attention. While channel extremely matters to MTS tasks, channel-centric methods are still largely under-explored for MTS. Particularly, no previous work studied the effects of channel information of MTS in order to explore counterfactual effects between these channels and model performance. To fill this gap, we propose a novel Channel-wise Influence (ChInf) method that is the first to estimate the influence of different channels in MTS. Based on ChInf,we naturally derived two channel-wise algorithms by incorporating ChInf into classic MTS tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ChInf and ChInf-based methods in critical MTS analysis tasks, such as MTS anomaly detection and MTS data pruning. Specifically, our ChInf-based methods rank top-1 among all methods for comparison, while previous influence functions do not perform well on MTS anomaly detection tasks and MTS data pruning problem. This fully supports the superiority and necessity of ChInf.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurips 2025</p></details> |

Existing RAG methods are largely semantic and typically neglect explicit temporal constraints, which leads to time-inconsistent answers and inflated token usage. We propose STAR-RAG, a temporal GraphRAG framework that relies on two key ideas: building a time-aligned rule graph and conducting propagation on this graph to narrow the search space and prioritize semantically relevant, time-consistent evidence. This design enforces temporal proximity during retrieval, reduces the candidate set of retrieval results, and lowers token consumption without sacrificing accuracy. Compared with existing temporal RAG approaches, STAR-RAG eliminates the need for heavy model training and fine-tuning, thereby reducing computational cost and significantly simplifying deployment.Extensive experiments on real-world temporal KG datasets show that our method achieves improved answer accuracy while consuming fewer tokens than strong GraphRAG baselines.</p></details> |  |

The primary goal is to optimize motion execution time by leveraging the redundancy of both arms, specifically in tasks where only the relative pose of the robots is constrained, such as dual-arm scanning of unknown objects. Unlike traditional inverse kinematics methods that use surrogate metrics such as joint configuration distance, our method incorporates direct motion execution time and implicit collisions into the optimization process, thereby finding target joints that allow subsequent trajectory generation to get more efficient and collision-free motion. A neural network based execution time approximator is employed to predict time-efficient joint configurations while accounting for potential collisions. Through experimental evaluation on a system composed of a UR5 and a KUKA iiwa robot, we demonstrate significant reductions in execution time. The proposed method outperforms conventional approaches, showing improved motion efficiency without sacrificing positioning accuracy. These results highlight the potential of ETA-IK to improve the performance of dual-arm systems in applications, where efficiency and safety are paramount.</p></details> |  |

Two tasks are studied under record-level, non-overlapping splits: near-term tachycardia risk (next ten seconds) and one-step heart rate forecasting. We compare a GRU-D (RNN) and a Transformer under matched training budgets against strong non-learned baselines. Evaluation is calibration-aware for classification and proper for forecasting, with temperature scaling and grouped bootstrap confidence intervals. On MIT-BIH, GRU-D slightly surpasses the Transformer for tachycardia risk, while the Transformer clearly lowers forecasting error relative to GRU-D and persistence. Our results show that, in longitudinal monitoring, model choice is task-dependent: compact RNNs remain competitive for short-horizon risk scoring, whereas compact Transformers deliver clearer gains for point forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, while labeled anomalies are often scarce in emerging applications, existing supervised GAD approaches are either ineffective or not applicable when moved across graph domains due to distribution shifts and heterogeneous feature spaces. To address these challenges, we present GADT3, a novel test-time training framework for cross-domain GAD. GADT3 combines supervised and self-supervised learning during training while adapting to a new domain during test time using only self-supervised learning by leveraging a homophily-based affinity score that captures domain-invariant properties of anomalies. Our framework introduces four key innovations to cross-domain GAD: an effective self-supervision scheme, an attention-based mechanism that dynamically learns edge importance weights during message passing, domain-specific encoders for handling heterogeneous features, and class-aware regularization to address imbalance. Experiments across multiple cross-domain settings demonstrate that GADT3 significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving average improvements of over 8.2\% in AUROC and AUPRC compared to the best competing model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2025</p></details> |

Traditional image processing techniques often lack the precision, robustness, and speed required for real-time clinical use. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a deep learning framework for real-time medical image analysis designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple imaging modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. The proposed system integrates advanced neural network architectures such as U-Net, EfficientNet, and Transformer-based models with real-time optimization strategies including model pruning, quantization, and GPU acceleration. The framework enables flexible deployment on edge devices, local servers, and cloud infrastructures, ensuring seamless interoperability with clinical systems such as PACS and EHR. Experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving classification accuracies above 92%, segmentation Dice scores exceeding 91%, and inference times below 80 milliseconds. Furthermore, visual explanation tools such as Grad-CAM and segmentation overlays enhance transparency and clinical interpretability. These results indicate that the proposed framework can substantially accelerate diagnostic workflows, reduce clinician workload, and support trustworthy AI integration in time-critical healthcare environments.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Prior Makes It Possible: From Sublinear Graph Algorithms to LLM Test-Time Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16609v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time augmentation, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or tool use, critically depends on an interplay between a model's parametric knowledge and externally retrieved information. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this relationship remain poorly understood. Specifically, it is not clear how much pre-training knowledge is required to answer queries with a small number of augmentation steps, which is a desirable property in practice. To address this question, we formulate multi-step reasoning as an $s$-$t$ connectivity problem on a knowledge graph. We represent a model's pre-training parametric knowledge as a partial, potentially noisy subgraph. We view augmentation as querying an oracle for true edges that augment the model's knowledge. Then, we characterize the necessary and sufficient number of augmentation steps for the model to generate an accurate answer given partial prior knowledge. One key result shows a phase transition: if the prior knowledge graph over $n$ vertices is disconnected into small components, then finding a path via augmentation is inefficient and requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ queries. On the other hand, once the density of correct knowledge surpasses a threshold, forming a giant component, we can find paths with an expected constant number of queries.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings -- extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline -- serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI AI for Social Impact 2026.

| **[Multiply Robust Estimation of Conditional Survival Probability with Time-Varying Covariates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10372v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is often of interest to study the association between covariates and the cumulative incidence of a time-to-event outcome, but a common challenge is right-censoring. When time-varying covariates are measured on a fixed discrete time scale, it is desirable to account for these more up-to-date covariates when addressing censoring. For example, in vaccine trials, it is of interest to study the association between immune response levels after administering the vaccine and the cumulative incidence of the endpoint, while accounting for loss to follow-up explained by immune response levels measured at multiple post-vaccination visits. Existing methods rely on stringent parametric assumptions, do not account for informative censoring due to time-varying covariates when time is continuous, only estimate a marginal survival probability, or do not fully use the discrete-time structure of post-treatment covariates. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric estimator of the continuous-time survival probability conditional on covariates, accounting for censoring due to time-varying covariates measured on a fixed discrete time scale. We show that the estimator is multiply robust: it is consistent if, within each time window between adjacent visits, at least one of the time-to-event distribution and the censoring distribution is consistently estimated. We demonstrate the superior performance of this estimator in a numerical simulation, and apply the method to a COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trial.</p></details> | <details><summary>clari...</summary><p>clarified estimand and its scientific relevance; fixed reference in supplement</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal traversability assessment method, which aims to enable autonomous robots to effectively navigate through complex terrains. Our approach utilizes sparse Gaussian processes (SGP) to extract geometric features (curvature, gradient, elevation, etc.) directly from point cloud scans. These features are then used to construct a high- resolution local traversability map. Then, we design a spatial- temporal Bayesian Gaussian kernel (BGK) inference method to dynamically evaluate traversability scores, integrating historical and real-time data while considering factors such as slope, flatness, gradient, and uncertainty metrics. GPU acceleration is applied in the feature extraction step, and the system achieves real-time performance. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse terrain scenarios demonstrate that our method outper- forms SOTA approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, we develop an autonomous navigation framework integrated with the traversability map and validate it with a differential driven vehicle in complex outdoor envi- ronments. Our code will be open-source for further research and development by the community, https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/FSGP_BGK.</p></details> | accepted by IROS2025 |
| **[Structured Temporal Causality for Interpretable Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16511v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world multivariate time series anomalies are rare and often unlabeled. Additionally, prevailing methods rely on increasingly complex architectures tuned to benchmarks, detecting only fragments of anomalous segments and overstating performance. In this paper, we introduce OracleAD, a simple and interpretable unsupervised framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection. OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a single causal embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input window, effectively modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings then undergo a self-attention mechanism to project them into a shared latent space and capture spatial relationships. These relationships are not static, since they are modeled by a property that emerges from each variable's temporal dynamics. The projected embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS) representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified using a dual scoring mechanism based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS, enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and across individual variables. Since any noticeable SLS deviation originates from embeddings that violate the learned temporal causality of normal data, OracleAD directly pinpoints the root-cause variables at the embedding level. OracleAD achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and evaluation protocols, while remaining interpretable through SLS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we develop and analyze linear, structure-preserving time-stepping schemes for TFAC, including first-order and $\min\{1+\alpha, 2-\alpha\}$-order L1 discretizations, together with fast implementations based on the sum-of-exponentials (SOE) technique. A central feature of the proposed linear schemes is their unconditional preservation of both the discrete MBP and the variational energy dissipation law on general temporal meshes, including graded meshes commonly used for these problems. Leveraging the MBP of the numerical solutions, we establish sharp error estimates by employing the time-fractional Gro\"nwall inequality. Finally, numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes with an adaptive time-stepping strategy.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures, |

This can exacerbate load fluctuations, compromise power quality, and pose risks to the grid's stability and security. However, due to their dual role as controllable loads and energy storage devices, EVs have the potential to mitigate these fluctuations, balance the variability of renewable energy sources, and provide ancillary services that support grid stability. By leveraging the bidirectional flow of information and energy in smart grids, the adverse effects of EV charging can be minimized and even converted into beneficial outcomes through effective real-time management strategies. This paper explores the negative impacts of EV charging on the distribution system's real-time operations and outlines methods to transform these challenges into positive contributions. Additionally, it provides an in-depth analysis of the real-time management system for EV charging, focusing on state estimation and management strategies.</p></details> |  |

The equation involves a Caputo fractional derivative in the space variable and a tempered fractional derivative in the time variable, both of order in (0, 1). A finite difference approximation leads to a two-by-two block linear system of large dimensions. We conduct a spectral analysis of the associated matrix sequences, employing tools from Generalized Locally Toeplitz (GLT) theory, and construct the preconditioner guided by the GLT analysis. Numerical experiments are reported and commented, followed by concluding remarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time Measurement-based Optimization for Distribution System Operation Considering Battery Voltage and Thermal Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16408v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The secure operation of power distribution systems is challenged by the growing integration of distributed energy resources. Leveraging the flexibility of battery storage offers a cost-effective alternative to measures like generation curtailment, which results in energy losses. However, developing an effective operational model for battery storage is hindered by inaccurate grid models, unavailability of load data, nonlinear relationship between power injections and network states, intertemporal constraints, and complex electrochemical and thermal dynamics. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a data-driven operational control scheme for battery storage in distribution systems. Linear and convex quadratic operational constraints are constructed based on real-time distribution system and battery storage measurements. Lyapunov optimization decouples multi-period battery operation, enabling a real-time, forecast-free control strategy with low computational complexity. Numerical studies using nonlinear distribution system and battery storage simulators validate the effectiveness of the approach in ensuring secure distribution system operation and satisfaction of voltage and thermal constraints of battery storage.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, submitted to PSCC 2026</p></details> |

| **[Time-Varying Confounding Bias in Observational Geoscience with Application to Induced Seismicity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16360v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evidence derived primarily from physical models has identified saltwater disposal as the dominant causal factor that contributes to induced seismicity. To complement physical models, statistical/machine learning (ML) models are designed to measure associations from observational data, either with parametric regression models or more flexible ML models. However, it is often difficult to interpret the statistical significance of a parameter or the predicative power of a model as evidence of causation. We adapt a causal inference framework with the potential outcomes perspective to explicitly define what we meant by causal effect and declare necessary identification conditions to recover unbiased causal effect estimates. In particular, we illustrate the threat of time-varying confounding in observational longitudinal geoscience data through simulations and adapt established statistical methods for longitudinal analysis from the causal interference literature to estimate the effect of wastewater disposal on earthquakes in the Fort-Worth Basin of North Central Texas from 2013 to 2016.</p></details> |  |
| **[MGTS-Net: Exploring Graph-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion for Augmented Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16350v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research in time series forecasting has explored integrating multimodal features into models to improve accuracy. However, the accuracy of such methods is constrained by three key challenges: inadequate extraction of fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal integration of multimodal information, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features. To address these problems, we propose MGTS-Net, a Multimodal Graph-enhanced Network for Time Series forecasting. The model consists of three core components: (1) a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE), which optimizes feature encoders according to the characteristics of temporal, visual, and textual modalities to extract temporal features of fine-grained patterns; (2) a Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF), which constructs a heterogeneous graph to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment relationships and dynamically aggregates multimodal knowledge; (3) a Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP), which adapts to multi-scale features by dynamically weighting and fusing the outputs of short-term, medium-term, and long-term predictors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGTS-Net exhibits excellent performance with light weight and high efficiency. Compared with other state-of-the-art baseline models, our method achieves superior performance, validating the superiority of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Truly Subquadratic Time Algorithms for Diameter and Related Problems in Graphs of Bounded VC-dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16346v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We give the first truly subquadratic time algorithm, with $O^*(n^{2-1/18})$ running time, for computing the diameter of an $n$-vertex unit-disk graph, resolving a central open problem in the literature. Our result is obtained as an instance of a general framework, applicable to different graph families and distance problems. Surprisingly, our framework completely bypasses sublinear separators (or $r$-divisions) which were used in all previous algorithms. Instead, we use low-diameter decompositions in their most elementary form. We also exploit bounded VC-dimension of set systems associated with the input graph, as well as new ideas on geometric data structures. Among the numerous applications of the general framework, we obtain: 1. An $\tilde{O}(mn^{1-1/(2d)})$ time algorithm for computing the diameter of $m$-edge sparse unweighted graphs with constant VC-dimension $d$. The previously known algorithms by Ducoffe, Habib, and Viennot [SODA 2019] and Duraj, Konieczny, and Pot\c{e}pa [ESA 2024] are truly subquadratic only when the diameter is a small polynomial. Our result thus generalizes truly subquadratic time algorithms known for planar and minor-free graphs (in fact, it slightly improves the previous time bound for minor-free graphs). 2. An $\tilde{O}(n^{2-1/12})$ time algorithm for computing the diameter of intersection graphs of axis-aligned squares with arbitrary size. The best-known algorithm by Duraj, Konieczny, and Pot\c{e}pa [ESA 2024] only works for unit squares and is only truly subquadratic in the low-diameter regime. 3. The first algorithms with truly subquadratic complexity for other distance-related problems, including all-vertex eccentricities, Wiener index, and exact distance oracles.

Training large LMs requires tens of thousands of GPUs and housing them in the same datacenter (DC) is a challenge due to many constraints including availability of peak power. We focus on training such models across multiple DCs connected via the Wide-Area-Network (WAN). We built Atlas that speeds up the training time using novel workload-aware temporal bandwidth sharing and other design choices. While Atlas improves the training time, it does not completely eliminate the bubbles (idle GPU cycles). We built BubbleTea that runs prefill-as-a-service (part of LM inference) during the bubbles thus improving the GPU utilization without any impact on training. Compared to state-of-the-art designs, Atlas and BubbleTea together achieve up to 17x faster training, and up to 94% GPU utilization. The code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Near-linear time subhypergraph counting in bounded degeneracy hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16330v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counting small patterns in a large dataset is a fundamental algorithmic task. The most common version of this task is subgraph/homomorphism counting, wherein we count the number of occurrences of a small pattern graph $H$ in an input graph $G$. The study of this problem is a field in and of itself. Recently, both in theory and practice, there has been an interest in \emph{hypergraph} algorithms, where $G = (V,E)$ is a hypergraph. One can view $G$ as a set system where hyperedges are subsets of the universe $V$. Counting patterns $H$ in hypergraphs is less studied, although there are many applications in network science and database algorithms. Inspired by advances in the graph literature, we study when linear time algorithms are possible. We focus on input hypergraphs $G$ that have bounded \emph{degeneracy}, a well-studied concept for graph algorithms. We give a spectrum of definitions for hypergraph degeneracy that cover all existing notions. For each such definition, we give a precise characterization of the patterns $H$ that can be counted in (near) linear time. Specifically, we discover a set of ``obstruction patterns". If $H$ does not contain an obstruction, then the number of $H$-subhypergraphs can be counted exactly in $O(n\log n)$ time (where $n$ is the number of vertices in $G$). If $H$ contains an obstruction, then (assuming hypergraph variants of fine-grained complexity conjectures), there is a constant $\gamma > 0$, such that there is no $o(n^{1+\gamma})$ time algorithm for counting $H$-subhypergraphs. These sets of obstructions can be defined for all notions of hypergraph degeneracy.</p></details> |  |

| **[Distributed Spatial-Temporal Trajectory Optimization for Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle Swarm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17541v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Swarm trajectory optimization problems are a well-recognized class of multi-agent optimal control problems with strong nonlinearity. However, the heuristic nature of needing to set the final time for agents beforehand and the time-consuming limitation of the significant number of iterations prohibit the application of existing methods to large-scale swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in practice. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal trajectory optimization framework that accomplishes multi-UAV consensus based on the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) and uses Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) for fast local planning of individual UAVs. The introduced framework is a two-level architecture that employs Parameterized DDP (PDDP) as the trajectory optimizer for each UAV, and ADMM to satisfy the local constraints and accomplish the spatial-temporal parameter consensus among all UAVs. This results in a fully distributed algorithm called Distributed Parameterized DDP (D-PDDP). In addition, an adaptive tuning criterion based on the spectral gradient method for the penalty parameter is proposed to reduce the number of algorithmic iterations. Several simulation examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial and Temporal Boundaries in Difference-in-Differences: A Framework from Navier-Stokes Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11013v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a unified framework for identifying spatial and temporal boundaries of treatment effects in difference-in-differences designs. Starting from fundamental fluid dynamics equations (Navier-Stokes), we derive conditions under which treatment effects decay exponentially in space and time, enabling researchers to calculate explicit boundaries beyond which effects become undetectable. The framework encompasses both linear (pure diffusion) and nonlinear (advection-diffusion with chemical reactions) regimes, with testable scope conditions based on dimensionless numbers from physics (P\'eclet and Reynolds numbers). We demonstrate the framework's diagnostic capability using air pollution from coal-fired power plants. Analyzing 791 ground-based PM$_{2.5}$ monitors and 189,564 satellite-based NO$_2$ grid cells in the Western United States over 2019-2021, we find striking regional heterogeneity: within 100 km of coal plants, both pollutants show positive spatial decay (PM$_{2.5}$: $\kappa_s = 0.00200$, $d^* = 1,153$ km; NO$_2$: $\kappa_s = 0.00112$, $d^* = 2,062$ km), validating the framework. Beyond 100 km, negative decay parameters correctly signal that urban sources dominate and diffusion assumptions fail. Ground-level PM$_{2.5}$ decays approximately twice as fast as satellite column NO$_2$, consistent with atmospheric transport physics. The framework successfully diagnoses its own validity in four of eight analyzed regions, providing researchers with physics-based tools to assess whether their spatial difference-in-differences setting satisfies diffusion assumptions before applying the estimator. Our results demonstrate that rigorous boundary detection requires both theoretical derivation from first principles and empirical validation of underlying physical assumptions.</p></details> | 56 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Diverse Planning with Simulators via Linear Temporal Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17418v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents rely on automated planning algorithms to achieve their objectives. Simulation-based planning offers a significant advantage over declarative models in modelling complex environments. However, relying solely on a planner that produces a single plan may not be practical, as the generated plans may not always satisfy the agent's preferences. To address this limitation, we introduce $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$, a diverse planner explicitly designed for simulation-based planning problems. $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ utilises Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to define semantic diversity criteria, enabling agents to specify what constitutes meaningfully different plans. By integrating these LTL-based diversity models directly into the search process, $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ ensures the generation of semantically diverse plans, addressing a critical limitation of existing diverse planning approaches that may produce syntactically different but semantically identical solutions. Extensive evaluations on various benchmarks consistently demonstrate that $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ generates more diverse plans compared to a baseline approach. This work establishes the feasibility of semantically-guided diverse planning in simulation-based environments, paving the way for innovative approaches in realistic, non-symbolic domains where traditional model-based approaches fail.</p></details> |  |

Here, we propose MapMuse, a storytelling-based framework for interpreting spatio-temporal datasets, transforming them into compelling, narrative-driven experiences. We utilize large language models and employ retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based techniques to generate comprehensive stories. Drawing on principles common in cinematic storytelling, we emphasize clarity, emotional connection, and audience-centric design. As a case study, we analyze a dataset of taxi trajectories. Two perspectives are presented: a captivating story based on a heat map that visualizes millions of taxi trip endpoints to uncover urban mobility patterns; and a detailed narrative following a single long taxi journey, enriched with city landmarks and temporal shifts. By portraying locations as characters and movement as plot, we argue that data storytelling drives insight, engagement, and action from spatio-temporal information. The case study illustrates how MapMuse can bridge the gap between data complexity and human understanding. The aim of this short paper is to provide a glimpse to the potential of the cinematic storytelling technique as an effective communication tool for spatio-temporal data, as well as to describe open problems and opportunities for future research.</p></details> | 5 pages |

Accurate modeling of disease progression, such as type 2 diabetes, can enhance patient sub-phenotyping and inform effective and timely interventions. However, the problem is challenging due to the need to learn continuous-time dynamics of progression patterns based on irregular-time event samples and patient heterogeneity (\eg different progression rates and pathways). Existing mechanistic and data-driven methods either lack adaptability to learn from real-world data or fail to capture complex continuous-time dynamics on progression trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (TD-HNODE), which represents disease progression on clinically recognized trajectories as a temporally detailed hypergraph and learns the continuous-time progression dynamics via a neural ODE framework. TD-HNODE contains a learnable TD-Hypergraph Laplacian that captures the interdependency of disease complication markers within both intra- and inter-progression trajectories. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets demonstrate that TD-HNODE outperforms multiple baselines in modeling the progression of type 2 diabetes and related cardiovascular diseases.</p></details> |  |

Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical observations and spatial context.

To address this, we introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility), a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies, thereby quadratically reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM keeps the pretrained LLM backbone frozen, yielding faster training and lower memory usage. We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a 5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time.

Our approach harnesses the capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded, using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding and paragraph grounding settings. Experiments reveal that our method significantly outperforms all previously proposed LLM-based temporal grounding approaches and is either superior or comparable to specialized models, while maintaining a clear advantage against them in zero-shot evaluation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlights)</p></details> |

It has a key role in the scientific community, in part due to the large amount of video generated every day. Although we find extensive work in this task, we note that research remains focused on a small selection of video representations, which may lead to architectural overfitting in the long run. To address this issue, we propose an empirical study to investigate the impact of different video features on a classical architecture. We extract features for three well-known benchmarks, Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions and YouCookII, using video encoders based on CNNs, temporal reasoning and transformers. Our results show significant differences in the performance of our model by simply changing the video encoder, while also revealing clear patterns and errors derived from the use of certain features, ultimately indicating potential feature complementarity.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies focus on text-motion tasks, such as text-based motion generation, editing and question answering. In this study, we introduce the novel task of text-based human motion grounding (THMG), aimed at precisely localizing temporal segments corresponding to given textual descriptions within untrimmed motion sequences. Capturing global temporal information is crucial for the THMG task. However, Transformer-based models that rely on global temporal self-attention face challenges when handling long untrimmed sequences due to the quadratic computational cost. We address these challenges by proposing Text-controlled Motion Mamba (TM-Mamba), a unified model that integrates temporal global context, language query control, and spatial graph topology with only linear memory cost. The core of the model is a text-controlled selection mechanism which dynamically incorporates global temporal information based on text query. The model is further enhanced to be topology-aware through the integration of relational embeddings. For evaluation, we introduce BABEL-Grounding, the first text-motion dataset that provides detailed textual descriptions of human actions along with their corresponding temporal segments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of TM-Mamba on BABEL-Grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> |

Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive, task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments. These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content. This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.</p></details> |  |
| **[T3 Planner: A Self-Correcting LLM Framework for Robotic Motion Planning with Temporal Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16767v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating natural language instructions into executable motion plans is a fundamental challenge in robotics. Traditional approaches are typically constrained by their reliance on domain-specific expertise to customize planners, and often struggle with spatio-temporal couplings that usually lead to infeasible motions or discrepancies between task planning and motion execution. Despite the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-level semantic reasoning, hallucination could result in infeasible motion plans. In this paper, we introduce the T3 Planner, an LLM-enabled robotic motion planning framework that self-corrects it output with formal methods. The framework decomposes spatio-temporal task constraints via three cascaded modules, each of which stimulates an LLM to generate candidate trajectory sequences and examines their feasibility via a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) verifier until one that satisfies complex spatial, temporal, and logical constraints is found.Experiments across different scenarios show that T3 Planner significantly outperforms the baselines. The required reasoning can be distilled into a lightweight Qwen3-4B model that enables efficient deployment.

| **[Right Answer at the Right Time - Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Graph Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16715v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Question answering in temporal knowledge graphs requires retrieval that is both time-consistent and efficient. Existing RAG methods are largely semantic and typically neglect explicit temporal constraints, which leads to time-inconsistent answers and inflated token usage. We propose STAR-RAG, a temporal GraphRAG framework that relies on two key ideas: building a time-aligned rule graph and conducting propagation on this graph to narrow the search space and prioritize semantically relevant, time-consistent evidence. This design enforces temporal proximity during retrieval, reduces the candidate set of retrieval results, and lowers token consumption without sacrificing accuracy. Compared with existing temporal RAG approaches, STAR-RAG eliminates the need for heavy model training and fine-tuning, thereby reducing computational cost and significantly simplifying deployment.Extensive experiments on real-world temporal KG datasets show that our method achieves improved answer accuracy while consuming fewer tokens than strong GraphRAG baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Understanding under Deictic Frame of Reference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16685v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding time is fundamental to human cognition, where temporal experience is often conceptualized through spatial metaphors grounded in sensory-motor experience. For example, "summer is approaching" parallels "We are approaching the summer". In such expressions, humans rely on a frame of reference (FoR) to interpret meaning relative to a particular viewpoint. Extending this concept to time, a temporal frame of reference (t-FoR) defines how temporal relations are perceived relative to an experiencer's moment of "now". While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in natural language understanding, their ability to interpret and reason about time remains limited. In this work, we introduce TUuD (Temporal Understanding under Deictic t-FoR), a framework that evaluates how LLMs interpret time-event and event-event relations when the reference point of "now" dynamically shifts along a timeline. Following recent work on temporal cognition \cite{li2025other}, LLMs are prompted to rate the similarity between the current moment and a target event from 0.00 (completely dissimilar) to 1.00 (highly similar), where similarity quantifies perceived temporal alignment between the two points. Our results show that four evaluated LLMs exhibit measurable adaptation to a deictic t-FoR, with similarity ratings peaking around the present and decreasing toward past and future events. The adaptation, however, weakens beyond near-term contexts, suggesting that while LLMs display partial human-like temporal cognition, their temporal reasoning remains sensitive to reference-frame shifts and temporal distance.</p></details> | Under review |

In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings -- extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline -- serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI AI for Social Impact 2026.

In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal traversability assessment method, which aims to enable autonomous robots to effectively navigate through complex terrains. Our approach utilizes sparse Gaussian processes (SGP) to extract geometric features (curvature, gradient, elevation, etc.) directly from point cloud scans. These features are then used to construct a high- resolution local traversability map. Then, we design a spatial- temporal Bayesian Gaussian kernel (BGK) inference method to dynamically evaluate traversability scores, integrating historical and real-time data while considering factors such as slope, flatness, gradient, and uncertainty metrics. GPU acceleration is applied in the feature extraction step, and the system achieves real-time performance. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse terrain scenarios demonstrate that our method outper- forms SOTA approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, we develop an autonomous navigation framework integrated with the traversability map and validate it with a differential driven vehicle in complex outdoor envi- ronments. Our code will be open-source for further research and development by the community, https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/FSGP_BGK.</p></details> | accepted by IROS2025 |
| **[Structured Temporal Causality for Interpretable Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16511v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world multivariate time series anomalies are rare and often unlabeled. Additionally, prevailing methods rely on increasingly complex architectures tuned to benchmarks, detecting only fragments of anomalous segments and overstating performance. In this paper, we introduce OracleAD, a simple and interpretable unsupervised framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection. OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a single causal embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input window, effectively modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings then undergo a self-attention mechanism to project them into a shared latent space and capture spatial relationships. These relationships are not static, since they are modeled by a property that emerges from each variable's temporal dynamics. The projected embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS) representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified using a dual scoring mechanism based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS, enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and across individual variables. Since any noticeable SLS deviation originates from embeddings that violate the learned temporal causality of normal data, OracleAD directly pinpoints the root-cause variables at the embedding level. OracleAD achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and evaluation protocols, while remaining interpretable through SLS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The process is governed by surface diffusion and contact point migration, along with appropriate boundary conditions. By incorporating the predictor-corrector strategy and the backward differentiation formula for time discretization into the energy-stable parametric finite element method developed by Zhao et al. (2021), we successfully construct temporally high-order schemes. The resulting numerical scheme is semi-implicit, requiring the solution of a linear system at each time step. The well-posedness of the fully discretized system is established. Moreover, the method maintains the long-term mesh equidistribution property. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve the desired temporal accuracy, measured by the manifold distance, while maintaining good mesh quality throughout the evolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Computers and Mathematics with Applications</p></details> |

We propose RAVEN, a novel framework that integrates curriculum reinforcement learning with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance reasoning and cognitive capabilities for violation detection. RAVEN employs a progressive training strategy, combining precisely and coarsely annotated data, and leverages Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to develop emergent reasoning abilities without explicit reasoning annotations. Multiple hierarchical sophisticated reward mechanism ensures precise temporal grounding and consistent category prediction. Experiments on industrial datasets and public benchmarks show that RAVEN achieves superior performances in violation category accuracy and temporal interval localization. We also design a pipeline to deploy the RAVEN on the online Ad services, and online A/B testing further validates its practical applicability, with significant improvements in precision and recall. RAVEN also demonstrates strong generalization, mitigating the catastrophic forgetting issue associated with supervised fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 (Oral, Industry Track)</p></details> |

To further improve the model's adaptability to transient changes, we introduce Sparse STANE, which models time-specific changes as sparse perturbations, thereby improving interpretability. Unlike existing methods that either overlook cross-time similarities or enforce overly smooth evolution, Sparse STANE integrates temporal clustering with sparse deviation modeling to strike a flexible balance between persistence and change. We also provide non-asymptotic error guarantees of embeddings and show that our estimator can reliably identify changed node pairs when deviations are sparse. On synthetic and real-world political conflict networks, STANE and its extensions improve temporal clustering accuracy and structural recovery, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the potential of STANE in applications such as international relations modeling, where both persistent and transient connections matter. Our findings underscore the power of structured dynamic embeddings for revealing interpretable patterns in network evolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[StretchySnake: Flexible SSM Training Unlocks Action Recognition Across Spatio-Temporal Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16209v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) have emerged as a competitive alternative to transformers in various tasks. Their linear complexity and hidden-state recurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences, whereas attention becomes quadratically expensive. However, current training methods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to fully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are often trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic scaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models suffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and temporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal inflexibility. In the context of action recognition, this severely limits a model's ability to retain performance across both short- and long-form videos. Therefore, we propose a flexible training method that leverages and improves the inherent adaptability of SSMs. Our method samples videos at varying temporal and spatial resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates model weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This instills our SSM, which we call StretchySnake, with spatio-temporal flexibility and enables it to seamlessly handle videos ranging from short, fine-grained clips to long, complex activities. We introduce and compare five different variants of flexible training, and identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs. On short-action (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action (COIN, Breakfast) benchmarks, StretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines alike by up to 28%, with strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). Therefore, our method provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more robust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across diverse action recognition scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Prediction for Signal Temporal Logic Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25473v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term. Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Graph Reconfiguration for Always-Connected Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15593v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network redesign problems ask to modify the edges of a given graph to satisfy some properties. In temporal graphs, where edges are only active at certain times, we are sometimes only allowed to modify when the edges are going to be active. In practice, we might not even be able to perform all of the necessary modifications at once; changes must be applied step-by-step while the network is still in operation, meaning that the network must continue to satisfy some properties. To initiate a study in this area, we introduce the temporal graph reconfiguration problem. As a starting point, we consider the Layered Connectivity Reconfiguration problem in which every snapshot of the temporal graph must remain connected throughout the reconfiguration. We provide insights into how bridges can be reconfigured into non-bridges based on their reachability partitions, which lets us identify any edge as either changeable or unchangeable. From this we construct a polynomial-time algorithm that gives a valid reconfiguration sequence of length at most 2M^2 (where M is the number of temporal edges), or determines that reconfiguration is not possible. We also show that minimizing the length of the reconfiguration sequence is NP-hard via a reduction from vertex cover.</p></details> |  |

To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Functional Factor Analysis of Brain Connectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15580v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) examine functional connectivity (FC), or the statistical dependencies among distant brain regions. These analyses are typically exploratory, guiding future confirmatory research. In this work, we present an approach based on factor analysis (FA) that is well-suited to studying FC. FA is appealing in this context because its flexible model assumptions permit a guided investigation of its target subspace consistent with the exploratory role of connectivity analyses. However, applying FA to fMRI data poses three problems: (1) its target subspace captures short-range spatial dependencies that should be treated as noise, (2) it requires factorization of a massive spatial covariance, and (3) it overlooks temporal dependencies in the data. To address these limitations, we develop a factor model within the framework of functional data analysis--a field which views certain data as arising from smooth underlying curves. The proposed approach (1) uses matrix completion techniques to filter short-range spatial dependencies out of its target subspace, (2) employs a distributed algorithm for factorizing large-scale covariance matrices, and (3) leverages functional regression to exploit temporal dynamics. Together, these innovations yield a comprehensive and scalable method for studying FC.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) show strong general reasoning capabilities, they often fail to capture behavioral patterns central to human financial decisions-such as expert reliance under information asymmetry, loss-averse sensitivity, and feedback-driven temporal adjustment. We propose FinHEAR, a multi-agent framework for Human Expertise and Adaptive Risk-aware reasoning. FinHEAR orchestrates specialized LLM-based agents to analyze historical trends, interpret current events, and retrieve expert-informed precedents within an event-centric pipeline. Grounded in behavioral economics, it incorporates expert-guided retrieval, confidence-adjusted position sizing, and outcome-based refinement to enhance interpretability and robustness. Empirical results on curated financial datasets show that FinHEAR consistently outperforms strong baselines across trend prediction and trading tasks, achieving higher accuracy and better risk-adjusted returns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Referential Consistency: Do LLMs Favor Sequences Over Absolute Time References?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15513v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing acceptance of large language models (LLMs) as an alternative to knowledge sources marks a significant paradigm shift across various domains, including time-sensitive fields such as law, healthcare, and finance. To fulfill this expanded role, LLMs must not only be factually accurate but also demonstrate consistency across temporal dimensions, necessitating robust temporal reasoning capabilities. Despite this critical requirement, efforts to ensure temporal consistency in LLMs remain scarce including noticeable absence of endeavors aimed at evaluating or augmenting LLMs across temporal references in time-sensitive inquiries. In this paper, we seek to address this gap by introducing a novel benchmark entitled temporal referential consistency, accompanied by a resource TEMP-ReCon designed to benchmark a wide range of both open-source and closed-source LLMs with various linguistic contexts characterized by differing resource richness (including English, French, and Romanian). The findings emphasis that LLMs do exhibit insufficient temporal referent consistency. To address this, we propose \newmodel, a reasoning path alignment-based model that aims to enhance the temporal referential consistency of LLMs. Our empirical experiments substantiate the efficacy of UnTRaP compared to several baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP Main Long Paper 2025</p></details> |

Recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. Although deep learning has enabled significant advances in micro-expression recognition (MER), its effectiveness is limited by the scarcity of annotated ME datasets. This data limitation not only hinders generalization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured during training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial augmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation strategies that can better exploit motion characteristics. To address this gap, this paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method based on dynamic image. Rather than encoding the entire expression as a single onset-to-offset dynamic image (DI), our approach decomposes each expression sequence into two motion phases: onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset. A separate DI is generated for each phase, forming a Dual-phase DI augmentation strategy. These phase-specific representations enrich motion diversity and introduce complementary temporal cues that are crucial for recognizing subtle facial transitions. Extensive experiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures, including CNNs, Vision Transformer, and the lightweight LEARNet, demonstrate consistent performance improvements in recognition accuracy, unweighted F1-score, and unweighted average recall, which are crucial for addressing class imbalance in MER. When combined with spatial augmentations, our method achieves up to a 10\% relative improvement. The proposed augmentation is simple, model-agnostic, and effective in low-resource settings, offering a promising direction for robust and generalizable MER.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expediting Reinforcement Learning by Incorporating Knowledge About Temporal Causality in the Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15456v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with learning optimal policies for tasks where reward feedback is sparse and depends on a complex sequence of events in the environment. Probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) are finite-state formalisms that can capture temporal dependencies in the reward signal, along with nondeterministic task outcomes. While special RL algorithms can exploit this finite-state structure to expedite learning, PRMs remain difficult to modify and design by hand. This hinders the already difficult tasks of utilizing high-level causal knowledge about the environment, and transferring the reward formalism into a new domain with a different causal structure. This paper proposes a novel method to incorporate causal information in the form of Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into the reward formalism, thereby expediting policy learning and aiding the transfer of task specifications to new environments. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical result about convergence to optimal policy for our method, and demonstrate its strengths empirically.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please cite the proceedings version.

Although TPPs effectively capture temporal dynamics, their lack of interpretability remains a critical challenge. Recent advancements have introduced interpretable TPPs. However, these methods fail to incorporate numerical features, thereby limiting their ability to generate precise predictions. To address this issue, we propose Hybrid-Rule Temporal Point Processes (HRTPP), a novel framework that integrates temporal logic rules with numerical features, improving both interpretability and predictive accuracy in event modeling. HRTPP comprises three key components: basic intensity for intrinsic event likelihood, rule-based intensity for structured temporal dependencies, and numerical feature intensity for dynamic probability modulation. To effectively discover valid rules, we introduce a two-phase rule mining strategy with Bayesian optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a multi-criteria assessment framework, incorporating rule validity, model fitting, and temporal predictive accuracy. Experimental results on real-world medical datasets demonstrate that HRTPP outperforms state-of-the-art interpretable TPPs in terms of predictive performance and clinical interpretability. In case studies, the rules extracted by HRTPP explain the disease progression, offering valuable contributions to medical diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[TopoStreamer: Temporal Lane Segment Topology Reasoning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00709v4)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.0% mAP in lane segment perception and +1.7% OLS in centerline perception tasks.</p></details> |  |

This reduction enables us to apply existing algorithms for such well-studied computations of weakest pre-conditions, some of which are available as off-the-shelf solvers. We show the correctness of our denotational product construction by proving a preservation theorem under strong monad morphisms and an existence of suitable liftings along a fibration. We instantiate our framework with both probabilistic and angelic nondeterministic higher-order programs, and implement an automated solver for the probabilistic case based on the existing solver developed by Kura and Unno.

This approach is impractical due to the limited network of fixed-ground magnetometer stations, making long-range (several hundred kilometers long) aeromagnetic surveys for anomaly map-making infeasible. To address these challenges, we developed the Extended Reference Station Model (ERSM). ERSM applies a longitudinal correction and regression model to an extended reference ground magnetometer station (ERS) to produce an estimate of the local temporal disturbance field. ERSM is regression model-agnostic, so we implemented a linear regression, a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) regression, and a neural-network regression model to assess performance benefits. Our results show typical performance below 10nT root mean square error and median performance below 5nT for typical use with the kNN and neural-net model for farther distances and below 5nT performance using the linear regression model on stations with proximity. We also consider how space-weather events, water-body separation, and proximity to polar regions affect the model performance based on ERS selection.</p></details> |  |

We show that STEMMED can be decomposed node-by-node, suggesting a tractable distributed learning procedure. Simulation shows that this learning algorithm can accurately recover known parameters of STEMMED, especially for small networks and long data-horizons. Next, we turn this node-by-node decomposition into an online cooperative multi-period forecasting framework, which is asymptotically robust to operational errors, to facilitate Opioid-related overdose death (OOD) trends forecasting among neighboring communities. In our numerical study, we parameterize STEMMED using individual-level OOD data and county-level demographics in Massachusetts. For any node, we observe that OODs within the same drug class from nearby locations have the greatest influence on future OOD trends. Furthermore, the expected proportion of OODs triggered by historical events varies greatly across counties, ranging between 30%-70%. Finally, in a practical online forecasting setting, STEMMED-based cooperative framework reduces prediction error by 60% on average, compared to well-established forecasting models. Leveraging the growing abundance of public health surveillance data, STEMMED can provide accurate forecasts of local OOD trends and highlight complex interactions between OODs across communities and drug types. Moreover, STEMMED enhances synergies between local and federal government entities, which is critical to designing impactful policy interventions.</p></details> |  |

This capability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this paper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a video generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images as the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large pretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but also the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal consistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that explicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, target frame is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing trajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable transformations. The reasoning tokens are then dropped after a few steps to avoid the high computational cost of rendering a full video. To validate ChronoEdit, we introduce PBench-Edit, a new benchmark of image-prompt pairs for contexts that require physical consistency, and demonstrate that ChronoEdit surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both visual fidelity and physical plausibility.

Traditional deterministic schedules break down when reality deviates from nominal plans, triggering costly last-minute repairs. This thesis combines offline constraint-programming (CP) optimisation with online temporal-network execution to create schedules that remain feasible under worst-case uncertainty. First, we build a CP model of the flexible job-shop with per-job deadline tasks and insert an optimal buffer $\Delta^*$ to obtain a fully pro-active baseline. We then translate the resulting plan into a Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) and verify dynamic controllability, which guarantees that a real-time dispatcher can retime activities for every bounded duration realisation without violating resource or deadline constraints. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the open Kacem~1--4 benchmark suite show that our hybrid approach eliminates 100\% of deadline violations observed in state-of-the-art meta-heuristic schedules, while adding only 3--5\% makespan overhead. Scalability experiments confirm that CP solve-times and STNU checks remain sub-second on medium-size instances. The work demonstrates how temporal-network reasoning can bridge the gap between proactive buffering and dynamic robustness, moving industry a step closer to truly digital, self-correcting factories.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages 2 column, 11 figures.

| **[Neural Implicit Flow Fields for Spatio-Temporal Motion Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14827v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe and efficient robot operation in complex human environments can benefit from good models of site-specific motion patterns. Maps of Dynamics (MoDs) provide such models by encoding statistical motion patterns in a map, but existing representations use discrete spatial sampling and typically require costly offline construction. We propose a continuous spatio-temporal MoD representation based on implicit neural functions that directly map coordinates to the parameters of a Semi-Wrapped Gaussian Mixture Model. This removes the need for discretization and imputation for unevenly sampled regions, enabling smooth generalization across both space and time. Evaluated on a large public dataset with long-term real-world people tracking data, our method achieves better accuracy of motion representation and smoother velocity distributions in sparse regions while still being computationally efficient, compared to available baselines. The proposed approach demonstrates a powerful and efficient way of modeling complex human motion patterns.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress in video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking. Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG, particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cognitive-Aligned Spatio-Temporal Large Language Models For Next Point-of-Interest Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14702v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems, which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays, and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns, profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of 2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in "Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of CoAST.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Among the different logics considered, Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) is a powerful and commonly used logic, which can succinctly encode many interesting timed properties especially when past and future modalities are used together. In this work, we develop a new approach for MITL model checking in the pointwise semantics, where our focus is on integrating past and maximizing determinism in the translated automata. Towards this goal, we define synchronous networks of timed automata with shared variables and show that the past fragment of MITL can be translated in linear time to synchronous networks of deterministic timed automata. Moreover determinism can be preserved even when the logic is extended with future modalities at the top-level of the formula. We further extend this approach to the full MITL with past, translating it into networks of generalized timed automata (GTA) with future clocks (which extend timed automata and event clock automata). We present an SCC-based liveness algorithm to analyse GTA. We implement our translation in a prototype tool which handles both finite and infinite timed words and supports past modalities. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in MITL satisfiability checking in pointwise semantics on a benchmark suite of 72 formulas. Finally, we implement an end-to-end model checking algorithm for pointwise semantics and demonstrate its effectiveness on two well-known benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process.

Long videos often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling (EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity, requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained and continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the AMOS 2022 dataset obtains an average Dice of 85.09%, IoU of 76.66%, ASSD of 19.49 mm, and VOE of 23.34%, indicating strong generalization across different datasets. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of HANS-Net in providing anatomically consistent, accurate, and confident liver and tumor segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript under review in IEEE Transactions on Radiation and Plasma Medical Sciences</p></details> |

With advancements in autonomous driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with 4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene understanding.

However, many approaches struggle with reliability in the target domain, an issue particularly critical in medical image segmentation, where accuracy and anatomical validity are essential. This challenge is further exacerbated in spatio-temporal data, where the lack of temporal consistency can significantly degrade segmentation quality, and particularly in echocardiography, where the presence of artifacts and noise can further hinder segmentation performance. To address these issues, we present RL4Seg3D, an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 2D + time echocardiography segmentation. RL4Seg3D integrates novel reward functions and a fusion scheme to enhance key landmark precision in its segmentations while processing full-sized input videos. By leveraging reinforcement learning for image segmentation, our approach improves accuracy, anatomical validity, and temporal consistency while also providing, as a beneficial side effect, a robust uncertainty estimator, which can be used at test time to further enhance segmentation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on over 30,000 echocardiographic videos, showing that it outperforms standard domain adaptation techniques without the need for any labels on the target domain.

Conventional detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences, lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities.

Coordinated building energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems. Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees, and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management. STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and maintains effectiveness across different building types.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce a maximum-entropy approach to temporal networks and with basic assumptions on constraints, the corresponding network ensembles admit a modular and interpretable representation: a set of global time processes and a static maximum-entropy edge, e.g. node pair, probability. This time-edge labels factorization yields closed-form log-likelihoods, degree, clustering and motif expectations, and yields a whole class of effective generative models. We provide maximum-entropy derivation of an inhomogeneous Poisson edge intensity for temporal networks via functional optimization over path entropy, connecting NHPP modeling to maximum-entropy network ensembles. NHPP consistently improve log-likelihood over generic Poisson processes, while the maximum-entropy edge labels recover strength constraints and reproduce expected unique-degree curves. We discuss the limitations of this framework and how it can be integrated with multivariate Hawkes calibration procedures, renewal theory, and neural kernel estimation in graph neural networks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 25 figures |

Despite its significance, this problem remains underexplored compared to temporal link prediction or node forecasting. Existing methods often rely on snapshot-based or recurrent architectures that either lose fine-grained temporal information or struggle with long-range dependencies. Moreover, local message-passing approaches suffer from oversmoothing and oversquashing, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal structures. We introduce T3former, a novel Topological Temporal Transformer that leverages sliding-window topological and spectral descriptors as first-class tokens, integrated via a specialized Descriptor-Attention mechanism. This design preserves temporal fidelity, enhances robustness, and enables principled cross-modal fusion without rigid discretization. T3former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including dynamic social networks, brain functional connectivity datasets, and traffic networks. It also offers theoretical guarantees of stability under temporal and structural perturbations. Our results highlight the power of combining topological and spectral insights for advancing the frontier of temporal graph learning.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

However, multi-agent collaboration faces critical safety challenges, such as hallucination amplification and error injection and propagation. This paper presents GUARDIAN, a unified method for detecting and mitigating multiple safety concerns in GUARDing Intelligent Agent collaboratioNs. By modeling the multi-agent collaboration process as a discrete-time temporal attributed graph, GUARDIAN explicitly captures the propagation dynamics of hallucinations and errors. The unsupervised encoder-decoder architecture incorporating an incremental training paradigm learns to reconstruct node attributes and graph structures from latent embeddings, enabling the identification of anomalous nodes and edges with unparalleled precision. Moreover, we introduce a graph abstraction mechanism based on the Information Bottleneck Theory, which compresses temporal interaction graphs while preserving essential patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate GUARDIAN's effectiveness in safeguarding LLM multi-agent collaborations against diverse safety vulnerabilities, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with efficient resource utilization.

| **[The Past Still Matters: A Temporally-Valid Data Discovery System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13662v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, the proliferation of public and enterprise data lakes has fueled intensive research into data discovery, aiming to identify the most relevant data from vast and complex corpora to support diverse user tasks. Significant progress has been made through the development of innovative index structures, similarity measures, and querying infrastructures. Despite these advances, a critical aspect remains overlooked: relevance is time-varying. Existing discovery methods largely ignore this temporal dimension, especially when explicit date/time metadata is missing. To fill this gap, we outline a vision for a data discovery system that incorporates the temporal dimension of data. Specifically, we define the problem of temporally-valid data discovery and argue that addressing it requires techniques for version discovery, temporal lineage inference, change log synthesis, and time-aware data discovery. We then present a system architecture to deliver these techniques, before we summarize research challenges and opportunities. As such, we lay the foundation for a new class of data discovery systems, transforming how we interact with evolving data lakes.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemoTime: Memory-Augmented Temporal Knowledge Graph Enhanced Large Language Model Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13614v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning abilities, but struggle with temporal understanding, especially when questions involve multiple entities, compound operators, and evolving event sequences. Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which capture vast amounts of temporal facts in a structured format, offer a reliable source for temporal reasoning. However, existing TKG-based LLM reasoning methods still struggle with four major challenges: maintaining temporal faithfulness in multi-hop reasoning, achieving multi-entity temporal synchronization, adapting retrieval to diverse temporal operators, and reusing prior reasoning experience for stability and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose MemoTime, a memory-augmented temporal knowledge graph framework that enhances LLM reasoning through structured grounding, recursive reasoning, and continual experience learning. MemoTime decomposes complex temporal questions into a hierarchical Tree of Time, enabling operator-aware reasoning that enforces monotonic timestamps and co-constrains multiple entities under unified temporal bounds. A dynamic evidence retrieval layer adaptively selects operator-specific retrieval strategies, while a self-evolving experience memory stores verified reasoning traces, toolkit decisions, and sub-question embeddings for cross-type reuse. Comprehensive experiments on multiple temporal QA benchmarks show that MemoTime achieves overall state-of-the-art results, outperforming the strong baseline by up to 24.0%. Furthermore, MemoTime enables smaller models (e.g., Qwen3-4B) to achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG Meets Temporal Graphs: Time-Sensitive Modeling and Retrieval for Evolving Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13590v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge is inherently time-sensitive and continuously evolves over time. Although current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enrich LLMs with external knowledge, they largely ignore this temporal nature. This raises two challenges for RAG. First, current RAG methods lack effective time-aware representations. Same facts of different time are difficult to distinguish with vector embeddings or conventional knowledge graphs. Second, most RAG evaluations assume a static corpus, leaving a blind spot regarding update costs and retrieval stability as knowledge evolves. To make RAG time-aware, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (TG-RAG), which models external corpora as a bi-level temporal graph consisting of a temporal knowledge graph with timestamped relations and a hierarchical time graph. Multi-granularity temporal summaries are generated for each time node to capture both key events and broader trends at that time. The design supports incremental updates by extracting new temporal facts from the incoming corpus and merging them into the existing graph. The temporal graph explicitly represents identical facts at different times as distinct edges to avoid ambiguity, and the time hierarchy graph allows only generating reports for new leaf time nodes and their ancestors, ensuring effective and efficient updates. During inference, TG-RAG dynamically retrieves a subgraph within the temporal and semantic scope of the query, enabling precise evidence gathering. Moreover, we introduce ECT-QA, a time-sensitive question-answering dataset featuring both specific and abstract queries, along with a comprehensive evaluation protocol designed to assess incremental update capabilities of RAG systems. Extensive experiments show that TG-RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in handling temporal knowledge and incremental updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-Term Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of Monthly Rainfall in West Bengal Using Ensemble Learning Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13927v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rainfall forecasting plays a critical role in climate adaptation, agriculture, and water resource management. This study develops long-term forecasts of monthly rainfall across 19 districts of West Bengal using a century-scale dataset spanning 1900-2019. Daily rainfall records are aggregated into monthly series, resulting in 120 years of observations for each district. The forecasting task involves predicting the next 108 months (9 years, 2011-2019) while accounting for temporal dependencies and spatial interactions among districts. To address the nonlinear and complex structure of rainfall dynamics, we propose a hierarchical modeling framework that combines regression-based forecasting of yearly features with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for monthly prediction. Yearly features, such as annual totals, quarterly proportions, variability measures, skewness, and extremes, are first forecasted using regression models that incorporate both own lags and neighboring-district lags. These forecasts are then integrated as auxiliary inputs into an MLP model, which captures nonlinear temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in the monthly series. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical regression-MLP architecture provides robust long-term spatio-temporal forecasts, offering valuable insights for agriculture, irrigation planning, and water conservation strategies.</p></details> | 25 pages, 22 figures |

However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this challenge, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent MLLMs indeed struggle to correctly answer "spatio-temporal" prompts. Building on this dataset, we study two spatio-temporal LLM (STLLM) baselines: 1) STLLM-3D, which directly fuses point cloud, video, and text representations as inputs to the LLM; and 2) STLLM-Aligner, which aligns spatial context with video and text before LLM decoding. Both baselines aim to enhance spatial understanding of environments and temporal grounding of egocentric observations. On REA, the STLLM baselines outperform existing models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.

| **[MTIL: Encoding Full History with Mamba for Temporal Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12410v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard imitation learning (IL) methods have achieved considerable success in robotics, yet often rely on the Markov assumption, which falters in long-horizon tasks where history is crucial for resolving perceptual ambiguity. This limitation stems not only from a conceptual gap but also from a fundamental computational barrier: prevailing architectures like Transformers are often constrained by quadratic complexity, rendering the processing of long, high-dimensional observation sequences infeasible. To overcome this dual challenge, we introduce Mamba Temporal Imitation Learning (MTIL). Our approach represents a new paradigm for robotic learning, which we frame as a practical synthesis of World Model and Dynamical System concepts. By leveraging the linear-time recurrent dynamics of State Space Models (SSMs), MTIL learns an implicit, action-oriented world model that efficiently encodes the entire trajectory history into a compressed, evolving state. This allows the policy to be conditioned on a comprehensive temporal context, transcending the confines of Markovian approaches. Through extensive experiments on simulated benchmarks (ACT, Robomimic, LIBERO) and on challenging real-world tasks, MTIL demonstrates superior performance against SOTA methods like ACT and Diffusion Policy, particularly in resolving long-term temporal ambiguities. Our findings not only affirm the necessity of full temporal context but also validate MTIL as a powerful and a computationally feasible approach for learning long-horizon, non-Markovian behaviors from high-dimensional observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 2025. 8 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Decentralizing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Causal Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07829v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can find an optimal policy for a single agent to accomplish a particular task. However, many real-world problems require multiple agents to collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. For example, a robot executing a task in a warehouse may require the assistance of a drone to retrieve items from high shelves. In Decentralized Multi-Agent RL (DMARL), agents learn independently and then combine their policies at execution time, but often must satisfy constraints on compatibility of local policies to ensure that they can achieve the global task when combined. In this paper, we study how providing high-level symbolic knowledge to agents can help address unique challenges of this setting, such as privacy constraints, communication limitations, and performance concerns. In particular, we extend the formal tools used to check the compatibility of local policies with the team task, making decentralized training with theoretical guarantees usable in more scenarios. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that symbolic knowledge about the temporal evolution of events in the environment can significantly expedite the learning process in DMARL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/corazza/tcdmarl</p></details> |
| **[Temporal-Difference Variational Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07812v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning models in real-world applications must continuously learn new tasks to adapt to shifts in the data-generating distribution. Yet, for Continual Learning (CL), models often struggle to balance learning new tasks (plasticity) with retaining previous knowledge (memory stability). Consequently, they are susceptible to Catastrophic Forgetting, which degrades performance and undermines the reliability of deployed systems. In the Bayesian CL literature, variational methods tackle this challenge by employing a learning objective that recursively updates the posterior distribution while constraining it to stay close to its previous estimate. Nonetheless, we argue that these methods may be ineffective due to compounding approximation errors over successive recursions. To mitigate this, we propose new learning objectives that integrate the regularization effects of multiple previous posterior estimations, preventing individual errors from dominating future posterior updates and compounding over time. We reveal insightful connections between these objectives and Temporal-Difference methods, a popular learning mechanism in Reinforcement Learning and Neuroscience. Experiments on challenging CL benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates Catastrophic Forgetting, outperforming strong Variational CL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Human Motion with Temporally Conditional Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12573v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over state-of-the-art approaches.

Leveraging the internal model principle and root locus techniques, we show that temporal variabilities impose intrinsic limits on the achievable rate of convergence. For a problem with condition ratio $\kappa$ and time variation whose model has degree $n$, we show that the worst-case convergence rate of any minimal-order gradient-based algorithm is $\rho_\text{TV} = (\frac{\kappa-1}{\kappa+1})^{1/n}$. This bound reveals a fundamental tradeoff between problem conditioning, temporal complexity, and rate of convergence. We further construct explicit controllers that attain the bound for low-degree models of time variation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention for Cross-view Online Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17025v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a critical task in video sequence classification within computer vision, Online Action Detection (OAD) has garnered significant attention. The sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA) model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the probabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features. Experiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs), cross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, accepted at IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM), in press</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Recognize Correctly Completed Procedure Steps in Egocentric Assembly Videos through Spatio-Temporal Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12385v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object, while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%, respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 7 figures and 5 tables in the main paper and one figure and table in the appendix.

| **[Menger's Theorem for Temporal Paths (Not Walks)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15251v4)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A (directed) temporal graph is a (directed) graph whose edges are available only at specific times during its (discretized) lifetime $\tau$. In this setting, we ask that walks respect the temporal aspect by defining $\textit{temporal walks}$ as sequences of adjacent edges whose appearing times are either strictly increasing or non-decreasing (here called non-strict), depending on the scenario. The notion of disjointness between walks is also not unique: two walks are $\textit{vertex-disjoint}$ if they do not share a vertex, and are $\textit{temporal vertex-disjoint}$ if they do not share a vertex at the same time. Thus a $\textit{temporal path}$ is a temporal walk where no repetition of vertices, at any time, is allowed. This is an important distinction that separates the interpretation of our results from those of previous works on the topic. In this paper we focus on various questions regarding connectivity (maximum number of disjoint paths) and robustness (minimum size of a cut) between a given pair of vertices. Such problems are related to the well-known Menger's Theorem on static graphs. We explore all possible interpretations of such problems, according to vertex and temporal vertex-disjointness, strict and non-strict temporal paths, and directed and undirected temporal graphs. We present a number of new results, the main of which states that Menger's Theorem holds when the maximum number of temporal vertex-disjoint temporal paths is equal to 1.</p></details> |  |
| **[CurriFlow: Curriculum-Guided Depth Fusion with Optical Flow-Based Temporal Alignment for 3D Semantic Scene Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12362v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion. CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual, and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.</p></details> |  |
| **[OST-Bench: Evaluating the Capabilities of MLLMs in Online Spatio-temporal Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07984v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and benchmark are available.

| **[Learning Adaptive and Temporally Causal Video Tokenization in a 1D Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17011v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose AdapTok, an adaptive temporal causal video tokenizer that can flexibly allocate tokens for different frames based on video content. AdapTok is equipped with a block-wise masking strategy that randomly drops tail tokens of each block during training, and a block causal scorer to predict the reconstruction quality of video frames using different numbers of tokens. During inference, an adaptive token allocation strategy based on integer linear programming is further proposed to adjust token usage given predicted scores. Such design allows for sample-wise, content-aware, and temporally dynamic token allocation under a controllable overall budget. Extensive experiments for video reconstruction and generation on UCF-101 and Kinetics-600 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Without additional image data, AdapTok consistently improves reconstruction quality and generation performance under different token budgets, allowing for more scalable and token-efficient generative video modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/VisionXLab/AdapTok</p></details> |
| **[Vectorized Video Representation with Easy Editing via Hierarchical Spatio-Temporally Consistent Proxy Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12256v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability, this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand, the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally consistent video editing.</p></details> |  |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism, implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves original feature information through residual connections, which is critical for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint was submitted to IEEE TrustCom 2025.

We present the first systematic study of temporal bias in LALMs, revealing a key limitation in their timestamp prediction. For example, when asked "At which second does the lecturer introduce the key formula?", models often predict timestamps that are consistently earlier or later than the ground truth. Through controlled experiments on timestamped datasets, we find that temporal bias (i) is prevalent across datasets and models, (ii) increases with audio length - even accumulating to tens of seconds in extended recordings, and (iii) varies across event types and positions. We quantify this effect with the Temporal Bias Index (TBI), measuring systematic misalignment in predicted event timings, and complement it with a visualization framework. Our findings highlight a fundamental limitation in current LALMs and call for the development of temporally robust architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[State Space Prompting via Gathering and Spreading Spatio-Temporal Information for Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12160v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering (IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by 2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.</p></details> |  |

However, detecting individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts and deviations from established routines but also the identification of individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by The 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Anomaly Detection</p></details> |

We demonstrate that our approach combines the strengths of both spatial reduced order models (ROMs) as well as spectral decompositions. By optimizing for the operator that evolves a system state from one timestep to the next, rather than the system state itself, we gain both the compressive power of spatial ROMs as well as the intuitive physical dynamics of spectral methods. The latter property is of particular interest in graphics applications, where user control of fluid phenomena is of high demand. We demonstrate this in various applications including spatial and temporal modulation tools and fluid upscaling with added turbulence. We adapt DMD for graphics applications by reducing computational overhead, incorporating user-defined force inputs, and optimizing memory usage with randomized SVD. The integration of OptDMD and DMD with Control (DMDc) facilitates noise-robust reconstruction and real-time user interaction. We demonstrate the technique's robustness across diverse simulation scenarios, including artistic editing, time-reversal, and super-resolution. Through experimental validation on challenging scenarios, such as colliding vortex rings and boundary-interacting plumes, our method also exhibits superior performance and fidelity with significantly fewer basis functions compared to existing spatial ROMs. The inherent linearity of the DMD operator enables unique application modes, such as time-reversible fluid simulation. This work establishes another avenue for developing real-time, high-quality fluid simulations, enriching the space of fluid simulation techniques in interactive graphics and animation.</p></details> |  |

We conduct a user study comparing three alternatives-aggregated, trellis, and spiral line charts against standard line charts on tasks involving trend identification, making predictions, and decision-making. We found aggregated charts performed similarly to standard charts and support more accurate trend recognition and prediction; trellis and spiral charts generally lag. We also examined the impact on decision-making via a trust game. The results showed similar trust in standard and aggregated charts, varied trust in spiral charts, and a lean toward distrust in trellis charts. These findings provide guidance for practitioners choosing visualization strategies for dense temporal data.</p></details> |  |

The framework of temporal hypergraphs makes it possible to represent them by taking into account the higher-order and temporal nature of the interactions. However, the corresponding datasets are often incomplete and/or limited in size and duration, and surrogate time-varying hypergraphs able to reproduce their statistical features constitute interesting substitutions, especially to understand how dynamical processes unfold on group interactions. Here, we present a new temporal hypergraph model, the Emerging Activity Temporal Hypergraph (EATH), which can be fed by parameters measured in a dataset and create synthetic datasets with similar properties. In the model, each node has an independent underlying activity dynamic and the overall system activity emerges from the nodes dynamics, with temporal group interactions resulting from both the activity of the nodes and memory mechanisms. We first show that the EATH model can generate surrogate hypergraphs of several empirical datasets of face-to-face interactions, mimicking temporal and topological properties at the node and hyperedge level. We also showcase the possibility to use the resulting synthetic data in simulations of higher-order contagion dynamics, comparing the outcome of such process on original and surrogate datasets. Finally, we illustrate the flexibility of the model, which can generate synthetic hypergraphs with tunable properties: as an example, we generate "hybrid" temporal hypergraphs, which mix properties of different empirical datasets. Our work opens several perspectives, from the generation of synthetic realistic hypergraphs describing contexts where data collection is difficult to a deeper understanding of dynamical processes on temporal hypergraphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main document: 20 pages, 10 figures; Supplementary Material: 37 pages, 54 figures</p></details> |

They leverage timing variations of several state-holding microarchitectural components and have been demonstrated across instruction set architectures and hardware implementations. Analogously to memory protection, Ge et al. have proposed time protection for preventing information leakage via timing channels. They also showed that time protection calls for hardware support. This work leverages the open and extensible RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) to introduce the temporal fence instruction fence.t, which provides the required mechanisms by clearing vulnerable microarchitectural state and guaranteeing a history-independent context-switch latency. We propose and discuss three different implementations of fence.t and implement them on an experimental version of the seL4 microkernel and CVA6, an open-source, in-order, application class, 64-bit RISC-V core. We find that a complete, systematic, ISA-supported erasure of all non-architectural core components is the most effective implementation while featuring a low implementation effort, a minimal performance overhead of less than 1%, and negligible hardware costs.</p></details> |  |

Currently, satisfying complex requirements in cyber-physical systems requires significant manual effort and domain expertise to develop the underlying reachability programs. This high development effort limits the broader adoption of reachability analysis for complex verification problems. To address this, pyspect provides a method-agnostic approach to performing reachability analysis for verifying a temporal logic specification via temporal logic trees (TLTs). It enables the specification of complex safety and liveness requirements using high-level logic formulations that are independent of any particular reachability technique or set representation. As a result, pyspect allows for the comparison of different reachability implementations, such as Hamilton-Jacobi and Hybrid Zonotope-based reachability analysis, for the same temporal logic specification. This design separates the concerns of implementation developers (who develop numerical procedures for reachability) and end-users (who write specifications). Through a simple vehicle example, we demonstrate how pyspect simplifies the synthesis of reachability programs, promotes specification reusability, and facilitates side-by-side comparisons of reachability techniques for complex tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the 64th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control</p></details> |
| **[Information-theoretic analysis of temporal dependence in discrete stochastic processes: Application to precipitation predictability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11276v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the temporal dependence of precipitation is key to improving weather predictability and developing efficient stochastic rainfall models. We introduce an information-theoretic approach to quantify memory effects in discrete stochastic processes and apply it to daily precipitation records across the contiguous United States. The method is based on the predictability gain, a quantity derived from block entropy that measures the additional information provided by higher-order temporal dependencies. This statistic, combined with a bootstrap-based hypothesis testing and Fisher's method, enables a robust memory estimator from finite data. Tests with generated sequences show that this estimator outperforms other model-selection criteria such as AIC and BIC. Applied to precipitation data, the analysis reveals that daily rainfall occurrence is well described by low-order Markov chains, exhibiting regional and seasonal variations, with stronger correlations in winter along the West Coast and in summer in the Southeast, consistent with known climatological patterns. Overall, our findings establish a framework for building parsimonious stochastic descriptions, useful when addressing spatial heterogeneity in the memory structure of precipitation dynamics, and support further advances in real-time, data-driven forecasting schemes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Cooperative Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11255v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical cooperative game theory assumes that the worth of a coalition depends only on the set of agents involved, but in practice, it may also depend on the order in which agents arrive. Motivated by such scenarios, we introduce temporal cooperative games (TCG), where the worth $v$ becomes a function of the sequence of agents $\pi$ rather than just the set $S$. This shift calls for rethinking the underlying axioms. A key property in this temporal framework is the incentive for optimal arrival (I4OA), which encourages agents to join in the order maximizing total worth. Alongside, we define two additional properties: online individual rationality (OIR), incentivizing earlier agents to invite more participants, and sequential efficiency (SE), ensuring that the total worth of any sequence is fully distributed among its agents. We identify a class of reward-sharing mechanisms uniquely characterized by these three properties. The classical Shapley value does not directly apply here, so we construct its natural analogs in two variants: the sequential world, where rewards are defined for each sequence-player pair, and the extended world, where rewards are defined for each player alone. Properties of efficiency, additivity, and null player uniquely determine these Shapley analogs in both worlds. Importantly, the Shapley analogs are disjoint from mechanisms satisfying I4OA, OIR, and SE, and this conflict persists even for restricted classes such as convex and simple TCGs. Our findings thus uncover a fundamental tension: when players arrive sequentially, reward-sharing mechanisms satisfying desirable temporal properties must inherently differ from Shapley-inspired ones, opening new questions for defining fair and efficient solution concepts in TCGs.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, under review</p></details> |

This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0 percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\% vs 68.4\% baseline), cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\% relative improvement), and 8.7\% relative improvement on real robot tasks.

Notably, TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while improving task success rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to AAAI 2026, currently under review</p></details> |
| **[Synchronous Team Semantics for Temporal Logics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18667v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present team semantics for two of the most important linear and branching time specification languages, Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and Computation Tree Logic (CTL). With team semantics, LTL is able to express hyperproperties, which have in the last decade been identified as a key concept in the verification of information flow properties. We study basic properties of the logic and classify the computational complexity of its satisfiability, path, and model checking problem. Further, we examine how extensions of the basic logic react to adding additional atomic operators. Finally, we compare its expressivity to the one of HyperLTL, another recently introduced logic for hyperproperties. Our results show that LTL with team semantics is a viable alternative to HyperLTL, which complements the expressivity of HyperLTL and has partially better algorithmic properties. For CTL with team semantics, we investigate the computational complexity of the satisfiability and model checking problem. The satisfiability problem is shown to be EXPTIME-complete while we show that model checking is PSPACE-complete.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version with corrected proofs</p></details> |

A two-stage modelling framework was used: Lasso was used to identify a parsimonious set of socio economic and health-service covariates, and a Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) model incorporated these predictors with structured spatial and temporal random effects. This research demonstrates that socio-economic disadvantage and service accessibility drive EE-O/A incidence, underscoring the need for targeted mental-health interventions and resource allocation in impoverished FNQ communities. Limitations include reliance on cross-sectional census data for covariates and potential ecological bias from data fusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Alignment Guidance: On-Manifold Sampling in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11057v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success as generative models. However, even a well-trained model can accumulate errors throughout the generation process. These errors become particularly problematic when arbitrary guidance is applied to steer samples toward desired properties, which often breaks sample fidelity. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address the off-manifold phenomenon observed in diffusion models. Our approach leverages a time predictor to estimate deviations from the desired data manifold at each timestep, identifying that a larger time gap is associated with reduced generation quality. We then design a novel guidance mechanism, `Temporal Alignment Guidance' (TAG), attracting the samples back to the desired manifold at every timestep during generation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that TAG consistently produces samples closely aligned with the desired manifold at each timestep, leading to significant improvements in generation quality across various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages, 17 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Node Affinity Prediction in Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06940v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS - Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising, training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics. Our source code is available at https://github.com/orfeld415/NAVIS</p></details> | preprint |

Retrievalaugmented generation (RAG) methods aim to address this challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However, narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages and preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA and GutenQAdataset, showing substantial improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Video-STR: Reinforcing MLLMs in Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning with Relation Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10976v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset. Code, model, and data will be released.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce the Temporal Constraint-based Planning (TCP) benchmark that jointly assesses both capabilities. Each instance in TCP features a naturalistic dialogue around a collaborative project, where diverse and interdependent temporal constraints are explicitly or implicitly expressed, and models must infer an optimal schedule that satisfies all constraints. To construct TCP, we generate abstract problem prototypes that are then paired with realistic scenarios from various domains and enriched into dialogues using an LLM. A human quality check is performed on a sampled subset to confirm the reliability of our benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and find that even the strongest models may struggle with TCP, highlighting its difficulty and revealing limitations in LLMs' temporal constraint-based planning abilities. We analyze underlying failure cases, open source our benchmark, and hope our findings can inspire future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 main conference</p></details> |
| **[Self-Exploring Language Models for Explainable Link Forecasting on Temporal Graphs via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00975v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning, requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones. Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs. ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 15 figures.

Such BVPs are known to be numerically difficult to solve by traditional shooting methods due to extremely high sensitivity to initial guesses. In the light of recent successes in applying PINNs for solving high-dimensional differential equations, we develop a PINN to solve the problem of finding trajectories with minimum exposure to a spatiotemporal threat for a vehicle kinematic model. First, we implement PINNs that are trained to solve the BVP for a given pair of initial and final states for a given threat field. Next, we implement a PINN conditioned on the initial state for a given threat field, which eliminates the need for retraining for each initial state. We demonstrate that the PINN outputs satisfy the necessary conditions with low numerical error.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 Indian Control Conference</p></details> |

Learning travel semantics effectively and efficiently is crucial for real-world applications of trajectory data, which is hindered by two major challenges. First, travel purposes are tied to the functions of the roads and points-of-interest (POIs) involved in a trip. Such information is encoded in textual addresses and descriptions and introduces heavy computational burden to modeling. Second, real-world trajectories often contain redundant points, which harm both computational efficiency and trajectory embedding quality. To address these challenges, we propose TrajMamba, a novel approach for efficient and semantically rich vehicle trajectory learning. TrajMamba introduces a Traj-Mamba Encoder that captures movement patterns by jointly modeling both GPS and road perspectives of trajectories, enabling robust representations of continuous travel behaviors. It also incorporates a Travel Purpose-aware Pre-training procedure to integrate travel purposes into the learned embeddings without introducing extra overhead to embedding calculation. To reduce redundancy in trajectories, TrajMamba features a Knowledge Distillation Pre-training scheme to identify key trajectory points through a learnable mask generator and obtain effective compressed trajectory embeddings. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks show that TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2025</p></details> |
| **[Distributed Spatial-Temporal Trajectory Optimization for Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle Swarm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17541v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Swarm trajectory optimization problems are a well-recognized class of multi-agent optimal control problems with strong nonlinearity. However, the heuristic nature of needing to set the final time for agents beforehand and the time-consuming limitation of the significant number of iterations prohibit the application of existing methods to large-scale swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in practice. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal trajectory optimization framework that accomplishes multi-UAV consensus based on the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) and uses Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) for fast local planning of individual UAVs. The introduced framework is a two-level architecture that employs Parameterized DDP (PDDP) as the trajectory optimizer for each UAV, and ADMM to satisfy the local constraints and accomplish the spatial-temporal parameter consensus among all UAVs. This results in a fully distributed algorithm called Distributed Parameterized DDP (D-PDDP). In addition, an adaptive tuning criterion based on the spectral gradient method for the penalty parameter is proposed to reduce the number of algorithmic iterations. Several simulation examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

| **[KG-TRACES: Enhancing Large Language Models with Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning and Attribution Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00783v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various natural language processing tasks, but their performance on complex reasoning problems remains hindered by a lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/KG-TRACES.</p></details> | 24 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Continuous Dynamic Modeling via Neural ODEs for Popularity Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18742v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popularity prediction for information cascades has significant applications across various domains, including opinion monitoring and advertising recommendations. While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we address the challenge of identifying spurious executions of plans specified as a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula, as incorrect task sequences, violations of spatial constraints, timing inconsis- tencies, or deviations from intended mission semantics. To tackle this, we introduce a structured data generation framework based on the Nets-within-Nets (NWN) paradigm, which coordinates robot actions with LTL-derived global mission specifications. We further propose a Transformer-based anomaly detection pipeline that classifies robot trajectories as normal or anomalous. Experi- mental evaluations show that our method achieves high accuracy (91.3%) in identifying execution inefficiencies, and demonstrates robust detection capabilities for core mission violations (88.3%) and constraint-based adaptive anomalies (66.8%). An ablation experiment of the embedding and architecture was carried out, obtaining successful results where our novel proposition performs better than simpler representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages,3 figures, Iberian Robotics Conference 2025</p></details> |

We utilize the conventional scorers and the novel VLM-enhanced scorers. And we leverage a robust weight fusioner for quantitative aggregation and a powerful VLM-based fusioner for qualitative, context-aware decision-making. As the leading approach in the ICCV 2025 NAVSIM v2 End-to-End Driving Challenge, our SimpleVSF framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior balance between safety, comfort, and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Trajectory samplers rely on control input samplers, which generate control inputs u from a distribution p(u | x) where x is the current state. We introduce the notion of Free Configuration Space Uniformity (C-Free-Uniform for short) which has two key features: (i) it generates a control input distribution so as to uniformly sample the free configuration space, and (ii) in contrast to previously introduced trajectory sampling mechanisms where the distribution p(u | x) is independent of the environment, C-Free-Uniform is explicitly conditioned on the current local map. Next, we integrate this sampler into a new Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) Controller, CFU-MPPI.

Distinct from conventional action recognition and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization, video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword, scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies.

| **[Conformal Prediction in The Loop: A Feedback-Based Uncertainty Model for Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16376v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal Prediction (CP) is a powerful statistical machine learning tool to construct uncertainty sets with coverage guarantees, which has fueled its extensive adoption in generating prediction regions for decision-making tasks, e.g., Trajectory Optimization (TO) in uncertain environments. However, existing methods predominantly employ a sequential scheme, where decisions rely unidirectionally on the prediction regions, and consequently the information from decision-making fails to be fed back to instruct CP. In this paper, we propose a novel Feedback-Based CP (Fb-CP) framework for shrinking-horizon TO with a joint risk constraint over the entire mission time. Specifically, a CP-based posterior risk calculation method is developed by fully leveraging the realized trajectories to adjust the posterior allowable risk, which is then allocated to future times to update prediction regions. In this way, the information in the realized trajectories is continuously fed back to the CP, enabling attractive feedback-based adjustments of the prediction regions and a provable online improvement in trajectory performance. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that such adjustments consistently maintain the coverage guarantees of the prediction regions, thereby ensuring provable safety. Additionally, we develop a decision-focused iterative risk allocation algorithm with theoretical convergence analysis for allocating the posterior allowable risk which closely aligns with Fb-CP. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to handle distribution shift. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are demonstrated through benchmark experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Main Track</p></details> |
| **[SPOT: Sensing-augmented Trajectory Planning via Obstacle Threat Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16308v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>UAVs equipped with a single depth camera encounter significant challenges in dynamic obstacle avoidance due to limited field of view and inevitable blind spots. While active vision strategies that steer onboard cameras have been proposed to expand sensing coverage, most existing methods separate motion planning from sensing considerations, resulting in less effective and delayed obstacle response. To address this limitation, we introduce SPOT (Sensing-augmented Planning via Obstacle Threat modeling), a unified planning framework for observation-aware trajectory planning that explicitly incorporates sensing objectives into motion optimization. At the core of our method is a Gaussian Process-based obstacle belief map, which establishes a unified probabilistic representation of both recognized (previously observed) and potential obstacles. This belief is further processed through a collision-aware inference mechanism that transforms spatial uncertainty and trajectory proximity into a time-varying observation urgency map. By integrating urgency values within the current field of view, we define differentiable objectives that enable real-time, observation-aware trajectory planning with computation times under 10 ms. Simulation and real-world experiments in dynamic, cluttered, and occluded environments show that our method detects potential dynamic obstacles 2.8 seconds earlier than baseline approaches, increasing dynamic obstacle visibility by over 500\%, and enabling safe navigation through cluttered, occluded environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[AC Dynamics-aware Trajectory Optimization with Binary Enforcement for Adaptive UFLS Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16297v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high penetration of distributed energy resources, resulting in backfeed of power at the transmission and distribution interface, is causing conventional underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) schemes to become nonconforming. Adaptive schemes that update UFLS relay settings recursively in time offer a solution, but existing adaptive techniques that obtain UFLS relay settings with linearized or reduced-order model formulations fail to capture AC nonlinear network behavior. In practice, this will result in relays unable to restore system frequency during adverse disturbances. We formulate an adaptive UFLS problem as a trajectory optimization and include the full AC nonlinear network dynamics to ensure AC feasibility and time-coordinated control actions. We include binary decisions to model relay switching action and time-delayed multi-stage load-shedding. However, this formulation results in an intractable MINLP problem. To enforce model tractability, we relax these binary variables into continuous surrogates and reformulate the MINLP as a sequence of NLPs. We solve the NLPs with a homotopy-driven method that enforces near-integer-feasible solutions. We evaluate the framework on multiple synthetic transmission systems and demonstrate that it scales efficiently to networks exceeding 1500+ nodes with over 170k+ continuous and 73k+ binary decision variables, while successfully recovering binary-feasible solutions that arrest the frequency decline during worst-case disturbance.</p></details> |  |

These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs. LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued evolution of large-scale materials datasets.

| **[Pseudo-Kinematic Trajectory Control and Planning of Tracked Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18641v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracked vehicles distribute their weight continuously over a large surface area (the tracks). This distinctive feature makes them the preferred choice for vehicles required to traverse soft and uneven terrain. From a robotics perspective, however, this flexibility comes at a cost: the complexity of modelling the system and the resulting difficulty in designing theoretically sound navigation solutions. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing a framework for the navigation of tracked vehicles, built upon three key pillars. The first pillar comprises two models: a simulation model and a control-oriented model. The simulation model captures the intricate terramechanics dynamics arising from soil-track interaction and is employed to develop faithful digital twins of the system across a wide range of operating conditions. The control-oriented model is pseudo-kinematic and mathematically tractable, enabling the design of efficient and theoretically robust control schemes. The second pillar is a Lyapunov-based feedback trajectory controller that provides certifiable tracking guarantees. The third pillar is a portfolio of motion planning solutions, each offering different complexity-accuracy trade-offs.

Our approach leverages temporal graph networks for learning task-agnostic temporal sequencing and Gaussian Processes for spatial trajectory modeling, ensuring modularity and generalization across various tasks. By decoupling temporal and spatial aspects, DDACE requires only a small number of demonstrations, significantly reducing data requirements compared to traditional learning from demonstration approaches. To validate our proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments in task environments designed to assess various aspects of multi-robot coordination-such as multi-sequence execution, multi-action dynamics, complex trajectory generation, and heterogeneous configurations. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully achieves task execution under few-shot learning conditions and generalizes effectively across dynamic and diverse settings. This work underscores the potential of modular architectures in enhancing the practicality and scalability of multi-robot systems in real-world applications.

This study presents a Transformer-based framework for predicting the disease risk at the terminal locations of migratory bird trajectories. We integrate multi-source datasets, including GPS tracking data from Movebank, outbreak records from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), and geospatial context from GADM and Natural Earth. The raw coordinates are processed using H3 hierarchical geospatial encoding to capture spatial patterns. The model learns spatiotemporal dependencies from bird movement sequences to estimate endpoint disease risk. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.9821, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9803, average precision (AP) of 0.9299, and an F1-score of 0.8836 at the optimal threshold. These results highlight the potential of Transformer architectures to support early-warning systems for avian disease surveillance, enabling timely intervention and prevention strategies.</p></details> |  |

Prior work shows that adding localized text control signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings, offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles, pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion. Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with prior approaches.

State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent (SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients, slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates, specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients, accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets, yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

Most modern trajectory planning techniques rely on numerical optimization because high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy constraints can be systematically computed. However, strict requirements on computation time and the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical situations. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework called STITCHER that leverages graph search to generate long-range trajectories by stitching short trajectory segments together in real time. STITCHER is shown to outperform modern optimization-based planners through its innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Simulation results show safe trajectories through complex environments can be generated in milliseconds that cover tens of meters.</p></details> |  |

Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are available at https://www.gabriel.fiastre.fr/maskcaptioner/.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Modern trajectory planning techniques primarily use numerical optimization, as they enable the systematic computation of high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints. However, stringent requirements on computation time and the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework called STITCHER that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long-range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. STITCHER outperforms modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is performed to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, along with a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners. Simulation tests show that safe trajectories can be created within a few milliseconds for paths that span the entirety of two 50 m x 50 m environments. Hardware tests with a custom quadrotor verify that STITCHER can produce trackable paths in real-time while respecting nonconvex constraints, such as limits on tilt angle and motor forces, which are otherwise hard to include in optimization-based planners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Environment Perception and Route Choice Modeling for Trajectory Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14819v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight: treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit \textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions. Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5 downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj. Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PRTraj.</p></details> |  |

Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA, an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trace Anything: Representing Any Video in 4D via Trajectory Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13802v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling, understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video, the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

| **[CAMNet: Leveraging Cooperative Awareness Messages for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12703v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network, Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC) 2026 - Las Vegas, NV, USA 9 - 12 January 2026</p></details> |
| **[Few Shot Semi-Supervised Learning for Abnormal Stop Detection from Sparse GPS Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12686v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach transportation is critical for ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory compliance. However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density. Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854 and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods. The code and dataset are publicly available at \href{https://github.com/pangjunbiao/Abnormal-Stop-Detection-SSL.git}</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion: Fast Generation with Interpretable Diffusion Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12220v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories. Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image synthesis in generative modeling.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs' zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction, behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output. This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by The 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Generative and Agentic AI for Multi-Modality Space-Time Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning with Generative Trajectory Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11499v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex, multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow, iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue, lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Building upon grasp-matrix formulations and internal force redundancy, we propose a feedback wrench controller that actively regulates the payload's pose while an optimization layer dynamically shapes internal-force oscillations to guarantee persistent carrier motion. Preliminary experimental results on multirotor UAVs validate the model assumptions, and numerical simulations demonstrate that the method successfully prevents carrier stagnation, achieves accurate load tracking, and generates physically feasible trajectories with smooth velocity profiles. The proposed framework not only advances the state of the art but also offers a reliable, versatile solution for future real-world applications requiring load transportation by coordinated non-stopping flying carriers.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving practical RPF remains challenging due to frequent occlusions, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments. Existing approaches often rely on fixed-point following or sparse candidate-point selection with oversimplified heuristics, which cannot adequately handle complex occlusions caused by moving obstacles such as pedestrians. To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive trajectory sampling method that generates dense candidate points within socially aware zones and evaluates them using a multi-objective cost function. Based on the optimal point, a person-following trajectory is estimated relative to the predicted motion of the target. We further design a prediction-aware model predictive path integral (MPPI) controller that simultaneously tracks this trajectory and proactively avoids collisions using predicted pedestrian motions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in smoothness, safety, robustness, and human comfort, with its effectiveness further demonstrated on a mobile robot in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://adap-rpf.github.io/</p></details> |

While these approaches have shown promise, they often operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds. Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene, then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories. Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

State-of-the-art models have achieved remarkable accuracy in such prediction tasks. Besides accuracy, diversity is also crucial for safe planning because human behaviors are inherently uncertain and multimodal. However, existing methods generally lack a scheme to generate controllably diverse trajectories, which is arguably more useful than randomly diversified trajectories, to the end of safe planning. To address this, we propose PrefCVAE, an augmented CVAE framework that uses weakly labeled preference pairs to imbue latent variables with semantic attributes. Using average velocity as an example attribute, we demonstrate that PrefCVAE enables controllable, semantically meaningful predictions without degrading baseline accuracy. Our results show the effectiveness of preference supervision as a cost-effective way to enhance sampling-based generative models.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents' summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 GenAI4Health Workshop</p></details> |

This study conducts a comprehensive scientometric analysis of research on data-driven pedestrian trajectory prediction and crowd simulation, mapping its intellectual evolution and interdisciplinary structure. Using bibliometric data from the Web of Science Core Collection, we employ SciExplorer and Bibliometrix to identify major trends, influential contributors, and emerging frontiers. Results reveal a strong convergence between artificial intelligence, urban informatics, and crowd behavior modeling--driven by graph neural networks, transformers, and generative models. Beyond technical advances, the field increasingly informs urban mobility design, public safety planning, and digital twin development for smart cities. However, challenges remain in ensuring interpretability, inclusivity, and cross-domain transferability. By connecting methodological trajectories with urban applications, this work highlights how data-driven approaches can enrich urban governance and pave the way for adaptive, socially responsible mobility intelligence in future cities.</p></details> | 5 figures |

This significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains, ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid, it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments through more effective utilization of past experiences.</p></details> |  |

Accurately modeling such behavior remains challenging due to the complexity of pairwise spatial-temporal interactions and the heterogeneous influence of groupwise dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. Hyper-STTN constructs multiscale hypergraphs of varying group sizes to model groupwise correlations, captured through spectral hypergraph convolution based on random-walk probabilities. In parallel, a spatial-temporal transformer is employed to learn pedestrians' pairwise latent interactions across spatial and temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous groupwise and pairwise features are subsequently fused and aligned via a multimodal transformer. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian motion datasets demonstrate that Hyper-STTN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque, non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRAJECT-Bench:A Trajectory-Aware Benchmark for Evaluating Agentic Tool Use](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04550v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based agents increasingly rely on tool use to complete real-world tasks. While existing works evaluate the LLMs' tool use capability, they largely focus on the final answers yet overlook the detailed tool usage trajectory, i.e., whether tools are selected, parameterized, and ordered correctly. We introduce TRAJECT-Bench, a trajectory-aware benchmark to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' tool use capability through diverse tasks with fine-grained evaluation metrics. TRAJECT-Bench pairs high-fidelity, executable tools across practical domains with tasks grounded in production-style APIs, and synthesizes trajectories that vary in breadth (parallel calls) and depth (interdependent chains). Besides final accuracy, TRAJECT-Bench also reports trajectory-level diagnostics, including tool selection and argument correctness, and dependency/order satisfaction. Analyses reveal failure modes such as similar tool confusion and parameter-blind selection, and scaling behavior with tool diversity and trajectory length where the bottleneck of transiting from short to mid-length trajectories is revealed, offering actionable guidance for LLMs' tool use.</p></details> |  |

Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves 81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task, outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the MICCAI 2025 Learning with Longitudinal Medical Images and Data Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Flow-Opt: Scalable Centralized Multi-Robot Trajectory Optimization with Flow Matching and Differentiable Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09204v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Centralized trajectory optimization in the joint space of multiple robots allows access to a larger feasible space that can result in smoother trajectories, especially while planning in tight spaces. Unfortunately, it is often computationally intractable beyond a very small swarm size. In this paper, we propose Flow-Opt, a learning-based approach towards improving the computational tractability of centralized multi-robot trajectory optimization. Specifically, we reduce the problem to first learning a generative model to sample different candidate trajectories and then using a learned Safety-Filter(SF) to ensure fast inference-time constraint satisfaction. We propose a flow-matching model with a diffusion transformer (DiT) augmented with permutation invariant robot position and map encoders as the generative model. We develop a custom solver for our SF and equip it with a neural network that predicts context-specific initialization. The initialization network is trained in a self-supervised manner, taking advantage of the differentiability of the SF solver. We advance the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that we can generate trajectories of tens of robots in cluttered environments in a few tens of milliseconds. This is several times faster than existing centralized optimization approaches. Moreover, our approach also generates smoother trajectories orders of magnitude faster than competing baselines based on diffusion models. Second, each component of our approach can be batched, allowing us to solve a few tens of problem instances in a fraction of a second. We believe this is a first such result; no existing approach provides such capabilities. Finally, our approach can generate a diverse set of trajectories between a given set of start and goal locations, which can capture different collision-avoidance behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[ResAD: Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08562v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  |

FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues, enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning, drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible action control and mesh animations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://bestzzhang.github.io/FlexTraj</p></details> |

Existing methods rely on paired datasets or hand-crafted rewards, which limit scalability and generalization. We propose TrajSkill, a framework for Trajectory Conditioned Cross-embodiment Skill Transfer, enabling robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from human demonstration videos. Our key insight is to represent human motions as sparse optical flow trajectories, which serve as embodiment-agnostic motion cues by removing morphological variations while preserving essential dynamics. Conditioned on these trajectories together with visual and textual inputs, TrajSkill jointly synthesizes temporally consistent robot manipulation videos and translates them into executable actions, thereby achieving cross-embodiment skill transfer. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results on simulation data (MetaWorld) show that TrajSkill reduces FVD by 39.6\% and KVD by 36.6\% compared with the state-of-the-art, and improves cross-embodiment success rate by up to 16.7\%. Real-robot experiments in kitchen manipulation tasks further validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating practical human-to-robot skill transfer across embodiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoGen: A Two-stage Coarse-to-Fine Framework for Fine-grained Synthetic Location-based Social Network Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07735v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important for many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and pandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data. The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation. In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[GATO: GPU-Accelerated and Batched Trajectory Optimization for Scalable Edge Model Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07625v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Model Predictive Control (MPC) delivers strong performance across robotics applications, solving the underlying (batches of) nonlinear trajectory optimization (TO) problems online remains computationally demanding. Existing GPU-accelerated approaches typically (i) parallelize a single solve to meet real-time deadlines, (ii) scale to very large batches at slower-than-real-time rates, or (iii) achieve speed by restricting model generality (e.g., point-mass dynamics or a single linearization). This leaves a large gap in solver performance for many state-of-the-art MPC applications that require real-time batches of tens to low-hundreds of solves. As such, we present GATO, an open source, GPU-accelerated, batched TO solver co-designed across algorithm, software, and computational hardware to deliver real-time throughput for these moderate batch size regimes. Our approach leverages a combination of block-, warp-, and thread-level parallelism within and across solves for ultra-high performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a combination of: simulated benchmarks showing speedups of 18-21x over CPU baselines and 1.4-16x over GPU baselines as batch size increases; case studies highlighting improved disturbance rejection and convergence behavior; and finally a validation on hardware using an industrial manipulator. We open source GATO to support reproducibility and adoption.</p></details> |  |

This research establishes a comprehensive, mathematically rigorous framework for trajectory prediction that moves beyond empirical modeling to a geomechanically-informed, data-driven surrogate approach.The study leverages Log ASCII Standard (LAS) and wellbore deviation (DEV) data from 14 wells in the Gulfaks oil field, treating petrophysical logs not merely as input features, but as proxies for the mechanical properties of the rock that fundamentally govern drilling dynamics. A key contribution of this work is the formal derivation of wellbore kinematic models, including the Average Angle method and Dogleg Severity, from the first principles of vector calculus and differential geometry, contextualizing them as robust numerical integration schemes. The core of the predictive model is a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network, for which we provide a complete, step-by-step derivation of the forward propagation dynamics and the Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) training algorithm. This detailed theoretical exposition, often omitted in applied studies, clarifies the mechanisms by which the network learns temporal dependencies. The methodology encompasses a theoretically justified data preprocessing pipeline, including feature normalization, uniform depth resampling, and sequence generation. Trajectory post-processing and error analysis are conducted using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the Coefficient of Determination (R2).</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing approaches face critical limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for efficient deep search systems.

| **[Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy for Long-horizon Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10040v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have advanced robot imitation learning, but high data collection costs and limited demonstrations hinder generalization and current imitation learning methods struggle in out-of-distribution scenarios, especially for long-horizon tasks. A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)</p></details> |
| **[Diffusing Trajectory Optimization Problems for Recovery During Multi-Finger Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07030v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-fingered hands are emerging as powerful platforms for performing fine manipulation tasks, including tool use. However, environmental perturbations or execution errors can impede task performance, motivating the use of recovery behaviors that enable normal task execution to resume. In this work, we take advantage of recent advances in diffusion models to construct a framework that autonomously identifies when recovery is necessary and optimizes contact-rich trajectories to recover. We use a diffusion model trained on the task to estimate when states are not conducive to task execution, framed as an out-of-distribution detection problem. We then use diffusion sampling to project these states in-distribution and use trajectory optimization to plan contact-rich recovery trajectories. We also propose a novel diffusion-based approach that distills this process to efficiently diffuse the full parameterization, including constraints, goal state, and initialization, of the recovery trajectory optimization problem, saving time during online execution. We compare our method to a reinforcement learning baseline and other methods that do not explicitly plan contact interactions, including on a hardware screwdriver-turning task where we show that recovering using our method improves task performance by 96% and that ours is the only method evaluated that can attempt recovery without causing catastrophic task failure.

These agents operate by autonomously generating natural language thoughts, invoking external tools, and iteratively refining their solutions. Despite their widespread adoption, the internal decision-making processes of these agents remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of their operational dynamics and failure modes. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of the thought-action-result trajectories of three state-of-the-art LLM-based agents: RepairAgent, AutoCodeRover, and OpenHands. We unify their interaction logs into a common format, capturing 120 trajectories and 2,822 LLM interactions focused on program repair and issue resolution. Our study combines quantitative analyses of structural properties, action patterns, and token usage with qualitative assessments of reasoning coherence and feedback integration. We identify key trajectory characteristics, such as iteration counts and token consumption, recurring action sequences, and the semantic coherence of thoughts, actions, and their results. Our findings reveal behavioral motifs and anti-patterns that distinguish successful from failed executions, providing actionable insights for improving agent design, including prompting strategies, failure diagnosis, and anti-pattern detection. We release our dataset and annotation framework to support further research on transparent and robust autonomous software engineering agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACCEP...</summary><p>ACCEPTED FOR ASE 2025</p></details> |

We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further reference.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Longitudinal Flow Matching for Trajectory Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03569v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models for sequential data often struggle with sparsely sampled and high-dimensional trajectories, typically reducing the learning of dynamics to pairwise transitions. We propose Interpolative Multi-Marginal Flow Matching (IMMFM), a framework that learns continuous stochastic dynamics jointly consistent with multiple observed time points. IMMFM employs a piecewise-quadratic interpolation path as a smooth target for flow matching and jointly optimizes drift and a data-driven diffusion coefficient, supported by a theoretical condition for stable learning. This design captures intrinsic stochasticity, handles irregular sparse sampling, and yields subject-specific trajectories. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world longitudinal neuroimaging datasets show that IMMFM outperforms existing methods in both forecasting accuracy and further downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally Smooth Mesh Extraction for Procedural Scenes with Long-Range Camera Trajectories using Spacetime Octrees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13306v3)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The procedural occupancy function is a flexible and compact representation for creating 3D scenes. For rasterization and other tasks, it is often necessary to extract a mesh that represents the shape. Unbounded scenes with long-range camera trajectories, such as flying through a forest, pose a unique challenge for mesh extraction. A single static mesh representing all the geometric detail necessary for the full camera path can be prohibitively large. Therefore, independent meshes can be extracted for different camera views, but this approach may lead to popping artifacts during transitions. We propose a temporally coherent method for extracting meshes suitable for long-range camera trajectories in unbounded scenes represented by an occupancy function. The key idea is to perform 4D mesh extraction using a new spacetime tree structure called a binary-octree. Experiments show that, compared to existing baseline methods, our method offers superior visual consistency at a comparable cost.

| **[Nearly Instance-Optimal Parameter Recovery from Many Trajectories via Hellinger Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06434v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from temporally-correlated data is a core facet of modern machine learning. Yet our understanding of sequential learning remains incomplete, particularly in the multi-trajectory setting where data consists of many independent realizations of a time-indexed stochastic process. This important regime both reflects modern training pipelines such as for large foundation models, and offers the potential for learning without the typical mixing assumptions made in the single-trajectory case. However, instance-optimal bounds are known only for least-squares regression with dependent covariates; for more general models or loss functions, the only broadly applicable guarantees result from a reduction to either i.i.d. learning, with effective sample size scaling only in the number of trajectories, or an existing single-trajectory result when each individual trajectory mixes, with effective sample size scaling as the full data budget deflated by the mixing-time. In this work, we significantly broaden the scope of instance-optimal rates in multi-trajectory settings via the Hellinger localization framework, a general approach for maximum likelihood estimation. Our method proceeds by first controlling the squared Hellinger distance at the path-measure level via a reduction to i.i.d. learning, followed by localization as a quadratic form in parameter space weighted by the trajectory Fisher information. This yields instance-optimal bounds that scale with the full data budget under a broad set of conditions. We instantiate our framework across four diverse case studies: a simple mixture of Markov chains, dependent linear regression under non-Gaussian noise, generalized linear models with non-monotonic activations, and linear-attention sequence models. In all cases, our bounds nearly match the instance-optimal rates from asymptotic normality, substantially improving over standard reductions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Off-Trajectory Reasoning: Can LLMs Collaborate on Reasoning Trajectory?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06410v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning LLMs are trained to verbalize their reasoning process, yielding strong gains on complex tasks. This transparency also opens a promising direction: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking within a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and exploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the usefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this off-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can standard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory behaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the off-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can backtrack from "distractions" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and Guidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from stronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and reveals a counterintuitive finding -- "stronger" LLMs on benchmarks are often more fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively leverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent capabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control studies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these behaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data selection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training natively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal recoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled students even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together, this work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in shared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf reasoning LLMs.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multimodal Trajectory Representation Learning for Travel Time Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05840v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches typically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting the inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to information loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE accuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics, while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong generalization abilities.

| **[Traj-Transformer: Diffusion Models with Transformer for GPS Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06291v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of GPS devices has driven advances in spatiotemporal data mining, enabling machine learning models to simulate human decision making and generate realistic trajectories, addressing both data collection costs and privacy concerns. Recent studies have shown the promise of diffusion models for high-quality trajectory generation. However, most existing methods rely on convolution based architectures (e.g. UNet) to predict noise during the diffusion process, which often results in notable deviations and the loss of fine-grained street-level details due to limited model capacity. In this paper, we propose Trajectory Transformer, a novel model that employs a transformer backbone for both conditional information embedding and noise prediction. We explore two GPS coordinate embedding strategies, location embedding and longitude-latitude embedding, and analyze model performance at different scales. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Trajectory Transformer significantly enhances generation quality and effectively alleviates the deviation issues observed in prior approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentRewardBench: Evaluating Automatic Evaluations of Web Agent Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08942v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web agents enable users to perform tasks on web browsers through natural language interaction. Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations. We release the benchmark at: https://agent-reward-bench.github.io</p></details> |  |

The proposed filter, the trajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the set of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the set of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated with the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM posterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM density on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution for multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating the set of target states at the end of each time window. Additionally, the paper proposes computationally lighter alternatives to the TM-PMBM filter by deriving a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) density through Kullback-Leibler divergence minimisation in an augmented space with auxiliary variables.

| **[RareGraph-Synth: Knowledge-Guided Diffusion Models for Generating Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Patient Trajectories in Ultra-Rare Diseases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06267v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose RareGraph-Synth, a knowledge-guided, continuous-time diffusion framework that generates realistic yet privacy-preserving synthetic electronic-health-record (EHR) trajectories for ultra-rare diseases. RareGraph-Synth unifies five public resources: Orphanet/Orphadata, the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), the GARD rare-disease KG, PrimeKG, and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) into a heterogeneous knowledge graph comprising approximately 8 M typed edges. Meta-path scores extracted from this 8-million-edge KG modulate the per-token noise schedule in the forward stochastic differential equation, steering generation toward biologically plausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining score-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces timestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag triples that contain no protected health information. On simulated ultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean Discrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by greater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream predictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the DOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55 safe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61 plus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong resistance to re-identification. These results suggest that integrating biomedical knowledge graphs directly into diffusion noise schedules can simultaneously enhance fidelity and privacy, enabling safer data sharing for rare-disease research.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables.

| **[PAD-TRO: Projection-Augmented Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04436v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have gained popularity and attention in trajectory optimization due to their capability of modeling multi-modal probability distributions. However, addressing nonlinear equality constraints, i.e, dynamic feasi- bility, remains a great challenge in diffusion-based trajectory optimization. Recent diffusion-based trajectory optimization frameworks rely on a single-shooting style approach where the denoised control sequence is applied to forward propagate the dynamical system, which cannot explicitly enforce constraints on the states and frequently leads to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we propose a novel direct trajectory optimization approach via model-based diffusion, which directly generates a sequence of states. To ensure dynamic feasibility, we propose a gradient-free projection mechanism that is incorporated into the reverse diffusion process. Our results show that, compared to a recent state-of-the-art baseline, our approach leads to zero dynamic feasibility error and approximately 4x higher success rate in a quadrotor waypoint navigation scenario involving dense static obstacles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion^2: Dual Diffusion Model with Uncertainty-Aware Adaptive Noise for Momentary Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04365v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency in autonomous driving and human-robot interaction scenarios. Earlier studies primarily utilized sufficient observational data to predict future trajectories. However, in real-world scenarios, such as pedestrians suddenly emerging from blind spots, sufficient observational data is often unavailable (i.e. momentary trajectory), making accurate prediction challenging and increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Therefore, advancing research on pedestrian trajectory prediction under extreme scenarios is critical for enhancing traffic safety. In this work, we propose a novel framework termed Diffusion^2, tailored for momentary trajectory prediction. Diffusion^2 consists of two sequentially connected diffusion models: one for backward prediction, which generates unobserved historical trajectories, and the other for forward prediction, which forecasts future trajectories. Given that the generated unobserved historical trajectories may introduce additional noise, we propose a dual-head parameterization mechanism to estimate their aleatoric uncertainty and design a temporally adaptive noise module that dynamically modulates the noise scale in the forward diffusion process. Empirically, Diffusion^2 sets a new state-of-the-art in momentary trajectory prediction on ETH/UCY and Stanford Drone datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[NoTVLA: Narrowing of Dense Action Trajectories for Generalizable Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03895v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a pivotal advance in embodied intelligence, yet they confront critical barriers to real-world deployment, most notably catastrophic forgetting. This issue stems from their overreliance on continuous action sequences or action chunks, which inadvertently create isolated data silos that disrupt knowledge retention across tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA) framework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories, thereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory fine-tuning. A key innovation of NoTVLA lies in its trajectory planning strategy: instead of centering on the target object's trajectory, it leverages temporal compression and spatial reasoning pruning specifically for the robot end effector's trajectory. Furthermore, training is conducted using these sparse trajectories rather than dense action trajectories, an optimization that delivers remarkable practical advantages with better performance in zero-shot. In multi-task evaluation scenarios, NoTVLA achieves superior performance and generalization compared to pi0 while operating under two critical constraints: it uses over an order of magnitude less computing power than pi0 and requires no wrist-mounted camera. This design ensures that NoTVLA's operational accuracy closely approximates that of single-task expert models. Crucially, it also preserves the model's inherent language capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization in specific scenarios, supporting unified model deployment across multiple robot platforms, and fostering a degree of generalization even when perceiving tasks from novel perspectives.</p></details> |  |

The dynamics of those agents strongly depends on their tasks, roles, or observable labels. Class-conditioned motion prediction is thus an appealing way to reduce forecast uncertainty and get more accurate predictions for heterogeneous agents. However, this is hardly explored in the prior art, especially for mobile robots and in limited data applications. In this paper, we analyse different class-conditioned trajectory prediction methods on two datasets. We propose a set of conditional pattern-based and efficient deep learning-based baselines, and evaluate their performance on robotics and outdoors datasets (TH\"OR-MAGNI and Stanford Drone Dataset). Our experiments show that all methods improve accuracy in most of the settings when considering class labels. More importantly, we observe that there are significant differences when learning from imbalanced datasets, or in new environments where sufficient data is not available. In particular, we find that deep learning methods perform better on balanced datasets, but in applications with limited data, e.g., cold start of a robot in a new environment, or imbalanced classes, pattern-based methods may be preferable.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters journal and presented at the 40th Anniversary of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, which was held in Rotterdam, Netherlands on 23-26 September, 2024</p></details> |

We present Dynamic Neural Potential Field (NPField-GPT), a learning-enhanced model predictive control (MPC) framework that couples classical optimization with a Transformer-based predictor of footprint-aware repulsive potentials. Given an occupancy sub-map, robot footprint, and optional dynamic-obstacle cues, our autoregressive NPField-GPT head forecasts a horizon of differentiable potentials that are injected into a sequential quadratic MPC program via L4CasADi, yielding real-time, constraint-aware trajectory optimization. We additionally study two baselines: (NPField-D1) static-frame decomposition and (NPField-D2) parallel MLP heads for all steps. In dynamic indoor scenarios from BenchMR and on a Husky UGV in office corridors, NPField-GPT produces safer, more conservative trajectories under motion changes, while D1/D2 offer lower latency. We also compare with the CIAO* and MPPI baselines. Across methods, the Transformer+MPC synergy preserves the transparency and stability of model-based planning while learning only the part that benefits from data: spatiotemporal collision risk.

When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage is available at https://follow-your-shape.github.io/</p></details> |

Prior work established that statistically efficient learning is impossible for either of these problems when the only assumptions are that the data has good coverage (concentrability) and the state-action value function of every policy is linearly realizable ($q^\pi$-realizability) (Foster et al., 2021). Recently, Tkachuk et al. (2024) gave a statistically efficient learner for policy optimization, if in addition the data is assumed to be given as trajectories. In this work we present a statistically efficient learner for policy evaluation under the same assumptions. Further, we show that the sample complexity of the learner used by Tkachuk et al. (2024) for policy optimization can be improved by a tighter analysis.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose an optimal smooth coverage trajectory planning algorithm. The algorithm consists of two stages. In the front-end, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for Points of Interest (POIs), generating an initial sequence of optimized visiting points. In the back-end, the sequence is further optimized by considering trajectory smoothness, time consumption, and obstacle avoidance. This is formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem and solved to produce a smooth coverage trajectory that satisfies these constraints. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, ensuring UAVs can smoothly cover all POIs in cluttered environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the 44th Chinese Control Conference, 2025.

By combining individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse urban environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 2 algorithms, 1 table</p></details> |

However, existing methods often struggle to model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality, obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process. Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://reagan1311.github.io/mask2iv</p></details> |

However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication, the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$ on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in safeguarding sensitive data.</p></details> |  |

The importance of accurate real-time performance of the controller lies in safety considerations of situations where the dynamic system under control is affected by uncertainties and disturbances, and the controller should compensate for such phenomena in order to provide stable performance. A multiple-shooting nonlinear model-predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. This framework benefits from suitable algorithm along with readings from various sensors for genuine real-time performance with extremely high accuracy. The controller is then tested for tracking different trajectories where it demonstrates highly desirable performance in terms of both speed and accuracy. This controller shows remarkable improvement when compared to existing nonlinear model-predictive controllers in the literature that were implemented on skid-steered mobile platforms.</p></details> |  |

We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically, ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints, ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence.

However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity. The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation. Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning ($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of REACT-Drive.</p></details> | 13 pages,5 figures |

In this framework, each agent in a multi-agent system is assigned a partial trajectory offline and locally approximates the unknown dynamics using a deep neural network within the Koopman operator framework. By exchanging local estimated dynamics rather than training data, agents achieve consensus on a global dynamics model without sharing their private training trajectories. Simulation studies on a surface vehicle demonstrate that DDKL-PT attains consensus with respect to the learned dynamics, with each agent achieving reasonably small approximation errors over the testing data. Furthermore, a model predictive control scheme is developed by integrating the learned Koopman dynamics with known kinematic relations. Results on goal-tracking and station-keeping tasks support that the distributedly learned dynamics are sufficiently accurate for model-based optimal control.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Trajectory Generator for High-Density Traffic and Diverse Agent-Interaction Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02627v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is fundamental to autonomous driving, as it underpins safe motion planning and collision avoidance in complex environments. However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous road environments into a structured grid representation that supports fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety. Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Best Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18873v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful approach for aligning generative models, but its reliance on learned reward models makes it vulnerable to mis-specification and reward hacking. Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) offers a more robust alternative by directly leveraging noisy binary comparisons over trajectories. We study the best policy identification problem in PbRL, motivated by post-training optimization of generative models, for example, during multi-turn interactions. Learning in this setting combines an offline preference dataset--potentially biased or out-of-distribution and collected from a rater of subpar 'competence'--with online pure exploration, making systematic online learning essential. To this end, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling that maintains posteriors over the reward model and dynamics. We provide the first Bayesian simple regret guarantees for PbRL and introduce an efficient approximation that outperforms existing baselines on simulation and image generation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.</p></details> |  |

Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 15 figures.

Such BVPs are known to be numerically difficult to solve by traditional shooting methods due to extremely high sensitivity to initial guesses. In the light of recent successes in applying PINNs for solving high-dimensional differential equations, we develop a PINN to solve the problem of finding trajectories with minimum exposure to a spatiotemporal threat for a vehicle kinematic model. First, we implement PINNs that are trained to solve the BVP for a given pair of initial and final states for a given threat field. Next, we implement a PINN conditioned on the initial state for a given threat field, which eliminates the need for retraining for each initial state. We demonstrate that the PINN outputs satisfy the necessary conditions with low numerical error.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 Indian Control Conference</p></details> |

Learning travel semantics effectively and efficiently is crucial for real-world applications of trajectory data, which is hindered by two major challenges. First, travel purposes are tied to the functions of the roads and points-of-interest (POIs) involved in a trip. Such information is encoded in textual addresses and descriptions and introduces heavy computational burden to modeling. Second, real-world trajectories often contain redundant points, which harm both computational efficiency and trajectory embedding quality. To address these challenges, we propose TrajMamba, a novel approach for efficient and semantically rich vehicle trajectory learning. TrajMamba introduces a Traj-Mamba Encoder that captures movement patterns by jointly modeling both GPS and road perspectives of trajectories, enabling robust representations of continuous travel behaviors. It also incorporates a Travel Purpose-aware Pre-training procedure to integrate travel purposes into the learned embeddings without introducing extra overhead to embedding calculation. To reduce redundancy in trajectories, TrajMamba features a Knowledge Distillation Pre-training scheme to identify key trajectory points through a learnable mask generator and obtain effective compressed trajectory embeddings. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks show that TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2025</p></details> |

However, the heuristic nature of needing to set the final time for agents beforehand and the time-consuming limitation of the significant number of iterations prohibit the application of existing methods to large-scale swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in practice. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal trajectory optimization framework that accomplishes multi-UAV consensus based on the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) and uses Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) for fast local planning of individual UAVs. The introduced framework is a two-level architecture that employs Parameterized DDP (PDDP) as the trajectory optimizer for each UAV, and ADMM to satisfy the local constraints and accomplish the spatial-temporal parameter consensus among all UAVs. This results in a fully distributed algorithm called Distributed Parameterized DDP (D-PDDP). In addition, an adaptive tuning criterion based on the spectral gradient method for the penalty parameter is proposed to reduce the number of algorithmic iterations. Several simulation examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

| **[KG-TRACES: Enhancing Large Language Models with Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning and Attribution Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00783v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various natural language processing tasks, but their performance on complex reasoning problems remains hindered by a lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/KG-TRACES.</p></details> | 24 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Continuous Dynamic Modeling via Neural ODEs for Popularity Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18742v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popularity prediction for information cascades has significant applications across various domains, including opinion monitoring and advertising recommendations. While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we address the challenge of identifying spurious executions of plans specified as a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula, as incorrect task sequences, violations of spatial constraints, timing inconsis- tencies, or deviations from intended mission semantics. To tackle this, we introduce a structured data generation framework based on the Nets-within-Nets (NWN) paradigm, which coordinates robot actions with LTL-derived global mission specifications. We further propose a Transformer-based anomaly detection pipeline that classifies robot trajectories as normal or anomalous. Experi- mental evaluations show that our method achieves high accuracy (91.3%) in identifying execution inefficiencies, and demonstrates robust detection capabilities for core mission violations (88.3%) and constraint-based adaptive anomalies (66.8%). An ablation experiment of the embedding and architecture was carried out, obtaining successful results where our novel proposition performs better than simpler representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages,3 figures, Iberian Robotics Conference 2025</p></details> |

However, existing end-to-end methods still face significant challenges, such as suboptimal decision-making in complex scenarios. In this paper,we propose SimpleVSF (Simple VLM-Scoring Fusion), a novel framework that enhances end-to-end planning by leveraging the cognitive capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and advanced trajectory fusion techniques. We utilize the conventional scorers and the novel VLM-enhanced scorers. And we leverage a robust weight fusioner for quantitative aggregation and a powerful VLM-based fusioner for qualitative, context-aware decision-making. As the leading approach in the ICCV 2025 NAVSIM v2 End-to-End Driving Challenge, our SimpleVSF framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior balance between safety, comfort, and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Trajectory samplers rely on control input samplers, which generate control inputs u from a distribution p(u | x) where x is the current state. We introduce the notion of Free Configuration Space Uniformity (C-Free-Uniform for short) which has two key features: (i) it generates a control input distribution so as to uniformly sample the free configuration space, and (ii) in contrast to previously introduced trajectory sampling mechanisms where the distribution p(u | x) is independent of the environment, C-Free-Uniform is explicitly conditioned on the current local map. Next, we integrate this sampler into a new Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) Controller, CFU-MPPI. Experiments show that CFU-MPPI outperforms existing methods in terms of success rate in challenging navigation tasks in cluttered polygonal environments while requiring a much smaller sampling budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA). 8 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

Distinct from conventional action recognition and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization, video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword, scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies. Experiments show that RefAtomNet++ establishes new state-of-the-art results.

| **[Conformal Prediction in The Loop: A Feedback-Based Uncertainty Model for Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16376v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal Prediction (CP) is a powerful statistical machine learning tool to construct uncertainty sets with coverage guarantees, which has fueled its extensive adoption in generating prediction regions for decision-making tasks, e.g., Trajectory Optimization (TO) in uncertain environments. However, existing methods predominantly employ a sequential scheme, where decisions rely unidirectionally on the prediction regions, and consequently the information from decision-making fails to be fed back to instruct CP. In this paper, we propose a novel Feedback-Based CP (Fb-CP) framework for shrinking-horizon TO with a joint risk constraint over the entire mission time. Specifically, a CP-based posterior risk calculation method is developed by fully leveraging the realized trajectories to adjust the posterior allowable risk, which is then allocated to future times to update prediction regions. In this way, the information in the realized trajectories is continuously fed back to the CP, enabling attractive feedback-based adjustments of the prediction regions and a provable online improvement in trajectory performance. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that such adjustments consistently maintain the coverage guarantees of the prediction regions, thereby ensuring provable safety. Additionally, we develop a decision-focused iterative risk allocation algorithm with theoretical convergence analysis for allocating the posterior allowable risk which closely aligns with Fb-CP. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to handle distribution shift. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are demonstrated through benchmark experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Main Track</p></details> |
| **[SPOT: Sensing-augmented Trajectory Planning via Obstacle Threat Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16308v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>UAVs equipped with a single depth camera encounter significant challenges in dynamic obstacle avoidance due to limited field of view and inevitable blind spots. While active vision strategies that steer onboard cameras have been proposed to expand sensing coverage, most existing methods separate motion planning from sensing considerations, resulting in less effective and delayed obstacle response. To address this limitation, we introduce SPOT (Sensing-augmented Planning via Obstacle Threat modeling), a unified planning framework for observation-aware trajectory planning that explicitly incorporates sensing objectives into motion optimization. At the core of our method is a Gaussian Process-based obstacle belief map, which establishes a unified probabilistic representation of both recognized (previously observed) and potential obstacles. This belief is further processed through a collision-aware inference mechanism that transforms spatial uncertainty and trajectory proximity into a time-varying observation urgency map. By integrating urgency values within the current field of view, we define differentiable objectives that enable real-time, observation-aware trajectory planning with computation times under 10 ms. Simulation and real-world experiments in dynamic, cluttered, and occluded environments show that our method detects potential dynamic obstacles 2.8 seconds earlier than baseline approaches, increasing dynamic obstacle visibility by over 500\%, and enabling safe navigation through cluttered, occluded environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[AC Dynamics-aware Trajectory Optimization with Binary Enforcement for Adaptive UFLS Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16297v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high penetration of distributed energy resources, resulting in backfeed of power at the transmission and distribution interface, is causing conventional underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) schemes to become nonconforming. Adaptive schemes that update UFLS relay settings recursively in time offer a solution, but existing adaptive techniques that obtain UFLS relay settings with linearized or reduced-order model formulations fail to capture AC nonlinear network behavior. In practice, this will result in relays unable to restore system frequency during adverse disturbances. We formulate an adaptive UFLS problem as a trajectory optimization and include the full AC nonlinear network dynamics to ensure AC feasibility and time-coordinated control actions. We include binary decisions to model relay switching action and time-delayed multi-stage load-shedding. However, this formulation results in an intractable MINLP problem. To enforce model tractability, we relax these binary variables into continuous surrogates and reformulate the MINLP as a sequence of NLPs. We solve the NLPs with a homotopy-driven method that enforces near-integer-feasible solutions. We evaluate the framework on multiple synthetic transmission systems and demonstrate that it scales efficiently to networks exceeding 1500+ nodes with over 170k+ continuous and 73k+ binary decision variables, while successfully recovering binary-feasible solutions that arrest the frequency decline during worst-case disturbance.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeMat-Traj: A Scalable and Unified Dataset of Materials Trajectories for Atomistic Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20875v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs. LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LeMaterial/LeMat-Traj and https://github.com/LeMaterial/lematerial-fetcher.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pseudo-Kinematic Trajectory Control and Planning of Tracked Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18641v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracked vehicles distribute their weight continuously over a large surface area (the tracks). This distinctive feature makes them the preferred choice for vehicles required to traverse soft and uneven terrain. From a robotics perspective, however, this flexibility comes at a cost: the complexity of modelling the system and the resulting difficulty in designing theoretically sound navigation solutions. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing a framework for the navigation of tracked vehicles, built upon three key pillars. The first pillar comprises two models: a simulation model and a control-oriented model. The simulation model captures the intricate terramechanics dynamics arising from soil-track interaction and is employed to develop faithful digital twins of the system across a wide range of operating conditions. The control-oriented model is pseudo-kinematic and mathematically tractable, enabling the design of efficient and theoretically robust control schemes. The second pillar is a Lyapunov-based feedback trajectory controller that provides certifiable tracking guarantees. The third pillar is a portfolio of motion planning solutions, each offering different complexity-accuracy trade-offs. The various components of the proposed approach are validated through an extensive set of simulation and experimental data.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages temporal graph networks for learning task-agnostic temporal sequencing and Gaussian Processes for spatial trajectory modeling, ensuring modularity and generalization across various tasks. By decoupling temporal and spatial aspects, DDACE requires only a small number of demonstrations, significantly reducing data requirements compared to traditional learning from demonstration approaches. To validate our proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments in task environments designed to assess various aspects of multi-robot coordination-such as multi-sequence execution, multi-action dynamics, complex trajectory generation, and heterogeneous configurations. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully achieves task execution under few-shot learning conditions and generalizes effectively across dynamic and diverse settings. This work underscores the potential of modular architectures in enhancing the practicality and scalability of multi-robot systems in real-world applications.

This study presents a Transformer-based framework for predicting the disease risk at the terminal locations of migratory bird trajectories. We integrate multi-source datasets, including GPS tracking data from Movebank, outbreak records from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), and geospatial context from GADM and Natural Earth. The raw coordinates are processed using H3 hierarchical geospatial encoding to capture spatial patterns. The model learns spatiotemporal dependencies from bird movement sequences to estimate endpoint disease risk. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.9821, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9803, average precision (AP) of 0.9299, and an F1-score of 0.8836 at the optimal threshold. These results highlight the potential of Transformer architectures to support early-warning systems for avian disease surveillance, enabling timely intervention and prevention strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[TGT: Text-Grounded Trajectories for Locally Controlled Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15104v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video generation has advanced rapidly in visual fidelity, whereas standard methods still have limited ability to control the subject composition of generated scenes. Prior work shows that adding localized text control signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings, offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles, pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion. Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with prior approaches.

State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent (SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients, slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates, specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients, accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets, yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

Most modern trajectory planning techniques rely on numerical optimization because high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy constraints can be systematically computed. However, strict requirements on computation time and the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical situations. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework called STITCHER that leverages graph search to generate long-range trajectories by stitching short trajectory segments together in real time. STITCHER is shown to outperform modern optimization-based planners through its innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible.

Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and captioning object trajectories.

Modern trajectory planning techniques primarily use numerical optimization, as they enable the systematic computation of high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints. However, stringent requirements on computation time and the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework called STITCHER that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long-range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. STITCHER outperforms modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is performed to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, along with a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners. Simulation tests show that safe trajectories can be created within a few milliseconds for paths that span the entirety of two 50 m x 50 m environments. Hardware tests with a custom quadrotor verify that STITCHER can produce trackable paths in real-time while respecting nonconvex constraints, such as limits on tilt angle and motor forces, which are otherwise hard to include in optimization-based planners.</p></details> |  |

However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight: treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit \textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions. Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5 downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj. Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PRTraj.</p></details> |  |

The atomic unit of a video, the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network, Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC) 2026 - Las Vegas, NV, USA 9 - 12 January 2026</p></details> |

However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density. Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854 and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.

| **[Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion: Fast Generation with Interpretable Diffusion Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12220v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories. Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image synthesis in generative modeling.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs' zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction, behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output. This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by The 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Generative and Agentic AI for Multi-Modality Space-Time Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning with Generative Trajectory Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11499v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex, multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow, iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue, lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Building upon grasp-matrix formulations and internal force redundancy, we propose a feedback wrench controller that actively regulates the payload's pose while an optimization layer dynamically shapes internal-force oscillations to guarantee persistent carrier motion. Preliminary experimental results on multirotor UAVs validate the model assumptions, and numerical simulations demonstrate that the method successfully prevents carrier stagnation, achieves accurate load tracking, and generates physically feasible trajectories with smooth velocity profiles. The proposed framework not only advances the state of the art but also offers a reliable, versatile solution for future real-world applications requiring load transportation by coordinated non-stopping flying carriers.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving practical RPF remains challenging due to frequent occlusions, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments. Existing approaches often rely on fixed-point following or sparse candidate-point selection with oversimplified heuristics, which cannot adequately handle complex occlusions caused by moving obstacles such as pedestrians. To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive trajectory sampling method that generates dense candidate points within socially aware zones and evaluates them using a multi-objective cost function. Based on the optimal point, a person-following trajectory is estimated relative to the predicted motion of the target. We further design a prediction-aware model predictive path integral (MPPI) controller that simultaneously tracks this trajectory and proactively avoids collisions using predicted pedestrian motions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in smoothness, safety, robustness, and human comfort, with its effectiveness further demonstrated on a mobile robot in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://adap-rpf.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Future-Aware End-to-End Driving: Bidirectional Modeling of Trajectory Planning and Scene Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11092v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds. Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene, then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories. Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Controllable Generative Trajectory Prediction via Weak Preference Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10731v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models such as conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) have shown great promise for predicting trajectories of surrounding agents in autonomous vehicle planning. State-of-the-art models have achieved remarkable accuracy in such prediction tasks. Besides accuracy, diversity is also crucial for safe planning because human behaviors are inherently uncertain and multimodal. However, existing methods generally lack a scheme to generate controllably diverse trajectories, which is arguably more useful than randomly diversified trajectories, to the end of safe planning. To address this, we propose PrefCVAE, an augmented CVAE framework that uses weakly labeled preference pairs to imbue latent variables with semantic attributes. Using average velocity as an example attribute, we demonstrate that PrefCVAE enables controllable, semantically meaningful predictions without degrading baseline accuracy. Our results show the effectiveness of preference supervision as a cost-effective way to enhance sampling-based generative models.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents' summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 GenAI4Health Workshop</p></details> |

This study conducts a comprehensive scientometric analysis of research on data-driven pedestrian trajectory prediction and crowd simulation, mapping its intellectual evolution and interdisciplinary structure. Using bibliometric data from the Web of Science Core Collection, we employ SciExplorer and Bibliometrix to identify major trends, influential contributors, and emerging frontiers. Results reveal a strong convergence between artificial intelligence, urban informatics, and crowd behavior modeling--driven by graph neural networks, transformers, and generative models. Beyond technical advances, the field increasingly informs urban mobility design, public safety planning, and digital twin development for smart cities. However, challenges remain in ensuring interpretability, inclusivity, and cross-domain transferability. By connecting methodological trajectories with urban applications, this work highlights how data-driven approaches can enrich urban governance and pave the way for adaptive, socially responsible mobility intelligence in future cities.</p></details> | 5 figures |

This significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains, ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid, it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments through more effective utilization of past experiences.</p></details> |  |

Accurately modeling such behavior remains challenging due to the complexity of pairwise spatial-temporal interactions and the heterogeneous influence of groupwise dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. Hyper-STTN constructs multiscale hypergraphs of varying group sizes to model groupwise correlations, captured through spectral hypergraph convolution based on random-walk probabilities. In parallel, a spatial-temporal transformer is employed to learn pedestrians' pairwise latent interactions across spatial and temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous groupwise and pairwise features are subsequently fused and aligned via a multimodal transformer. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian motion datasets demonstrate that Hyper-STTN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Attacks on Downstream Weather Forecasting Models: Application to Tropical Cyclone Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10140v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning based weather forecasting (DLWF) models leverage past weather observations to generate future forecasts, supporting a wide range of downstream tasks, including tropical cyclone (TC) trajectory prediction. In this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque, non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.</p></details> |  |

While existing works evaluate the LLMs' tool use capability, they largely focus on the final answers yet overlook the detailed tool usage trajectory, i.e., whether tools are selected, parameterized, and ordered correctly. We introduce TRAJECT-Bench, a trajectory-aware benchmark to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' tool use capability through diverse tasks with fine-grained evaluation metrics. TRAJECT-Bench pairs high-fidelity, executable tools across practical domains with tasks grounded in production-style APIs, and synthesizes trajectories that vary in breadth (parallel calls) and depth (interdependent chains). Besides final accuracy, TRAJECT-Bench also reports trajectory-level diagnostics, including tool selection and argument correctness, and dependency/order satisfaction. Analyses reveal failure modes such as similar tool confusion and parameter-blind selection, and scaling behavior with tool diversity and trajectory length where the bottleneck of transiting from short to mid-length trajectories is revealed, offering actionable guidance for LLMs' tool use.</p></details> |  |

Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves 81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task, outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the MICCAI 2025 Learning with Longitudinal Medical Images and Data Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Flow-Opt: Scalable Centralized Multi-Robot Trajectory Optimization with Flow Matching and Differentiable Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09204v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Centralized trajectory optimization in the joint space of multiple robots allows access to a larger feasible space that can result in smoother trajectories, especially while planning in tight spaces. Unfortunately, it is often computationally intractable beyond a very small swarm size. In this paper, we propose Flow-Opt, a learning-based approach towards improving the computational tractability of centralized multi-robot trajectory optimization. Specifically, we reduce the problem to first learning a generative model to sample different candidate trajectories and then using a learned Safety-Filter(SF) to ensure fast inference-time constraint satisfaction. We propose a flow-matching model with a diffusion transformer (DiT) augmented with permutation invariant robot position and map encoders as the generative model. We develop a custom solver for our SF and equip it with a neural network that predicts context-specific initialization. The initialization network is trained in a self-supervised manner, taking advantage of the differentiability of the SF solver. We advance the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that we can generate trajectories of tens of robots in cluttered environments in a few tens of milliseconds. This is several times faster than existing centralized optimization approaches. Moreover, our approach also generates smoother trajectories orders of magnitude faster than competing baselines based on diffusion models. Second, each component of our approach can be batched, allowing us to solve a few tens of problem instances in a fraction of a second. We believe this is a first such result; no existing approach provides such capabilities. Finally, our approach can generate a diverse set of trajectories between a given set of start and goal locations, which can capture different collision-avoidance behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[ResAD: Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08562v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  |

FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues, enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning, drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible action control and mesh animations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://bestzzhang.github.io/FlexTraj</p></details> |

Existing methods rely on paired datasets or hand-crafted rewards, which limit scalability and generalization. We propose TrajSkill, a framework for Trajectory Conditioned Cross-embodiment Skill Transfer, enabling robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from human demonstration videos. Our key insight is to represent human motions as sparse optical flow trajectories, which serve as embodiment-agnostic motion cues by removing morphological variations while preserving essential dynamics. Conditioned on these trajectories together with visual and textual inputs, TrajSkill jointly synthesizes temporally consistent robot manipulation videos and translates them into executable actions, thereby achieving cross-embodiment skill transfer. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results on simulation data (MetaWorld) show that TrajSkill reduces FVD by 39.6\% and KVD by 36.6\% compared with the state-of-the-art, and improves cross-embodiment success rate by up to 16.7\%. Real-robot experiments in kitchen manipulation tasks further validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating practical human-to-robot skill transfer across embodiments.</p></details> |  |

However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data. The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation. In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.</p></details> |  |

Existing GPU-accelerated approaches typically (i) parallelize a single solve to meet real-time deadlines, (ii) scale to very large batches at slower-than-real-time rates, or (iii) achieve speed by restricting model generality (e.g., point-mass dynamics or a single linearization). This leaves a large gap in solver performance for many state-of-the-art MPC applications that require real-time batches of tens to low-hundreds of solves. As such, we present GATO, an open source, GPU-accelerated, batched TO solver co-designed across algorithm, software, and computational hardware to deliver real-time throughput for these moderate batch size regimes. Our approach leverages a combination of block-, warp-, and thread-level parallelism within and across solves for ultra-high performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a combination of: simulated benchmarks showing speedups of 18-21x over CPU baselines and 1.4-16x over GPU baselines as batch size increases; case studies highlighting improved disturbance rejection and convergence behavior; and finally a validation on hardware using an industrial manipulator. We open source GATO to support reproducibility and adoption.</p></details> |  |

This research establishes a comprehensive, mathematically rigorous framework for trajectory prediction that moves beyond empirical modeling to a geomechanically-informed, data-driven surrogate approach.The study leverages Log ASCII Standard (LAS) and wellbore deviation (DEV) data from 14 wells in the Gulfaks oil field, treating petrophysical logs not merely as input features, but as proxies for the mechanical properties of the rock that fundamentally govern drilling dynamics. A key contribution of this work is the formal derivation of wellbore kinematic models, including the Average Angle method and Dogleg Severity, from the first principles of vector calculus and differential geometry, contextualizing them as robust numerical integration schemes. The core of the predictive model is a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network, for which we provide a complete, step-by-step derivation of the forward propagation dynamics and the Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) training algorithm. This detailed theoretical exposition, often omitted in applied studies, clarifies the mechanisms by which the network learns temporal dependencies. The methodology encompasses a theoretically justified data preprocessing pipeline, including feature normalization, uniform depth resampling, and sequence generation. Trajectory post-processing and error analysis are conducted using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the Coefficient of Determination (R2).</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing approaches face critical limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for efficient deep search systems.

A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)</p></details> |
| **[Diffusing Trajectory Optimization Problems for Recovery During Multi-Finger Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07030v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-fingered hands are emerging as powerful platforms for performing fine manipulation tasks, including tool use. However, environmental perturbations or execution errors can impede task performance, motivating the use of recovery behaviors that enable normal task execution to resume. In this work, we take advantage of recent advances in diffusion models to construct a framework that autonomously identifies when recovery is necessary and optimizes contact-rich trajectories to recover. We use a diffusion model trained on the task to estimate when states are not conducive to task execution, framed as an out-of-distribution detection problem. We then use diffusion sampling to project these states in-distribution and use trajectory optimization to plan contact-rich recovery trajectories. We also propose a novel diffusion-based approach that distills this process to efficiently diffuse the full parameterization, including constraints, goal state, and initialization, of the recovery trajectory optimization problem, saving time during online execution. We compare our method to a reinforcement learning baseline and other methods that do not explicitly plan contact interactions, including on a hardware screwdriver-turning task where we show that recovering using our method improves task performance by 96% and that ours is the only method evaluated that can attempt recovery without causing catastrophic task failure.

| **[Understanding Software Engineering Agents: A Study of Thought-Action-Result Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18824v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly employed to automate complex software engineering tasks, such as program repair and issue resolution. These agents operate by autonomously generating natural language thoughts, invoking external tools, and iteratively refining their solutions. Despite their widespread adoption, the internal decision-making processes of these agents remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of their operational dynamics and failure modes. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of the thought-action-result trajectories of three state-of-the-art LLM-based agents: RepairAgent, AutoCodeRover, and OpenHands. We unify their interaction logs into a common format, capturing 120 trajectories and 2,822 LLM interactions focused on program repair and issue resolution. Our study combines quantitative analyses of structural properties, action patterns, and token usage with qualitative assessments of reasoning coherence and feedback integration. We identify key trajectory characteristics, such as iteration counts and token consumption, recurring action sequences, and the semantic coherence of thoughts, actions, and their results. Our findings reveal behavioral motifs and anti-patterns that distinguish successful from failed executions, providing actionable insights for improving agent design, including prompting strategies, failure diagnosis, and anti-pattern detection. We release our dataset and annotation framework to support further research on transparent and robust autonomous software engineering agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACCEP...</summary><p>ACCEPTED FOR ASE 2025</p></details> |

We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further reference.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Longitudinal Flow Matching for Trajectory Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03569v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models for sequential data often struggle with sparsely sampled and high-dimensional trajectories, typically reducing the learning of dynamics to pairwise transitions. We propose Interpolative Multi-Marginal Flow Matching (IMMFM), a framework that learns continuous stochastic dynamics jointly consistent with multiple observed time points. IMMFM employs a piecewise-quadratic interpolation path as a smooth target for flow matching and jointly optimizes drift and a data-driven diffusion coefficient, supported by a theoretical condition for stable learning. This design captures intrinsic stochasticity, handles irregular sparse sampling, and yields subject-specific trajectories. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world longitudinal neuroimaging datasets show that IMMFM outperforms existing methods in both forecasting accuracy and further downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally Smooth Mesh Extraction for Procedural Scenes with Long-Range Camera Trajectories using Spacetime Octrees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13306v3)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The procedural occupancy function is a flexible and compact representation for creating 3D scenes. For rasterization and other tasks, it is often necessary to extract a mesh that represents the shape. Unbounded scenes with long-range camera trajectories, such as flying through a forest, pose a unique challenge for mesh extraction. A single static mesh representing all the geometric detail necessary for the full camera path can be prohibitively large. Therefore, independent meshes can be extracted for different camera views, but this approach may lead to popping artifacts during transitions. We propose a temporally coherent method for extracting meshes suitable for long-range camera trajectories in unbounded scenes represented by an occupancy function. The key idea is to perform 4D mesh extraction using a new spacetime tree structure called a binary-octree. Experiments show that, compared to existing baseline methods, our method offers superior visual consistency at a comparable cost.

| **[Nearly Instance-Optimal Parameter Recovery from Many Trajectories via Hellinger Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06434v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from temporally-correlated data is a core facet of modern machine learning. Yet our understanding of sequential learning remains incomplete, particularly in the multi-trajectory setting where data consists of many independent realizations of a time-indexed stochastic process. This important regime both reflects modern training pipelines such as for large foundation models, and offers the potential for learning without the typical mixing assumptions made in the single-trajectory case. However, instance-optimal bounds are known only for least-squares regression with dependent covariates; for more general models or loss functions, the only broadly applicable guarantees result from a reduction to either i.i.d. learning, with effective sample size scaling only in the number of trajectories, or an existing single-trajectory result when each individual trajectory mixes, with effective sample size scaling as the full data budget deflated by the mixing-time. In this work, we significantly broaden the scope of instance-optimal rates in multi-trajectory settings via the Hellinger localization framework, a general approach for maximum likelihood estimation. Our method proceeds by first controlling the squared Hellinger distance at the path-measure level via a reduction to i.i.d. learning, followed by localization as a quadratic form in parameter space weighted by the trajectory Fisher information. This yields instance-optimal bounds that scale with the full data budget under a broad set of conditions. We instantiate our framework across four diverse case studies: a simple mixture of Markov chains, dependent linear regression under non-Gaussian noise, generalized linear models with non-monotonic activations, and linear-attention sequence models. In all cases, our bounds nearly match the instance-optimal rates from asymptotic normality, substantially improving over standard reductions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Off-Trajectory Reasoning: Can LLMs Collaborate on Reasoning Trajectory?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06410v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning LLMs are trained to verbalize their reasoning process, yielding strong gains on complex tasks. This transparency also opens a promising direction: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking within a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and exploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the usefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this off-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can standard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory behaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the off-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can backtrack from "distractions" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and Guidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from stronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and reveals a counterintuitive finding -- "stronger" LLMs on benchmarks are often more fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively leverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent capabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control studies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these behaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data selection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training natively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal recoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled students even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together, this work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in shared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf reasoning LLMs.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multimodal Trajectory Representation Learning for Travel Time Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05840v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches typically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting the inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to information loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE accuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics, while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong generalization abilities. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/freshhxy/MDTI/</p></details> |  |
| **[Traj-Transformer: Diffusion Models with Transformer for GPS Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06291v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of GPS devices has driven advances in spatiotemporal data mining, enabling machine learning models to simulate human decision making and generate realistic trajectories, addressing both data collection costs and privacy concerns. Recent studies have shown the promise of diffusion models for high-quality trajectory generation. However, most existing methods rely on convolution based architectures (e.g. UNet) to predict noise during the diffusion process, which often results in notable deviations and the loss of fine-grained street-level details due to limited model capacity. In this paper, we propose Trajectory Transformer, a novel model that employs a transformer backbone for both conditional information embedding and noise prediction. We explore two GPS coordinate embedding strategies, location embedding and longitude-latitude embedding, and analyze model performance at different scales. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Trajectory Transformer significantly enhances generation quality and effectively alleviates the deviation issues observed in prior approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentRewardBench: Evaluating Automatic Evaluations of Web Agent Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08942v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web agents enable users to perform tasks on web browsers through natural language interaction. Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations. We release the benchmark at: https://agent-reward-bench.github.io</p></details> |  |
| **[Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture filter for trajectory measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08421v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter for multi-target filtering based on sensor measurements that are sets of trajectories in the last two-time step window. The proposed filter, the trajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the set of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the set of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated with the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM posterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM density on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution for multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating the set of target states at the end of each time window. Additionally, the paper proposes computationally lighter alternatives to the TM-PMBM filter by deriving a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) density through Kullback-Leibler divergence minimisation in an augmented space with auxiliary variables. The performance of the proposed filters are evaluated in a simulation study.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, journal paper</p></details> |
| **[RareGraph-Synth: Knowledge-Guided Diffusion Models for Generating Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Patient Trajectories in Ultra-Rare Diseases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06267v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose RareGraph-Synth, a knowledge-guided, continuous-time diffusion framework that generates realistic yet privacy-preserving synthetic electronic-health-record (EHR) trajectories for ultra-rare diseases. RareGraph-Synth unifies five public resources: Orphanet/Orphadata, the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), the GARD rare-disease KG, PrimeKG, and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) into a heterogeneous knowledge graph comprising approximately 8 M typed edges. Meta-path scores extracted from this 8-million-edge KG modulate the per-token noise schedule in the forward stochastic differential equation, steering generation toward biologically plausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining score-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces timestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag triples that contain no protected health information. On simulated ultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean Discrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by greater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream predictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the DOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55 safe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61 plus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong resistance to re-identification. These results suggest that integrating biomedical knowledge graphs directly into diffusion noise schedules can simultaneously enhance fidelity and privacy, enabling safer data sharing for rare-disease research.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables.

| **[PAD-TRO: Projection-Augmented Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04436v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have gained popularity and attention in trajectory optimization due to their capability of modeling multi-modal probability distributions. However, addressing nonlinear equality constraints, i.e, dynamic feasi- bility, remains a great challenge in diffusion-based trajectory optimization. Recent diffusion-based trajectory optimization frameworks rely on a single-shooting style approach where the denoised control sequence is applied to forward propagate the dynamical system, which cannot explicitly enforce constraints on the states and frequently leads to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we propose a novel direct trajectory optimization approach via model-based diffusion, which directly generates a sequence of states. To ensure dynamic feasibility, we propose a gradient-free projection mechanism that is incorporated into the reverse diffusion process. Our results show that, compared to a recent state-of-the-art baseline, our approach leads to zero dynamic feasibility error and approximately 4x higher success rate in a quadrotor waypoint navigation scenario involving dense static obstacles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion^2: Dual Diffusion Model with Uncertainty-Aware Adaptive Noise for Momentary Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04365v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency in autonomous driving and human-robot interaction scenarios. Earlier studies primarily utilized sufficient observational data to predict future trajectories. However, in real-world scenarios, such as pedestrians suddenly emerging from blind spots, sufficient observational data is often unavailable (i.e. momentary trajectory), making accurate prediction challenging and increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Therefore, advancing research on pedestrian trajectory prediction under extreme scenarios is critical for enhancing traffic safety. In this work, we propose a novel framework termed Diffusion^2, tailored for momentary trajectory prediction. Diffusion^2 consists of two sequentially connected diffusion models: one for backward prediction, which generates unobserved historical trajectories, and the other for forward prediction, which forecasts future trajectories. Given that the generated unobserved historical trajectories may introduce additional noise, we propose a dual-head parameterization mechanism to estimate their aleatoric uncertainty and design a temporally adaptive noise module that dynamically modulates the noise scale in the forward diffusion process. Empirically, Diffusion^2 sets a new state-of-the-art in momentary trajectory prediction on ETH/UCY and Stanford Drone datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[NoTVLA: Narrowing of Dense Action Trajectories for Generalizable Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03895v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a pivotal advance in embodied intelligence, yet they confront critical barriers to real-world deployment, most notably catastrophic forgetting. This issue stems from their overreliance on continuous action sequences or action chunks, which inadvertently create isolated data silos that disrupt knowledge retention across tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA) framework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories, thereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory fine-tuning. A key innovation of NoTVLA lies in its trajectory planning strategy: instead of centering on the target object's trajectory, it leverages temporal compression and spatial reasoning pruning specifically for the robot end effector's trajectory. Furthermore, training is conducted using these sparse trajectories rather than dense action trajectories, an optimization that delivers remarkable practical advantages with better performance in zero-shot. In multi-task evaluation scenarios, NoTVLA achieves superior performance and generalization compared to pi0 while operating under two critical constraints: it uses over an order of magnitude less computing power than pi0 and requires no wrist-mounted camera. This design ensures that NoTVLA's operational accuracy closely approximates that of single-task expert models. Crucially, it also preserves the model's inherent language capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization in specific scenarios, supporting unified model deployment across multiple robot platforms, and fostering a degree of generalization even when perceiving tasks from novel perspectives.</p></details> |  |

The dynamics of those agents strongly depends on their tasks, roles, or observable labels. Class-conditioned motion prediction is thus an appealing way to reduce forecast uncertainty and get more accurate predictions for heterogeneous agents. However, this is hardly explored in the prior art, especially for mobile robots and in limited data applications. In this paper, we analyse different class-conditioned trajectory prediction methods on two datasets. We propose a set of conditional pattern-based and efficient deep learning-based baselines, and evaluate their performance on robotics and outdoors datasets (TH\"OR-MAGNI and Stanford Drone Dataset). Our experiments show that all methods improve accuracy in most of the settings when considering class labels. More importantly, we observe that there are significant differences when learning from imbalanced datasets, or in new environments where sufficient data is not available. In particular, we find that deep learning methods perform better on balanced datasets, but in applications with limited data, e.g., cold start of a robot in a new environment, or imbalanced classes, pattern-based methods may be preferable.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters journal and presented at the 40th Anniversary of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, which was held in Rotterdam, Netherlands on 23-26 September, 2024</p></details> |

We present Dynamic Neural Potential Field (NPField-GPT), a learning-enhanced model predictive control (MPC) framework that couples classical optimization with a Transformer-based predictor of footprint-aware repulsive potentials. Given an occupancy sub-map, robot footprint, and optional dynamic-obstacle cues, our autoregressive NPField-GPT head forecasts a horizon of differentiable potentials that are injected into a sequential quadratic MPC program via L4CasADi, yielding real-time, constraint-aware trajectory optimization. We additionally study two baselines: (NPField-D1) static-frame decomposition and (NPField-D2) parallel MLP heads for all steps. In dynamic indoor scenarios from BenchMR and on a Husky UGV in office corridors, NPField-GPT produces safer, more conservative trajectories under motion changes, while D1/D2 offer lower latency. We also compare with the CIAO* and MPPI baselines. Across methods, the Transformer+MPC synergy preserves the transparency and stability of model-based planning while learning only the part that benefits from data: spatiotemporal collision risk.

When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage is available at https://follow-your-shape.github.io/</p></details> |

Prior work established that statistically efficient learning is impossible for either of these problems when the only assumptions are that the data has good coverage (concentrability) and the state-action value function of every policy is linearly realizable ($q^\pi$-realizability) (Foster et al., 2021). Recently, Tkachuk et al. (2024) gave a statistically efficient learner for policy optimization, if in addition the data is assumed to be given as trajectories. In this work we present a statistically efficient learner for policy evaluation under the same assumptions. Further, we show that the sample complexity of the learner used by Tkachuk et al. (2024) for policy optimization can be improved by a tighter analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often struggle to model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality, obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process. Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://reagan1311.github.io/mask2iv</p></details> |

However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication, the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$ on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in safeguarding sensitive data.</p></details> |  |

The importance of accurate real-time performance of the controller lies in safety considerations of situations where the dynamic system under control is affected by uncertainties and disturbances, and the controller should compensate for such phenomena in order to provide stable performance. A multiple-shooting nonlinear model-predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. This framework benefits from suitable algorithm along with readings from various sensors for genuine real-time performance with extremely high accuracy. The controller is then tested for tracking different trajectories where it demonstrates highly desirable performance in terms of both speed and accuracy. This controller shows remarkable improvement when compared to existing nonlinear model-predictive controllers in the literature that were implemented on skid-steered mobile platforms.</p></details> |  |

We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically, ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints, ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence.

However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity. The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation. Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning ($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of REACT-Drive.</p></details> | 13 pages,5 figures |
| **[Distributed Koopman Learning using Partial Trajectories for Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07212v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a distributed data-driven framework for dynamics learning, termed distributed deep Koopman learning using partial trajectories (DDKL-PT). In this framework, each agent in a multi-agent system is assigned a partial trajectory offline and locally approximates the unknown dynamics using a deep neural network within the Koopman operator framework. By exchanging local estimated dynamics rather than training data, agents achieve consensus on a global dynamics model without sharing their private training trajectories. Simulation studies on a surface vehicle demonstrate that DDKL-PT attains consensus with respect to the learned dynamics, with each agent achieving reasonably small approximation errors over the testing data. Furthermore, a model predictive control scheme is developed by integrating the learned Koopman dynamics with known kinematic relations. Results on goal-tracking and station-keeping tasks support that the distributedly learned dynamics are sufficiently accurate for model-based optimal control.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Trajectory Generator for High-Density Traffic and Diverse Agent-Interaction Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02627v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is fundamental to autonomous driving, as it underpins safe motion planning and collision avoidance in complex environments. However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous road environments into a structured grid representation that supports fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety. Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Best Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18873v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful approach for aligning generative models, but its reliance on learned reward models makes it vulnerable to mis-specification and reward hacking. Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) offers a more robust alternative by directly leveraging noisy binary comparisons over trajectories. We study the best policy identification problem in PbRL, motivated by post-training optimization of generative models, for example, during multi-turn interactions. Learning in this setting combines an offline preference dataset--potentially biased or out-of-distribution and collected from a rater of subpar 'competence'--with online pure exploration, making systematic online learning essential. To this end, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling that maintains posteriors over the reward model and dynamics. We provide the first Bayesian simple regret guarantees for PbRL and introduce an efficient approximation that outperforms existing baselines on simulation and image generation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCoT: Unifying Consistency Models and Rectified Flows via Straight-Consistent Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16972v4)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained diffusion models are commonly used to generate clean data (e.g., images) from random noises, effectively forming pairs of noises and corresponding clean images. Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.</p></details> |  |

Recent embodied systems often adopt a dual-system paradigm, where System 2 handles high-level reasoning while System 1 executes low-level control. In this work, we refer to System 2 as the embodied brain, emphasizing its role as the cognitive core for reasoning and decision-making in manipulation tasks. Given this role, systematic evaluation of the embodied brain is essential. Yet existing benchmarks emphasize execution success, or when targeting high-level reasoning, suffer from incomplete dimensions and limited task realism, offering only a partial picture of cognitive capability. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoboBench, a benchmark that systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as embodied brains. Motivated by the critical roles across the full manipulation pipeline, RoboBench defines five dimensions-instruction comprehension, perception reasoning, generalized planning, affordance prediction, and failure analysis-spanning 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs. To ensure realism, we curate datasets across diverse embodiments, attribute-rich objects, and multi-view scenes, drawing from large-scale real robotic data. For planning, RoboBench introduces an evaluation framework, MLLM-as-world-simulator. It evaluate embodied feasibility by simulating whether predicted plans can achieve critical object-state changes. Experiments on 14 MLLMs reveal fundamental limitations: difficulties with implicit instruction comprehension, spatiotemporal reasoning, cross-scenario planning, fine-grained affordance understanding, and execution failure diagnosis. RoboBench provides a comprehensive scaffold to quantify high-level cognition, and guide the development of next-generation embodied MLLMs. The project page is in https://robo-bench.github.io.</p></details> |  |

We Will Find Better Configurations More Quickly Than Retraining From Scratch!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17748v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tuning database management systems (DBMSs) is challenging due to trillions of possible configurations and evolving workloads. Recent advances in tuning have led to breakthroughs in optimizing over the possible configurations. However, due to their design and inability to leverage query-level historical insights, existing automated tuners struggle to adapt and re-optimize the DBMS when the environment changes (e.g., workload drift, schema transfer). This paper presents the Booster framework that assists existing tuners in adapting to environment changes (e.g., drift, cross-schema transfer). Booster structures historical artifacts into query-configuration contexts, prompts large language models (LLMs) to suggest configurations for each query based on relevant contexts, and then composes the query-level suggestions into a holistic configuration with beam search. With multiple OLAP workloads, we evaluate Booster's ability to assist different state-of-the-art tuners (e.g., cost-/machine learning-/LLM-based) in adapting to environment changes. By composing recommendations derived from query-level insights, Booster assists tuners in discovering configurations that are up to 74% better and in up to 4.7x less time than the alternative approach of continuing to tune from historical configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGMOD2026</p></details> |

Conventional fine-tuning methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while existing parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task scenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a novel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of self-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while preserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient adaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our Hybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a shared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM modules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering, code generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance improvement of 3.65%. The implemented code and data are available to ease reproducibility at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/HyCAM.</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM' 25 |

Newly accessible Irish corpora and English text are mixed and curated to improve Irish performance while preserving English ability. 6 closed-weight LLMs are judged for their Irish text generation by a native speaker, a learner and other LLMs. Google's Gemini-2.5-Pro is ranked the highest and is subsequently used to synthesise instruction tuning and human preference datasets. Two datasets are contributed leveraging Gemini-2.5-Pro: a 30K Irish-English parallel instruction tuning dataset and a 1K human preference dataset, generating accepted and rejected responses that show near perfect alignment with a native Irish speaker. Qomhr\'a is comprehensively evaluated across benchmarks testing translation, gender understanding, topic identification and world knowledge with gains of up to 29% in Irish and 44% in English. Qomhr\'a also undergoes instruction tuning and demonstrates clear progress in instruction following, crucial for chatbot functionality.</p></details> |  |
| **[SARSteer: Safeguarding Large Audio Language Models via Safe-Ablated Refusal Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17633v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are becoming essential as a powerful multimodal backbone for real-world applications. However, recent studies show that audio inputs can more easily elicit harmful responses than text, exposing new risks toward deployment. While safety alignment has made initial advances in LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), we find that vanilla adaptation of these approaches to LALMs faces two key limitations: 1) LLM-based steering fails under audio input due to the large distributional gap between activations, and 2) prompt-based defenses induce over-refusals on benign-speech queries. To address these challenges, we propose Safe-Ablated Refusal Steering (SARSteer), the first inference-time defense framework for LALMs. Specifically, SARSteer leverages text-derived refusal steering to enforce rejection without manipulating audio inputs and introduces decomposed safe-space ablation to mitigate over-refusal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SARSteer significantly improves harmful-query refusal while preserving benign responses, establishing a principled step toward safety alignment in LALMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forget to Know, Remember to Use: Context-Aware Unlearning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17620v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models may encode sensitive information or outdated knowledge that needs to be removed, to ensure responsible and compliant model responses. Unlearning has emerged as an efficient alternative to full retraining, aiming to remove specific knowledge while preserving overall model utility. Existing evaluations of unlearning methods focus on (1) the extent of forgetting of the target knowledge (forget set) and (2) maintaining performance on the retain set (i.e., utility). However, these evaluations overlook an important usability aspect: users may still want the model to leverage the removed information if it is re-introduced in the prompt. In a systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art unlearning methods, we find that they consistently impair such contextual utility. To address this, we augment unlearning objectives with a plug-in term that preserves the model's ability to use forgotten knowledge when it is present in context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach restores contextual utility to near original levels while still maintaining effective forgetting and retain-set utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[PsychCounsel-Bench: Evaluating the Psychology Intelligence of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01611v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities, such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper investigates the key question: \textit{Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological counseling?} To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S. National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a role. To address this, we introduce PsychCounsel-Bench, a benchmark grounded in U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional counselors that requires about 70\% accuracy to pass. PsychCounsel-Bench comprises approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B) remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs. We release the proposed dataset for public use: https://github.com/cloversjtu/PsychCounsel-Bench</p></details> |  |

However, training large-scale video generation models remains particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii) training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations. More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights, Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public release of large-scale video generation training code that exploits Megatron-Core to achieve high training efficiency and near-linear multi-node scaling, details are available in \href{https://github.com/Shopee-MUG/MUG-V}{our webpage}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report; Project Page: \href{https://github.com/Shopee-MUG/MUG-V}</p></details> |

Current evaluations are fragmented, based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale, standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off: instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: http://simbench.tiancheng.hu/ Data: https://huggingface.co/datasets/pitehu/SimBench</p></details> |

This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers.

Existing evaluation approaches fall into three categories, including human-centered, metric-based, and LLM-based. Considering that human-centered approaches are labour-intensive and metric-based ones overly rely on reference answers, LLM-based approaches are gaining increasing attention due to their stronger contextual understanding capabilities. However, they generally evaluate the generated code based on static prompts, and tend to fail for complex code scenarios which typically involve multiple requirements and require more contextual information. In addition, these approaches lack fine-grained evaluation for complex code, resulting in limited explainability. To mitigate the limitations, we propose CodeVisionary, the first agent-based evaluation framework for complex code generation. CodeVisionary consists of two stages: (1) Requirement-guided multi-dimensional context distillation stage and (2) Fine-grained scoring and summarization stage. A comprehensive evaluation report is also generated for enhanced explainability. For validation, we construct a new benchmark consisting of 363 samples spanning 37 coding scenarios and 23 programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeVisionary achieves the best performance among three baselines for evaluating complex code generation, outperforming the best baseline with average improvements of 0.217, 0.163, and 0.141 in Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall-Tau coefficients, respectively.

To overcome these limitations, we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific learning to task-specific learning.

To advance research in this area, we introduce the first evaluation datasets for Urdu to English idiomatic translation, covering both Native Urdu and Roman Urdu scripts and annotated with gold-standard English equivalents. We evaluate multiple open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems on this task, focusing on their ability to preserve idiomatic and cultural meaning. Automatic metrics including BLEU, BERTScore, COMET, and XCOMET are used to assess translation quality. Our findings indicate that prompt engineering enhances idiomatic translation compared to direct translation, though performance differences among prompt types are relatively minor. Moreover, cross script comparisons reveal that text representation substantially affects translation quality, with Native Urdu inputs producing more accurate idiomatic translations than Roman Urdu.</p></details> |  |

However, applying large language models (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic reasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain LLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal integration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these limitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM, integrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback refinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning rather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and ethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive knowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based instruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation mechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process involving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for tongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic access to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question benchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior accuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics, herb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an interactive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000 users globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning and multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning generative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Group Relative Policy Optimization to Advance Large Language Models in Traditional Chinese Medicine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17402v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) presents a rich and structurally unique knowledge system that challenges conventional applications of large language models (LLMs). Although previous TCM-specific LLMs have shown progress through supervised fine-tuning, they often face limitations in alignment, data quality, and evaluation consistency. In this study, we introduce Ladder-base, the first TCM-focused LLM trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that improves reasoning and factual consistency by optimizing response selection based on intra-group comparisons. Ladder-base is built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model and trained exclusively on the textual subset of the TCM-Ladder benchmark, using 80 percent of the data for training and the remaining 20 percent split evenly between validation and test sets. Through standardized evaluation, Ladder-base demonstrates superior performance across multiple reasoning metrics when compared to both state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3, and Qwen3 and domain-specific TCM models including BenTsao, HuatuoGPT2, and Zhongjing. These findings suggest that GRPO provides an effective and efficient strategy for aligning LLMs with expert-level reasoning in traditional medical domains and supports the development of trustworthy and clinically grounded TCM artificial intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Representation Attack against Aligned Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19360v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly employ alignment techniques to prevent harmful outputs. Despite these safeguards, attackers can circumvent them by crafting prompts that induce LLMs to generate harmful content. Current methods typically target exact affirmative responses, such as ``Sure, here is...'', suffering from limited convergence, unnatural prompts, and high computational costs. We introduce Semantic Representation Attack, a novel paradigm that fundamentally reconceptualizes adversarial objectives against aligned LLMs. Rather than targeting exact textual patterns, our approach exploits the semantic representation space comprising diverse responses with equivalent harmful meanings. This innovation resolves the inherent trade-off between attack efficacy and prompt naturalness that plagues existing methods. The Semantic Representation Heuristic Search algorithm is proposed to efficiently generate semantically coherent and concise adversarial prompts by maintaining interpretability during incremental expansion. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for semantic convergence and demonstrate that our method achieves unprecedented attack success rates (89.41\% averaged across 18 LLMs, including 100\% on 11 models) while maintaining stealthiness and efficiency. Comprehensive experimental results confirm the overall superiority of our Semantic Representation Attack. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

The current paper discusses a parallel implementation of this method, abbreviated as ParaSLRF. The parallelization consists of two levels: (1) on the highest level, the application of the rational filter to the various vectors is partitioned among groups of processors; (2) within each group, every linear system is solved in parallel. In ParaSLRF, the linear systems are solved by iterative methods instead of direct ones, in contrast to other rational filter methods, such as, PFEAST. Because of the specific selection of poles in ParaSLRF, the computational cost of solving the associated linear systems for each pole, is almost the same. This intrinsically leads to a better load balance between each group of resources, and reduces waiting times of processes. We show numerical experiments from finite element models of mechanical vibrations, and show a detailed parallel performance analysis. ParaSLRF shows the best parallel efficiency, compared to other rational filter methods based on quadrature rules for contour integration. To further improve performance, the converged eigenpairs are locked, and a good initial guess of iterative linear solver is proposed. These enhancements of ParaSLRF show good two-level strong scalability and excellent load balance in our experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search of Large Scale Vectors on Distributed Storage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17326v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) in high-dimensional space is an essential operator in many online services, such as information retrieval and recommendation. Indices constructed by the state-of-the-art ANNS algorithms must be stored in single machine's memory or disk for high recall rate and throughput, suffering from substantial storage cost, constraint of limited scale and single point of failure. While distributed storage can provide a cost-effective and robust solution, there is no efficient and effective algorithms for indexing vectors in distributed storage scenarios. In this paper, we present a new graph-cluster hybrid indexing and search system which supports Distributed Storage Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search, called DSANN. DSANN can efficiently index, store, search billion-scale vector database in distributed storage and guarantee the high availability of index service. DSANN employs the concurrent index construction method to significantly reduces the complexity of index building. Then, DSANN applies Point Aggregation Graph to leverage the structural information of graph to aggregate similar vectors, optimizing storage efficiency and improving query throughput via asynchronous I/O in distributed storage. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate DSANN can efficiently and effectively index, store and search large-scale vector datasets in distributed storage scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Here, we propose MapMuse, a storytelling-based framework for interpreting spatio-temporal datasets, transforming them into compelling, narrative-driven experiences. We utilize large language models and employ retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based techniques to generate comprehensive stories. Drawing on principles common in cinematic storytelling, we emphasize clarity, emotional connection, and audience-centric design. As a case study, we analyze a dataset of taxi trajectories. Two perspectives are presented: a captivating story based on a heat map that visualizes millions of taxi trip endpoints to uncover urban mobility patterns; and a detailed narrative following a single long taxi journey, enriched with city landmarks and temporal shifts. By portraying locations as characters and movement as plot, we argue that data storytelling drives insight, engagement, and action from spatio-temporal information. The case study illustrates how MapMuse can bridge the gap between data complexity and human understanding. The aim of this short paper is to provide a glimpse to the potential of the cinematic storytelling technique as an effective communication tool for spatio-temporal data, as well as to describe open problems and opportunities for future research.</p></details> | 5 pages |

However, generalizing cost-effectively to diverse real-world scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose Plug-and-Forecast (PnF), a plug-and-play approach that augments existing motion forecasting models with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). PnF builds on the insight that natural language provides a more effective way to describe and handle complex scenarios, enabling quick adaptation to targeted behaviors. We design prompts to extract structured scene understanding from MLLMs and distill this information into learnable embeddings to augment existing behavior prediction models. Our method leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to achieve significant improvements in motion prediction performance, while requiring no fine-tuning -- making it practical to adopt. We validate our approach on two state-of-the-art motion forecasting models using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across both benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Explainability of Large Language Models: Opportunities and Challenges toward Generating Trustworthy Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17256v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have exhibited impressive performance across a broad range of downstream tasks in natural language processing. However, how a language model predicts the next token and generates content is not generally understandable by humans. Furthermore, these models often make errors in prediction and reasoning, known as hallucinations. These errors underscore the urgent need to better understand and interpret the intricate inner workings of language models and how they generate predictive outputs. Motivated by this gap, this paper investigates local explainability and mechanistic interpretability within Transformer-based large language models to foster trust in such models. In this regard, our paper aims to make three key contributions. First, we present a review of local explainability and mechanistic interpretability approaches and insights from relevant studies in the literature. Furthermore, we describe experimental studies on explainability and reasoning with large language models in two critical domains -- healthcare and autonomous driving -- and analyze the trust implications of such explanations for explanation receivers. Finally, we summarize current unaddressed issues in the evolving landscape of LLM explainability and outline the opportunities, critical challenges, and future directions toward generating human-aligned, trustworthy LLM explanations.</p></details> |  |
| **[StreamingThinker: Large Language Models Can Think While Reading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17238v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chain of thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first design a \textit{\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with \textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation, enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\% reduction in token waiting before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\% reduction in time-level latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning. Code will be released at \href{https://github.com/EIT-NLP/StreamingLLM/tree/main/StreamingThinker}{this repository.}</p></details> |  |

However, variations in activity patterns, device types, and sensor placements create distribution gaps across datasets, reducing the performance of HAR models. To address this, we propose LanHAR, a novel system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantic interpretations of sensor readings and activity labels for cross-dataset HAR. This approach not only mitigates cross-dataset heterogeneity but also enhances the recognition of new activities. LanHAR employs an iterative re-generation method to produce high-quality semantic interpretations with LLMs and a two-stage training framework that bridges the semantic interpretations of sensor readings and activity labels. This ultimately leads to a lightweight sensor encoder suitable for mobile deployment, enabling any sensor reading to be mapped into the semantic interpretation space. Experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both cross-dataset HAR and new activity recognition. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/DASHLab/LanHAR.</p></details> |  |

However, their adoption often relies on informal experimentation rather than structured guidance. \textit{Aims:} This study investigates how software testing professionals use LLMs in practice to propose a preliminary, practitioner-informed guideline to support their integration into testing workflows. \textit{Method:} We conducted a qualitative study with 15 software testers from diverse roles and domains. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed using grounded theory-based processes focused on thematic analysis. \textit{Results:} Testers described an iterative and reflective process that included defining testing objectives, applying prompt engineering strategies, refining prompts, evaluating outputs, and learning over time. They emphasized the need for human oversight and careful validation, especially due to known limitations of LLMs such as hallucinations and inconsistent reasoning. \textit{Conclusions:} LLM adoption in software testing is growing, but remains shaped by evolving practices and caution around risks. This study offers a starting point for structuring LLM use in testing contexts and invites future research to refine these practices across teams, tools, and tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mamba4Net: Distilled Hybrid Mamba Large Language Models For Networking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17147v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in networking research to address domain-specific challenges. However, their quadratic time complexity and substantial model sizes often result in significant computational overhead and memory constraints, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Drawing inspiration from the efficiency and performance of the Deepseek-R1 model within the knowledge distillation paradigm, this paper introduces Mamba4Net, a novel cross-architecture distillation framework. Mamba4Net transfers networking-specific knowledge from transformer-based LLMs to student models built on the Mamba architecture, which features linear time complexity. This design substantially enhances computational efficiency compared to the quadratic complexity of transformer-based models, while the reduced model size further minimizes computational demands, improving overall performance and resource utilization. To evaluate its effectiveness, Mamba4Net was tested across three diverse networking tasks: viewport prediction, adaptive bitrate streaming, and cluster job scheduling. Compared to existing methods that do not leverage LLMs, Mamba4Net demonstrates superior task performance. Furthermore, relative to direct applications of transformer-based LLMs, it achieves significant efficiency gains, including a throughput 3.96 times higher and a storage footprint of only 5.48% of that required by previous LLM-based approaches. These results highlight Mamba4Net's potential to enable the cost-effective application of LLM-derived knowledge in networking contexts. The source code is openly available to support further research and development.</p></details> |  |

Classical rule-based approaches offer explainability but lack adaptability, while deep learning methods provide predictive power at the cost of transparency, efficiency, and physical plausibility. Recent attempts to use Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection improve interpretability but largely ignore the physical principles that govern HVAC operations. We present PILLM, a Physics-Informed LLM framework that operates within an evolutionary loop to automatically generate, evaluate, and refine anomaly detection rules. Our approach introduces physics-informed reflection and crossover operators that embed thermodynamic and control-theoretic constraints, enabling rules that are both adaptive and physically grounded. Experiments on the public Building Fault Detection dataset show that PILLM achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing diagnostic rules that are interpretable and actionable, advancing trustworthy and deployable AI for smart building systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Workshop of UrbanAI (Oral)</p></details> |

This study investigates how LLMs handle emotional content and maintain semantic relationships through continuation and response tasks using three open-source models: Gemma, Llama3 and Llama3.3 and one commercial Model:Claude. By analyzing climate change discussions from Twitter and Reddit, we examine emotional transitions, intensity patterns, and semantic consistency between human-authored and LLM-generated content. Our findings reveal that while both models maintain high semantic coherence, they exhibit distinct emotional patterns: these models show a strong tendency to moderate negative emotions. When the input text carries negative emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, or sadness, LLM tends to generate content with more neutral emotions, or even convert them into positive emotions such as joy or surprise. At the same time, we compared the LLM-generated content with human-authored content. The four models systematically generated responses with reduced emotional intensity and showed a preference for neutral rational emotions in the response task. In addition, these models all maintained a high semantic similarity with the original text, although their performance in the continuation task and the response task was different. These findings provide deep insights into the emotion and semantic processing capabilities of LLM, which are of great significance for its deployment in social media environments and human-computer interaction design.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) 2026 (Los Angeles, California, U.S.)</p></details> |

These systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations. A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer electronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics 2025</p></details> |

However, Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to limitations in perceiving abstract graphics. To tackle this issue, we investigate the bottlenecks in current MLLMs and synthesize training data to improve their abstract visual perception. First, we propose VisuRiddles, a benchmark for AVR, featuring tasks meticulously constructed to assess models' reasoning capacities across five core dimensions and two high-level reasoning categories. Second, we introduce the Perceptual Riddle Synthesizer (PRS), an automated framework for generating riddles with fine-grained perceptual descriptions. PRS not only generates valuable training data for abstract graphics but also provides fine-grained perceptual description, crucially allowing for supervision over intermediate reasoning stages and thereby improving both training efficacy and model interpretability. Our extensive experimental results on VisuRiddles empirically validate that fine-grained visual perception is the principal bottleneck and our synthesis framework markedly enhances the performance of contemporary MLLMs on these challenging tasks. Our code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/yh-hust/VisuRiddles</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

Existing post-training alignment methods, such as SFT and RLHF, reduce harmful outputs yet leave LLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, especially advanced optimization-based ones. Recent system-2 approaches enhance safety by adding inference-time reasoning, where models assess potential risks before producing responses. However, we find these methods fail against powerful out-of-distribution jailbreaks, such as AutoDAN-Turbo and Adversarial Reasoning, which conceal malicious goals behind seemingly benign prompts. We observe that all jailbreaks ultimately aim to embed a core malicious intent, suggesting that extracting this intent is key to defense. To this end, we propose ARMOR, which introduces a structured three-step reasoning pipeline: (1) analyze jailbreak strategies from an external, updatable strategy library, (2) extract the core intent, and (3) apply policy-based safety verification. We further develop ARMOR-Think, which decouples safety reasoning from general reasoning to improve both robustness and utility. Evaluations on advanced optimization-based jailbreaks and safety benchmarks show that ARMOR achieves state-of-the-art safety performance, with an average harmful rate of 0.002 and an attack success rate of 0.06 against advanced optimization-based jailbreaks, far below other reasoning-based models. Moreover, ARMOR demonstrates strong generalization to unseen jailbreak strategies, reducing their success rate to zero. These highlight ARMOR's effectiveness in defending against OOD jailbreak attacks, offering a practical path toward secure and reliable LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional alignment methods often require retraining large pretrained models, making it difficult to quickly adapt and optimize LLMs for diverse applications. To address this limitation, we propose a novel \textit{Residual Alignment Model} (\textit{RAM}) that formalizes the alignment process as a type of importance sampling. In this framework, the unaligned upstream model serves as the proposal distribution, while the alignment process is framed as secondary sampling based on an autoregressive alignment module that acts as an estimator of the importance weights. This design enables a natural detachment of the alignment module from the target aligned model, improving flexibility and scalability. Based on this model, we derive an efficient sequence-level training strategy for the alignment module, which operates independently of the proposal module. Additionally, we develop a resampling algorithm with iterative token-level decoding to address the common first-token latency issue in comparable methods. Experimental evaluations on two leading open-source LLMs across diverse tasks, including instruction following, domain adaptation, and preference optimization, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025, 28 pages</p></details> |

Recommending and advertising games to users hinges on capturing their interest in games. However, existing representation learning methods crafted for handling billions of items in recommendation systems are unsuitable for game advertising and recommendation. This is primarily due to game sparsity, where the mere hundreds of games fall short for large-scale user representation learning, and game imbalance, where user behaviors are overwhelmingly dominated by a handful of popular games. To address the sparsity issue, we introduce the User Game Lifecycle (UGL), designed to enrich user behaviors in games. Additionally, we propose two innovative strategies aimed at manipulating user behaviors to more effectively extract both short and long-term interests. To tackle the game imbalance challenge, we present an Inverse Probability Masking strategy for UGL representation learning. The offline and online experimental results demonstrate that the UGL representations significantly enhance model by achieving a 1.83% AUC offline increase on average and a 21.67% CVR online increase on average for game advertising and a 0.5% AUC offline increase and a 0.82% ARPU online increase for in-game item recommendation.</p></details> |  |

The resulting hierarchical structure significantly reduces redundancy and improves information accessibility. We also propose dedicated taxonomy evaluation metrics to enable comprehensive assessment. Evaluations conducted on three diverse datasets demonstrate LLMTaxo's effectiveness in producing clear, coherent, and comprehensive taxonomies.

In human societies, value similarity is important for building trust and close relationships; however, it remains unexplored whether this principle holds true in artificial societies comprising LLM agents. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among LLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we evaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective model and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main experiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and analyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness following a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to investigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents with higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal closeness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a valid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the mechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a foundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.</p></details> |  |

However, annotating these signatures-especially those involving poorly characterized genes-remains a major challenge. Traditional methods, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), depend on well-curated annotations and often perform poorly in these contexts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but struggle to represent complex biological knowledge within structured ontologies. To address this, we present BRAINCELL-AID (BRAINCELL-AID: https://biodataai.uth.edu/BRAINCELL-AID), a novel multi-agent AI system that integrates free-text descriptions with ontology labels to enable more accurate and robust gene set annotation. By incorporating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we developed a robust agentic workflow that refines predictions using relevant PubMed literature, reducing hallucinations and enhancing interpretability. Using this workflow, we achieved correct annotations for 77% of mouse gene sets among their top predictions. Applying this approach, we annotated 5,322 brain cell clusters from the comprehensive mouse brain cell atlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, enabling novel insights into brain cell function by identifying region-specific gene co-expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles. BRAINCELL-AID also identifies Basal Ganglia-related cell types with neurologically meaningful descriptions. Hence, we create a valuable resource to support community-driven cell type annotation.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

The benchmark covers 100 brands (12 categories) and three prompt types (Insights, Ideas, Wild Ideas). Human pairwise preferences from 678 practising creatives over 11,012 anonymised comparisons, analysed with Bradley-Terry models, show tightly clustered performance with no model dominating across brands or prompt types: the top-bottom spread is $\Delta\theta \approx 0.45$, which implies a head-to-head win probability of $0.61$; the highest-rated model beats the lowest only about $61\%$ of the time. We also analyse model diversity using cosine distances to capture intra- and inter-model variation and sensitivity to prompt reframing. Comparing three LLM-as-judge setups with human rankings reveals weak, inconsistent correlations and judge-specific biases, underscoring that automated judges cannot substitute for human evaluation. Conventional creativity tests also transfer only partially to brand-constrained tasks. Overall, the results highlight the need for expert human evaluation and diversity-aware workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 Pa...</summary><p>30 Pages, 14 figures.

| **[System Prompt Poisoning: Persistent Attacks on Large Language Models Beyond User Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06493v3)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread adoption across diverse applications due to their impressive generative capabilities. Their plug-and-play nature enables both developers and end users to interact with these models through simple prompts. However, as LLMs become more integrated into various systems in diverse domains, concerns around their security are growing. Existing studies mainly focus on threats arising from user prompts (e.g. prompt injection attack) and model output (e.g. model inversion attack), while the security of system prompts remains largely overlooked. This work bridges the critical gap. We introduce system prompt poisoning, a new attack vector against LLMs that, unlike traditional user prompt injection, poisons system prompts hence persistently impacts all subsequent user interactions and model responses. We systematically investigate four practical attack strategies in various poisoning scenarios. Through demonstration on both generative and reasoning LLMs, we show that system prompt poisoning is highly feasible without requiring jailbreak techniques, and effective across a wide range of tasks, including those in mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, and natural language processing. Importantly, our findings reveal that the attack remains effective even when user prompts employ advanced prompting techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT). We also show that such techniques, including CoT and retrieval-augmentation-generation (RAG), which are proven to be effective for improving LLM performance in a wide range of tasks, are significantly weakened in their effectiveness by system prompt poisoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Large Language Model Inference with Neural Block Linearization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21077v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high inference demands of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) pose substantial challenges in their deployment. To this end, we introduce Neural Block Linearization (NBL), a novel framework for accelerating transformer model inference by replacing self-attention layers with linear approximations derived from Linear Minimum Mean Squared Error estimators. NBL leverages Canonical Correlation Analysis to compute a theoretical upper bound on the approximation error. Then, we use this bound as a criterion for substitution, selecting the LLM layers with the lowest linearization error. NBL can be efficiently applied to pre-trained LLMs without the need for fine-tuning. In experiments, NBL achieves notable computational speed-ups while preserving competitive accuracy on multiple reasoning benchmarks. For instance, applying NBL to 12 self-attention layers in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B increases the inference speed by 32% with less than 1% accuracy trade-off, making it a flexible and promising solution to improve the inference efficiency of LLMs. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/NBL.</p></details> |  |

Our framework mitigates risks by using an LLM to translate commands into a constrained Domain-Specific Language (DSL), which configures a custom Entity-Component-System (ECS) at runtime. We evaluated this system in a 2D spell-crafting game prototype by experimentally assessing models from the Gemini, GPT, and Claude families with various prompting strategies. A validated LLM judge qualitatively rated the outputs, showing that while larger models better captured creative intent, the optimal prompting strategy is task-dependent: Chain-of-Thought improved creative alignment, while few-shot examples were necessary to generate more complex DSL scripts. This work offers a validated LLM-ECS pattern for emergent gameplay and a quantitative performance comparison for developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figures (including appendix).

Compared to the celebrated higher-order orthogonal iterations (HOOI), HOQRI relies on a simple orthogonalization step in each iteration rather than a more sophisticated singular value decomposition step as in HOOI. More importantly, when dealing with extremely large and sparse data tensors, HOQRI completely eliminates the intermediate memory explosion by defining a new sparse tensor operation called TTMcTC (short for tensor times matrix chains times core). Furthermore, recognizing that the orthonormal constraints form a Cartesian product of Stiefel manifolds, we introduce the framework of manifold optimization and show that HOQRI guarantees convergence to the set of stationary points. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data showcase the effectiveness of HOQRI.</p></details> |  |

However, plenty of evidence points to the fact that LLMs lack basic linguistic competence in the vast majority of the world's 3800+ written languages. We introduce ChiKhaPo, consisting of 8 subtasks of varying difficulty designed to evaluate the lexical comprehension and generation abilities of generative models. ChiKhaPo draws on existing lexicons, monolingual data, and bitext, and provides coverage for 2700+ languages for 2 subtasks, surpassing any existing benchmark in terms of language coverage. We further show that 6 SOTA models struggle on our benchmark, and discuss the factors contributing to performance scores, including language family, language resourcedness, task, and comprehension versus generation directions. With ChiKhaPo, we hope to enable and encourage the massively multilingual benchmarking of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

A primary challenge here is the scarcity of data for training the LVLM - existing street-view datasets often contain numerous low-quality images lacking visual clues, and lack any reasoning inference. To address the data-quality issue, we devise a CLIP-based network to quantify the degree of street-view images being locatable, leading to the creation of a new dataset comprising highly locatable street views. To enhance reasoning inference, we integrate external knowledge obtained from real geo-localization games, tapping into valuable human inference capabilities. The data are utilized to train GeoReasoner, which undergoes fine-tuning through dedicated reasoning and location-tuning stages. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations illustrate that GeoReasoner outperforms counterpart LVLMs by more than 25% at country-level and 38% at city-level geo-localization tasks, and surpasses StreetCLIP performance while requiring fewer training resources. The data and code are available at https://github.com/lingli1996/GeoReasoner.</p></details> |  |

However, current evaluation paradigms primarily assess semantic performance, overlooking the critical question of resolution robustness - whether performance remains stable across varying input resolutions. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Res-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 14,400 samples across 12 resolution levels and six core capability dimensions. We designed a novel evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional accuracy metrics to capture performance stability. This framework introduces multiple robustness metrics: Spearman's correlation for assessing resolution-performance trends, and Absolute/Relative Continuous Error (ACE/RCE) for measuring performance volatility. Using these metrics, we conducted a large-scale evaluation of leading MLLMs. Our analysis encompasses: (1) model-centric and task-centric robustness examination, (2) investigation of preprocessing strategies including padding and super-resolution, and (3) exploration of fine-tuning for stability enhancement.</p></details> | 23 pages,19 figures |

We introduce SAKE, the first benchmark specifically designed for editing auditory attribute knowledge in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs). Unlike factual updates, SAKE targets several abstract auditory attributes, capturing knowledge types that go beyond conventional textual and visual domains. We benchmark seven editing methods on two LALMs along four dimensions: reliability, generality, audio/text locality, and portability. Results highlight challenges such as preserving intra-attribute knowledge unrelated to the edit, generalizing edits to multimodal reasoning, and maintaining edits under sequential updates. SAKE provides a principled framework to study how knowledge editing extends to the auditory modalities, opening new directions for maintaining and adapting LALMs in more diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> | Work in progress |

While their perception, reasoning, and task performance have been widely studied, their safety alignment under paralinguistic variation remains underexplored. This work systematically investigates the role of speaker emotion. We construct a dataset of malicious speech instructions expressed across multiple emotions and intensities, and evaluate several state-of-the-art LALMs. Our results reveal substantial safety inconsistencies: different emotions elicit varying levels of unsafe responses, and the effect of intensity is non-monotonic, with medium expressions often posing the greatest risk. These findings highlight an overlooked vulnerability in LALMs and call for alignment strategies explicitly designed to ensure robustness under emotional variation, a prerequisite for trustworthy deployment in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

Recent workflow-based data agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain fundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their reliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B, the first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of automatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to analyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science tasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates the learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to progressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world environments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework that constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training, DeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data question answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data research. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary LLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced, paving the way toward autonomous data science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/ruc-datalab/DeepAnalyze Model: https://huggingface.co/RUC-DataLab/DeepAnalyze-8B</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models are Powerful Electronic Health Record Encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17403v4)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer considerable potential for clinical prediction, but their complexity and heterogeneity present significant challenges for traditional machine learning methods. Recently, domain-specific EHR foundation models trained on large volumes of unlabeled EHR data have shown improved predictive accuracy and generalization. However, their development is constrained by limited access to diverse, high-quality datasets, and inconsistencies in coding standards and clinical practices. In this study, we explore the use of general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to encode EHR into high-dimensional representations for downstream clinical prediction tasks. We convert structured EHR data into Markdown-formatted plain-text documents by replacing medical codes with natural language descriptions. This enables the use of LLMs and their extensive semantic understanding and generalization capabilities as effective encoders of EHRs without requiring access to private medical training data. We show that LLM-based embeddings can often match or even surpass the performance of a specialized EHR foundation model, CLMBR-T-Base, across 15 diverse clinical tasks from the EHRSHOT benchmark. Critically, our approach requires no institution-specific training and can incorporate any medical code with a text description, whereas existing EHR foundation models operate on fixed vocabularies and can only process codes seen during pretraining. To demonstrate generalizability, we further evaluate the approach on the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort, out-of-domain for CLMBR-T-Base, whose fixed vocabulary covers only 16% of UKB codes. Notably, an LLM-based model achieves superior performance for prediction of disease onset, hospitalization, and mortality, indicating robustness to population and coding shifts.</p></details> |  |

To address this bottleneck, this paper proposes and validates a synergistic framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven data augmentation with an advanced encoder. We first demonstrate that data augmentation, optimized through a systematic evaluation of bi-directional and zero/few-shot prompting strategies, is highly effective, while the choice among leading LLMs is not a significant performance factor. Building on the augmented data, we further enhance an established, state-of-the-art pre-trained language model based method by incorporating an encoder distinguished by a broader pre-training corpus and an extended context window. Our experiments on four public datasets quantify the distinct contributions of our framework's components: on its own, data augmentation consistently improves the baseline method, providing substantial performance gains of up to 26.66%; incorporating the advanced encoder provides an additional lift of 2.21% to 11.25%. This synergy culminates in a fully optimized framework with maximum gains of up to 28.59% on $F_1$ score and 28.9% on $F_2$ score over the established baseline, decisively outperforming ten established baselines from three dominant paradigms. This work contributes a pragmatic and scalable methodology to overcome the data scarcity bottleneck, paving the way for broader industrial adoption of data-driven requirement-to-code traceability.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReefNet: A Large scale, Taxonomically Enriched Dataset and Benchmark for Hard Coral Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16822v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to anthropogenic pressures such as climate change, underscoring the urgent need for scalable, automated monitoring. We introduce ReefNet, a large public coral reef image dataset with point-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). ReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional site from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level hard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets, which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and (ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and conservation.</p></details> |  |

It also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way, we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage, given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models (LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/GeoCAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We investigate this question through entity comparison tasks by asking models to compare entities along numerical attributes (e.g., ``Which river is longer, the Danube or the Nile?''), which offer clear ground truth for systematic analysis. Despite having sufficient numerical knowledge to answer correctly, LLMs frequently make predictions that contradict this knowledge. We identify three heuristic biases that strongly influence model predictions: entity popularity, mention order, and semantic co-occurrence. For smaller models, a simple logistic regression using only these surface cues predicts model choices more accurately than the model's own numerical predictions, suggesting heuristics largely override principled reasoning. Crucially, we find that larger models (32B parameters) selectively rely on numerical knowledge when it is more reliable, while smaller models (7--8B parameters) show no such discrimination, which explains why larger models outperform smaller ones even when the smaller models possess more accurate knowledge. Chain-of-thought prompting steers all models towards using the numerical features across all model sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 20 figures.

| **[SpikingBrain: Spiking Brain-inspired Large Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05276v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length, and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware. Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM, and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms. SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior. For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4 percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and scalable large model design.</p></details> |  |

The LLM's outputs can inadvertently reveal information about the model's context, which presents a privacy challenge when the LLM is augmented via tools or databases containing sensitive information. Existing privacy-preserving methods at inference-time have significant limitations since they (i) lack provable guarantees or (ii) have a poor utility/privacy trade-off. We propose DP-Fusion, a Differentially Private Inference (DPI) mechanism for LLMs that provably bounds the influence a set of tokens in the context can have on the LLM's output. DP-Fusion works as follows: (1) label a subset of sensitive tokens, (2) infer the LLM without any sensitive tokens to obtain a baseline, (3) infer the LLM with the sensitive tokens, and (4) blend distributions so that the final output remains within a bounded distance of the baseline distribution. While this per-token influence bound also mitigates jailbreak-style prompt injection, we focus on \emph{document privatization}, where the goal is to paraphrase a document containing sensitive tokens, e.g., personally identifiable information, so that no attacker can reliably infer them from the paraphrased document while preserving high text quality. The privacy/utility trade-off is controlled by $\epsilon$, where $\epsilon=0$ hides sensitive tokens entirely, while higher values trade off privacy for improved text quality. We show that our method creates token-level provably privatized documents with substantially improved theoretical and empirical privacy, achieving $6\times$ lower perplexity than related DPI methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and data are publicly available here: https://github.com/MBZUAI-Trustworthy-ML/DP-Fusion-DPI</p></details> |

Generating court views is challenging due to the diversity and complexity of case facts, and directly generating from raw facts may limit performance. In this paper, we present ShiZhi, the first large language model (LLM) specifically designed for court view generation. We construct a Chinese Court View Generation dataset, CCVG, of more than 110K cases, each containing fact descriptions paired with corresponding court views. Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 70.00 ROUGE-1 and 67.85 BLEU-1 on court view generation, as well as 86.48\% accuracy with 92.75\% macro F1 on charge prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that even a small LLM can generate reasonable and legally coherent court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data.

This paper presents QuanBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on quantum code generation. QuanBench includes 44 programming tasks that cover quantum algorithms, state preparation, gate decomposition, and quantum machine learning. Each task has an executable canonical solution and is evaluated by functional correctness (Pass@K) and quantum semantic equivalence (Process Fidelity). We evaluate several recent LLMs, including general-purpose and code-specialized models. The results show that current LLMs have limited capability in generating the correct quantum code, with overall accuracy below 40% and frequent semantic errors. We also analyze common failure cases, such as outdated API usage, circuit construction errors, and incorrect algorithm logic. QuanBench provides a basis for future work on improving quantum code generation with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by ASE2025</p></details> |

However, existing MKGs often suffer from incompleteness, which hinder their effectiveness in downstream tasks. Therefore, multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) task is receiving increasing attention. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for knowledge graph completion (KGC), their application to the multimodal setting remains underexplored. Moreover, applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to the task of MKGC introduces significant challenges: (1) the large number of image tokens per entity leads to semantic noise and modality conflicts, and (2) the high computational cost of processing large token inputs. To address these issues, we propose Efficient Lightweight Multimodal Large Language Models (ELMM) for MKGC. ELMM proposes a Multi-view Visual Token Compressor (MVTC) based on multi-head attention mechanism, which adaptively compresses image tokens from both textual and visual views, thereby effectively reducing redundancy while retaining necessary information and avoiding modality conflicts. Additionally, we design an attention pruning strategy to remove redundant attention layers from MLLMs, thereby significantly reducing the inference cost. We further introduce a linear projection to compensate for the performance degradation caused by pruning. Extensive experiments on benchmark FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG demonstrate that ELMM achieves state-of-the-art performance while substantially improving computational efficiency, establishing a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge graph completion.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

This latent bias, known as sycophancy, manifests as a preference for user agreement over principled reasoning. We introduce Beacon, a single-turn forced-choice benchmark that isolates this bias independent of conversational context, enabling precise measurement of the tension between factual accuracy and submissive bias. Evaluations across twelve state-of-the-art models reveal that sycophancy decomposes into stable linguistic and affective sub-biases, each scaling with model capacity. We further propose prompt-level and activation-level interventions that modulate these biases in opposing directions, exposing the internal geometry of alignment as a dynamic manifold between truthfulness and socially compliant judgment. Beacon reframes sycophancy as a measurable form of normative misgeneralization, providing a reproducible foundation for studying and mitigating alignment drift in large-scale generative systems.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Low-Rank Query-based PDE Solver (LRQ-Solver), a physics-integrated framework engineered for rapid, accurate, and highly scalable simulations of industrial-grade models. This framework is built upon two primary technical innovations. First, our Parameter Conditioned Lagrangian Modeling (PCLM) approach explicitly couples local physical states with global design parameters, enabling robust predictions across varied simulation configurations. By embedding physical consistency directly into the learning architecture, PCLM ensures that predictions remain physically meaningful even under unseen design conditions, significantly enhancing generalization and reliability. Second, the Low-Rank Query Attention (LR-QA) module leverages the second-order statistics of physical fields to construct a global coherence kernel, reducing the computational complexity of attention from O(N2) to O(NC2 + C3). By replacing point-wise clustering with covariance decomposition, LRQ-Solver achieves exceptional scalability efficiently processing up to 2 million points on a single GPU. Validated on standard benchmarks, LRQ-Solver achieves a 38.9% error reduction on the DrivAerNet++ dataset and 28.76% on the 3D Beam dataset, alongside a training speedup of up to 50 times. Our results establish that LRQ-Solver offers a powerful paradigm for multi-configuration physics simulations, delivering a SOTA combination of accuracy, scalability, and efficiency.

Existing entry-wise penalties ignore cross-response dependence, while matrix-wise fusion over-couples clients. We propose a Sparse Row-wise Fusion (SROF) regularizer that clusters row vectors across clients and induces within-row sparsity, and we develop RowFed, a communication-efficient federated algorithm that embeds SROF into a linearized ADMM framework with privacy-preserving partial participation. Theoretically, we establish an oracle property for SROF-achieving correct variable-level group recovery with asymptotic normality-and prove convergence of RowFed to a stationary solution. Under random client participation, the iterate gap contracts at a rate that improves with participation probability. Empirically, simulations in heterogeneous regimes show that RowFed consistently lowers estimation and prediction error and strengthens variable-level cluster recovery over NonFed, FedAvg, and a personalized matrix-fusion baseline. A real-data study further corroborates these gains while preserving interpretability. Together, our results position row-wise fusion as an effective and transparent paradigm for large-scale personalized federated multivariate learning, bridging the gap between entry-wise and matrix-wise formulations.</p></details> |  |

As spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies proliferate, accurately identifying SVGs across diverse platforms, tissue types, and disease contexts has become both a major opportunity and a significant computational challenge. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of 20 state-of-the-art SVG detection methods using human slides from STimage-1K4M, a large-scale resource of ST data comprising 662 slides from more than 18 tissue types. We evaluate each method across a range of biologically and technically meaningful criteria, including recovery of pathologist-annotated domain-specific markers, cross-slide reproducibility, scalability to high-resolution data, and robustness to technical variation. Our results reveal marked differences in performance depending on tissue type, spatial resolution, and study design. Beyond benchmarking, we construct the first cross-tissue atlas of SVGs, enabling comparative analysis of spatial gene programs across cancer and normal tissues. We observe similarities between pairs of tissues that reflect developmental and functional relationships, such as high overlap between thymus and lymph node, and uncover spatial gene programs associated with metastasis, immune infiltration, and tissue-of-origin identity in cancer. Together, our work defines a framework for evaluating and interpreting spatial gene expression and establishes a reference resource for the ST community.</p></details> |  |
| **[FGBench: A Dataset and Benchmark for Molecular Property Reasoning at Functional Group-Level in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01055v3)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry. However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information. Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks. Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties, thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning, highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/xuanliugit/FGBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Datasets and Benchmarks Track)</p></details> |

In this paper, we explore the transformative effects of large-scale AI models on five major neuroscience domains: neuroimaging and data processing, brain-computer interfaces and neural decoding, molecular neuroscience and genomic modeling, clinical assistance and translational frameworks, and disease-specific applications across neurological and psychiatric disorders. These models are demonstrated to address major computational neuroscience challenges, including multimodal neural data integration, spatiotemporal pattern interpretation, and the derivation of translational frameworks for clinical deployment. Moreover, the interaction between neuroscience and AI has become increasingly reciprocal, as biologically informed architectural constraints are now incorporated to develop more interpretable and computationally efficient models. This review highlights both the notable promise of such technologies and key implementation considerations, with particular emphasis on rigorous evaluation frameworks, effective domain knowledge integration, and comprehensive ethical guidelines for clinical use. Finally, a systematic listing of critical neuroscience datasets used to derive and validate large-scale AI models across diverse research applications is provided.</p></details> |  |

The performance disparity among various populations can harm the model's robustness to sub-populations due to the varying user properties. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in enhancing RS performance, their practical applicability is hindered by high costs, inference latency, and degraded performance on long user queries. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid task allocation framework designed to promote social good by equitably serving all user groups. By adopting a two-phase approach, we promote a strategic assignment of tasks for efficient and responsible adaptation of LLMs. Our strategy works by first identifying the weak and inactive users that receive a suboptimal ranking performance by RSs. Next, we use an in-context learning approach for such users, wherein each user interaction history is contextualized as a distinct ranking task. We evaluate our hybrid framework by incorporating eight different recommendation algorithms and three different LLMs -- both open and close-sourced. Our results on three real-world datasets show a significant reduction in weak users and improved robustness to subpopulations without disproportionately escalating costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.00824</p></details> |
| **[Accelerated Learning on Large Scale Screens using Generative Library Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16612v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biological machine learning is often bottlenecked by a lack of scaled data. One promising route to relieving data bottlenecks is through high throughput screens, which can experimentally test the activity of $10^6-10^{12}$ protein sequences in parallel. In this article, we introduce algorithms to optimize high throughput screens for data creation and model training. We focus on the large scale regime, where dataset sizes are limited by the cost of measurement and sequencing. We show that when active sequences are rare, we maximize information gain if we only collect positive examples of active sequences, i.e. $x$ with $y>0$. We can correct for the missing negative examples using a generative model of the library, producing a consistent and efficient estimate of the true $p(y | x)$. We demonstrate this approach in simulation and on a large scale screen of antibodies. Overall, co-design of experiments and inference lets us accelerate learning dramatically.</p></details> |  |

This work explores a novel approach to phrase-structure analysis by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to translate an input sentence into its corresponding syntactic structure. The main objective is to extend the capabilities of MiSintaxis, a tool designed for teaching Spanish syntax. Several models from the Hugging Face repository were fine-tuned using training data generated from the AnCora-ES corpus, and their performance was evaluated using the F1 score.

However, research in this area has been persistently hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets, which are often limited in scale, disciplinary scope, and comparative analyses of different methodologies. To address this gap, we introduce FRONTIER-RevRec, a large-scale dataset constructed from authentic peer review records (2007-2025) from the Frontiers open-access publishing platform https://www.frontiersin.org/. The dataset contains 177941 distinct reviewers and 478379 papers across 209 journals spanning multiple disciplines including clinical medicine, biology, psychology, engineering, and social sciences. Our comprehensive evaluation on this dataset reveals that content-based methods significantly outperform collaborative filtering. This finding is explained by our structural analysis, which uncovers fundamental differences between academic recommendation and commercial domains. Notably, approaches leveraging language models are particularly effective at capturing the semantic alignment between a paper's content and a reviewer's expertise. Furthermore, our experiments identify optimal aggregation strategies to enhance the recommendation pipeline. FRONTIER-RevRec is intended to serve as a comprehensive benchmark to advance research in reviewer recommendation and facilitate the development of more effective academic peer review systems. The FRONTIER-RevRec dataset is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FRONTIER-RevRec-5D05.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Aligned Code Readability Assessment with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16579v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code readability is crucial for software comprehension and maintenance, yet difficult to assess at scale. Traditional static metrics often fail to capture the subjective, context-sensitive nature of human judgments. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable alternative, but their behavior as readability evaluators remains underexplored. We introduce CoReEval, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLM-based code readability assessment, comprising over 1.4 million model-snippet-prompt evaluations across 10 state of the art LLMs. The benchmark spans 3 programming languages (Java, Python, CUDA), 2 code types (functional code and unit tests), 4 prompting strategies (ZSL, FSL, CoT, ToT), 9 decoding settings, and developer-guided prompts tailored to junior and senior personas. We compare LLM outputs against human annotations and a validated static model, analyzing numerical alignment (MAE, Pearson's, Spearman's) and justification quality (sentiment, aspect coverage, semantic clustering). Our findings show that developer-guided prompting grounded in human-defined readability dimensions improves alignment in structured contexts, enhances explanation quality, and enables lightweight personalization through persona framing. However, increased score variability highlights trade-offs between alignment, stability, and interpretability. CoReEval provides a robust foundation for prompt engineering, model alignment studies, and human in the loop evaluation, with applications in education, onboarding, and CI/CD pipelines where LLMs can serve as explainable, adaptable reviewers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language over Content: Tracing Cultural Understanding in Multilingual Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16565v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across diverse cultural contexts, making accurate cultural understanding essential. Prior evaluations have mostly focused on output-level performance, obscuring the factors that drive differences in responses, while studies using circuit analysis have covered few languages and rarely focused on culture. In this work, we trace LLMs' internal cultural understanding mechanisms by measuring activation path overlaps when answering semantically equivalent questions under two conditions: varying the target country while fixing the question language, and varying the question language while fixing the country. We also use same-language country pairs to disentangle language from cultural aspects. Results show that internal paths overlap more for same-language, cross-country questions than for cross-language, same-country questions, indicating strong language-specific patterns. Notably, the South Korea-North Korea pair exhibits low overlap and high variability, showing that linguistic similarity does not guarantee aligned internal representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CIKM 2025 Workshop on Human Centric AI</p></details> |
| **[HCR-Reasoner: Synergizing Large Language Models and Theory for Human-like Causal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08750v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genuine human-like causal reasoning is fundamental for strong artificial intelligence. Humans typically identify whether an event is part of the causal chain first, and then influenced by modulatory factors such as morality, normality, and intention to make the final judgment. These two stages naturally map to the fields of 1) actual causality that provides formalisms for causal chain membership and 2) causal judgment from cognitive science that studies psychological modulators that influence causal selection. However, these two domains have largely been studied in isolation, leaving a gap for a systematic method based on LLMs. Therefore, we introduce HCR-Reasoner, a framework that systematically integrates the theory of actual causality and causal judgment into LLMs for human-like causal reasoning. It simulates humans by using actual causality formalisms to filter for structurally necessary candidate causes and causal judgment factors to determine the psychologically selected cause. For fine-grained evaluation, we introduce HCR-Bench, a challenging benchmark with 1,093 annotated instances with detailed reasoning steps. Results show HCR-Reasoner consistently and significantly improves LLMs' causal alignment with humans, and that explicitly integrating theory-guided reasoning into LLMs is highly effective for achieving faithful human-like causal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09992v3)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are widely regarded as relying on autoregressive models (ARMs). We challenge this notion by introducing LLaDA, a diffusion model trained from scratch under the pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) paradigm. LLaDA employs a forward data masking process and a reverse generation process, parameterized by a Transformer to predict masked tokens. It provides a principled generative approach for probabilistic inference by optimizing a likelihood lower bound. Across extensive benchmarks on general tasks, math, code, and so on, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability and performs comparably to our self-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive instruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue. Moreover, LLaDA addresses the reversal curse, surpassing GPT-4o in a reversal poem completion task. Our findings show the promise of diffusion models for language modeling at scale and challenge the common assumption that core LLM capabilities discussed above inherently depend on ARMs. Project page and codes: https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Label Multimodal Modeling of SNP Variants and ECG Phenotypes Using Large Language Models for Cardiovascular Risk Stratification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16536v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk stratification remains a major challenge due to its multifactorial nature and limited availability of high-quality labeled datasets. While genomic and electrophysiological data such as SNP variants and ECG phenotypes are increasingly accessible, effectively integrating these modalities in low-label settings is non-trivial. This challenge arises from the scarcity of well-annotated multimodal datasets and the high dimensionality of biological signals, which limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised models. To address this, we present a few-label multimodal framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to combine genetic and electrophysiological information for cardiovascular risk stratification. Our approach incorporates a pseudo-label refinement strategy to adaptively distill high-confidence labels from weakly supervised predictions, enabling robust model fine-tuning with only a small set of ground-truth annotations. To enhance the interpretability, we frame the task as a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning problem, prompting the model to produce clinically relevant rationales alongside predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of multimodal inputs, few-label supervision, and CoT reasoning improves robustness and generalizability across diverse patient profiles. Experimental results using multimodal SNP variants and ECG-derived features demonstrated comparable performance to models trained on the full dataset, underscoring the promise of LLM-based few-label multimodal modeling for advancing personalized cardiovascular care.</p></details> |  |

However, applying them to a stage that is unevenly reported and variably conducted carries important risks: misuse can amplify existing weaknesses and erode confidence in the SR findings. To examine the challenges of using LLMs for QS, we conducted a collaborative autoethnography involving two trials. We evaluated each trial for methodological rigor and practical usefulness, and interpreted the results through a technical lens informed by how LLMs are built and their current limitations.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we present ORAD-3D, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest dataset specifically curated for off-road autonomous driving. ORAD-3D covers a wide spectrum of terrains, including woodlands, farmlands, grasslands, riversides, gravel roads, cement roads, and rural areas, while capturing diverse environmental variations across weather conditions (sunny, rainy, foggy, and snowy) and illumination levels (bright daylight, daytime, twilight, and nighttime). Building upon this dataset, we establish a comprehensive suite of benchmark evaluations spanning five fundamental tasks: 2D free-space detection, 3D occupancy prediction, rough GPS-guided path planning, vision-language model-driven autonomous driving, and world model for off-road environments. Together, the dataset and benchmarks provide a unified and robust resource for advancing perception and planning in challenging off-road scenarios. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/chaytonmin/ORAD-3D.</p></details> | Off-road robotics |

However, their ability to solve more complex optimization problems - particularly NP-hard tasks - remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose NP-ENGINE, the first comprehensive framework for training and evaluating LLMs on NP-hard problems. NP-ENGINE covers 10 tasks across five domains, each equipped with (i) a controllable instance generator, (ii) a rule-based verifier, and (iii) a heuristic solver that provides approximate optimal solutions as ground truth. This generator-verifier-heuristic pipeline enables scalable and verifiable RLVR training under hierarchical difficulties. We also introduce NP-BENCH, a benchmark derived from NP-ENGINE-DATA, specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to tackle NP-hard level reasoning problems, focusing not only on feasibility but also on solution quality. Additionally, we present QWEN2.5-7B-NP, a model trained via zero-RLVR with curriculum learning on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, which significantly outperforms GPT-4o on NP-BENCH and achieves SOTA performance with the same model size. Beyond in-domain tasks, we demonstrate that RLVR training on NP-ENGINE-DATA enables strong out-of-domain (OOD) generalization to reasoning tasks (logic, puzzles, math, and knowledge), as well as non-reasoning tasks such as instruction following. We also observe a scaling trend: increasing task diversity improves OOD generalization. These findings suggest that task-rich RLVR training is a promising direction for advancing LLM's reasoning ability, revealing new insights into the scaling laws of RLVR.</p></details> |  |

This can exacerbate load fluctuations, compromise power quality, and pose risks to the grid's stability and security. However, due to their dual role as controllable loads and energy storage devices, EVs have the potential to mitigate these fluctuations, balance the variability of renewable energy sources, and provide ancillary services that support grid stability. By leveraging the bidirectional flow of information and energy in smart grids, the adverse effects of EV charging can be minimized and even converted into beneficial outcomes through effective real-time management strategies. This paper explores the negative impacts of EV charging on the distribution system's real-time operations and outlines methods to transform these challenges into positive contributions. Additionally, it provides an in-depth analysis of the real-time management system for EV charging, focusing on state estimation and management strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnTKV: Anchor Token-Aware Sub-Bit Vector Quantization for KV Cache in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19505v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization has emerged as an effective and lightweight solution to reduce the memory footprint of the KV cache in Large Language Models. Nevertheless, minimizing the accuracy degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV cache quantization remains a significant challenge. While scalar quantization is constrained by 1-bit bound, vector quantization exploits intra-vector correlations and enables sub-bit regimes, making it more suitable for ultra-low-bit quantization. To further mitigate quantization-induced degradation, we reveal that the degradation is highly uneven across tokens in attention quality. To investigate this unevenness, we introduce anchor score to measure each token's sensitivity to quantization. Our analysis and experiments show that preserving a small subset (1\%) of tokens with the highest Anchor Score significantly mitigates accuracy loss under aggressive quantization. We propose AnTKV, a dual-stage framework that leverages anchor token-aware vector quantization to compress the KV cache. It combines offline token-aware centroids learning and online anchor token selection to balance compression and accuracy. To enable efficient deployment, we design an online anchor token selection kernel compatible with FlashAttention. It allows LLaMA3-8B to scale to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100, while delivering up to $3.5\times$ higher decoding throughput over the FP16 baseline. Experiments demonstrate that AnTKV matches or surpasses prior methods at 4-bit, and significantly reduce perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization, achieving 6.32 at 1-bit on Mistral-7B, compared to 7.25 for CQ and 15.36 for KVQuant.</p></details> |  |

Among these, external TTS (particularly the Best-of-N selection paradigm) yields scalable performance improvements by selecting from multiple independently generated reasoning trajectories. However, this approach faces key limitations: (i) the high computational overhead of deploying process reward models, (ii) the underutilization of the LLM's intrinsic latent representations. We introduce TrajSelector, an efficient and effective Best-of-N framework that exploit the hidden states in the sampler LLM for process-level scoring. A lightweight verifier (with only 0.6B parameters) evaluates the quality of step-wise trajectory, and then aggregates these scores to identify the optimal reasoning trajectory. Our framework employs a fully data-driven, end-to-end training recipe that eliminates reliance on massive step-level annotations. Experiential results across five benchmarks demonstrate that TrajSelector delivers consistent performance gains. In Best-of-32 settings, it surpasses majority voting by 4.61% accuracy and outperforms existing process reward models by 4.31% to 12.21%, all while maintaining lower inference costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures.

| **[EDVD-LLaMA: Explainable Deepfake Video Detection via Multimodal Large Language Model Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16442v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of deepfake video technology has not only facilitated artistic creation but also made it easier to spread misinformation. Traditional deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection (EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model (MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT) to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset (ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios. Compared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior solution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[FrugalPrompt: Reducing Contextual Overhead in Large Language Models via Token Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16439v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) owe much of their stellar performance to expansive input contexts, yet such verbosity inflates monetary costs, carbon footprint, and inference-time latency. Much of this overhead manifests from the redundant low-utility tokens present in typical prompts, as only a fraction of tokens typically carries the majority of the semantic weight. We address this inefficiency by introducing FrugalPrompt, a novel prompt compression framework for LLMs, which retains only the most semantically significant tokens. Leveraging two state-of-the-art token attribution methods, GlobEnc and DecompX, we assign salience scores to every token in an input sequence, rank them to preserve the top-k% tokens in their original order, and obtain a sparse frugalized prompt. We evaluate the approach across four NLP tasks: Sentiment Analysis, Commonsense QA, Summarization, and Mathematical Reasoning, using a suite of frontier LLMs. For the first three tasks, a 20% prompt reduction incurs only a marginal loss in task performance, demonstrating that contemporary LLMs can reconstruct elided context from high-salience cues. In contrast, performance on mathematical reasoning deteriorates sharply, reflecting a stronger dependence on complete token continuity. Further analysis with bottom-k% and random-k% tokens reveals asymmetric performance patterns that may suggest potential task contamination effects, wherein models may resort to shallow memorized patterns from pretraining exposure for conventional NLP tasks. We posit that our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of LLM behavior in performance-efficiency trade-offs, and delineate the boundary between tasks tolerant to contextual sparsity and those requiring exhaustive context.

Current resources for cataract surgery often lack the diversity and annotation depth needed to train generalizable deep-learning models. To address this gap, we present a dataset of 3,000 phacoemulsification cataract surgery videos from two surgical centers, performed by surgeons with a range of experience levels. This resource is enriched with four annotation layers: temporal surgical phases, instance segmentation of instruments and anatomical structures, instrument-tissue interaction tracking, and quantitative skill scores based on the established competency rubrics like the ICO-OSCAR. The technical quality of the dataset is supported by a series of benchmarking experiments for key surgical AI tasks, including workflow recognition, scene segmentation, and automated skill assessment. Furthermore, we establish a domain adaptation baseline for the phase recognition task by training a model on a subset of surgical centers and evaluating its performance on a held-out center.

Therefore, it is essential to watermark LLMs to protect their copyright and trace unauthorized use or resale. Existing methods for watermarking LLMs primarily rely on training LLMs with a watermarked dataset, which entails burdensome training costs and negatively impacts the LLM's performance. In addition, their watermarked texts are not logical or natural, thereby reducing the stealthiness of the watermark. To address these issues, we propose EditMark, the first watermarking method that leverages model editing to embed a training-free, stealthy, and performance-lossless watermark for LLMs. We observe that some questions have multiple correct answers. Therefore, we assign each answer a unique watermark and update the weights of LLMs to generate corresponding questions and answers through the model editing technique. In addition, we refine the model editing technique to align with the requirements of watermark embedding. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive multi-round stable editing strategy, coupled with the injection of a noise matrix, to improve both the effectiveness and robustness of the watermark embedding. Extensive experiments indicate that EditMark can embed 32-bit watermarks into LLMs within 20 seconds (Fine-tuning: 6875 seconds) with a watermark extraction success rate of 100%, which demonstrates its effectiveness and efficiency. External experiments further demonstrate that EditMark has fidelity, stealthiness, and a certain degree of robustness against common attacks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a fast and computationally efficient dual-layer exploration planning method. The insight of our dual-layer method is efficiently finding an acceptable long-term region routing and greedily exploring the target in the region of the first routing area with high speed. Specifically, the proposed method finds the long-term area routing through an approximate algorithm to ensure real-time planning in large-scale environments. Then, the viewpoint in the first routing region with the lowest curvature-penalized cost, which can effectively reduce decelerations caused by sharp turn motions, will be chosen as the next exploration target. To further speed up the exploration, we adopt an aggressive and safe exploration-oriented trajectory to enhance exploration continuity. The proposed method is compared to state-of-the-art methods in challenging simulation environments. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of exploration efficiency, computational cost, and trajectory speed. We also conduct real-world experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code will be open-sourced.</p></details> | nothing |

This survey presents a comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs, from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270 pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands -- heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Whose Journey Matters? Investigating Identity Biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) for Travel Planning Assistance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17333v3)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integral to the hospitality and tourism industry, concerns about their fairness in serving diverse identity groups persist. Grounded in social identity theory and sociotechnical systems theory, this study examines ethnic and gender biases in travel recommendations generated by LLMs. Using fairness probing, we analyze outputs from three leading open-source LLMs. The results show that test accuracy for both ethnicity and gender classifiers exceed random chance. Analysis of the most influential features reveals the presence of stereotype bias in LLM-generated recommendations. We also found hallucinations among these features, occurring more frequently in recommendations for minority groups. These findings indicate that LLMs exhibit ethnic and gender bias when functioning as travel planning assistants. This study underscores the need for bias mitigation strategies to improve the inclusivity and reliability of generative AI-driven travel planning assistance.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenLVLM-MIA: A Controlled Benchmark Revealing the Limits of Membership Inference Attacks on Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16295v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>OpenLVLM-MIA is a new benchmark that highlights fundamental challenges in evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against large vision-language models (LVLMs). While prior work has reported high attack success rates, our analysis suggests that these results often arise from detecting distributional bias introduced during dataset construction rather than from identifying true membership status. To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are carefully balanced, and ground-truth membership labels are provided across three distinct training stages. Experiments using OpenLVLM-MIA demonstrated that the performance of state-of-the-art MIA methods converged to random chance under unbiased conditions. By offering a transparent and unbiased benchmark, OpenLVLM-MIA clarifies the current limitations of MIA research on LVLMs and provides a solid foundation for developing stronger privacy-preserving techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instant Personalized Large Language Model Adaptation via Hypernetwork](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16282v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized large language models (LLMs) tailor content to individual preferences using user profiles or histories. However, existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as the ``One-PEFT-Per-User'' (OPPU) paradigm, require training a separate adapter for each user, making them computationally expensive and impractical for real-time updates. We introduce Profile-to-PEFT, a scalable framework that employs a hypernetwork, trained end-to-end, to map a user's encoded profile directly to a full set of adapter parameters (e.g., LoRA), eliminating per-user training at deployment. This design enables instant adaptation, generalization to unseen users, and privacy-preserving local deployment. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms both prompt-based personalization and OPPU while using substantially fewer computational resources at deployment. The framework exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution users and maintains robustness across varying user activity levels and different embedding backbones. The proposed Profile-to-PEFT framework enables efficient, scalable, and adaptive LLM personalization suitable for large-scale applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distractor Injection Attacks on Large Reasoning Models: Characterization and Defense](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16259v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled remarkable performance on complex tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. In this paper, we identify and systematically analyze a critical vulnerability we term reasoning distraction, where LRMs are diverted from their primary objective by irrelevant yet complex tasks maliciously embedded in the prompt. Through a comprehensive study across diverse models and benchmarks, we show that even state-of-the-art LRMs are highly susceptible, with injected distractors reducing task accuracy by up to 60%. We further reveal that certain alignment techniques can amplify this weakness and that models may exhibit covert compliance, following hidden adversarial instructions in reasoning while concealing them in the final output. To mitigate these risks, we propose a training-based defense that combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic adversarial data, improving robustness by over 50 points on challenging distractor attacks. Our findings establish reasoning distraction as a distinct and urgent threat to LRM reliability and provide a practical step toward safer and more trustworthy reasoning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 9 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Sharp Large Deviations and Gibbs Conditioning for Threshold Models in Portfolio Credit Risk](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19151v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We obtain sharp large deviation estimates for exceedance probabilities in dependent triangular array threshold models with a diverging number of latent factors. The prefactors quantify how latent-factor dependence and tail geometry enter at leading order, yielding three regimes: Gaussian or exponential-power tails produce polylogarithmic refinements of the Bahadur-Rao $n^{-1/2}$ law; regularly varying tails yield index-driven polynomial scaling; and bounded-support (endpoint) cases lead to an $n^{-3/2}$ prefactor. We derive these results through Laplace-Olver asymptotics for exponential integrals and conditional Bahadur-Rao estimates for the triangular arrays. Using these estimates, we establish a Gibbs conditioning principle in total variation: conditioned on a large exceedance event, the default indicators become asymptotically i.i.d., and the loss-given-default distribution is exponentially tilted (with the boundary case handled by an endpoint analysis). As illustrations, we obtain second-order approximations for Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall, clarifying when portfolios operate in the genuine large-deviation regime. The results provide a transferable set of techniques-localization, curvature, and tilt identification-for sharp rare-event analysis in dependent threshold systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEME: Open Large Language Models for Ophthalmology with Advanced Reasoning and Clinical Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03740v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are poised to revolutionize healthcare. Ophthalmology-specific LLMs remain scarce and underexplored. We introduced an open-source, specialized LLM for ophthalmology, termed Language Enhanced Model for Eye (LEME). LEME was initially pre-trained on the Llama2 70B framework and further fine-tuned with a corpus of ~127,000 non-copyrighted training instances curated from ophthalmology-specific case reports, abstracts, and open-source study materials. We benchmarked LEME against eight other LLMs, namely, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, three Llama2 models (7B, 13B, 70B), PMC-LLAMA 13B, Meditron 70B, and EYE-Llama (another ophthalmology-specific LLM). Evaluations included four internal validation tasks: abstract completion, fill-in-the-blank, multiple-choice questions (MCQ), and short-answer QA. External validation tasks encompassed long-form QA, MCQ, patient EHR summarization, and clinical QA. Evaluation metrics included Rouge-L scores, accuracy, and expert evaluation of correctness, completeness, and readability. In internal validations, LEME consistently outperformed its counterparts, achieving Rouge-L scores of 0.20 in abstract completion (all p<0.05), 0.82 in fill-in-the-blank (all p<0.0001), and 0.22 in short-answer QA (all p<0.0001, except versus GPT-4). In external validations, LEME excelled in long-form QA with a Rouge-L of 0.19 (all p<0.0001), ranked second in MCQ accuracy (0.68; all p<0.0001), and scored highest in EHR summarization and clinical QA (ranging from 4.24 to 4.83 out of 5 for correctness, completeness, and readability). LEME's emphasis on robust fine-tuning and the use of non-copyrighted data represents a breakthrough in open-source ophthalmology-specific LLMs, offering the potential to revolutionize execution of clinical tasks while democratizing research collaboration.</p></details> |  |

However, recent work has largely focused on applying new methodology, such as reinforcement learning (RL), to training evaluators, shying away from large-scale, data-driven development. In this work, we focus on data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation tasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification, and single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With our data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family of 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative rejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges larger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for open-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static benchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers, FARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training, FARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs. string-matching verifiers. When initialized from FARE, a continually-finetuned FARE-Code outperforms gpt-oss-20B by 65% on evaluating test-case quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 9 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[UltraCUA: A Foundation Model for Computer Use Agents with Hybrid Action](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17790v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal agents for computer use rely exclusively on primitive actions (click, type, scroll) that require accurate visual grounding and lengthy execution chains, leading to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks. While other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers, tools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We present UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid action -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic tool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an automated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation, open-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine producing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use scenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection with both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4) a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online reinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and high-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA models achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while being 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on WindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming baselines trained on Windows data. The hybrid action mechanism proves critical, reducing error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speech Foundation Models Generalize to Time Series Tasks from Wearable Sensor Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00221v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Both speech and sensor time series data encode information in both the time- and frequency- domains, like spectral powers and waveform shapelets. We show that speech foundation models learn representations that generalize beyond the speech domain and achieve state-of-the-art performance on diverse time-series tasks from wearable sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0 outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on modality-specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and activity classification tasks. We find that the convolutional feature encoders of speech models are particularly relevant for wearable sensor applications. The proposed approach enhances performance on data-scarce time-series tasks using simple probing methods. This work takes a step toward developing generalized time-series models that unify speech and sensor modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |
| **[A Synthetic Data-Driven Radiology Foundation Model for Pan-tumor Clinical Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06171v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-assisted imaging made substantial advances in tumor diagnosis and management. However, a major barrier to developing robust oncology foundation models is the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets, which are limited by privacy restrictions and the high cost of manual labeling. To address this gap, we present PASTA, a pan-tumor radiology foundation model built on PASTA-Gen, a synthetic data framework that generated 30,000 3D CT scans with pixel-level lesion masks and structured reports of tumors across ten organ systems. Leveraging this resource, PASTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on 45 of 46 oncology tasks, including non-contrast CT tumor screening, lesion segmentation, structured reporting, tumor staging, survival prediction, and MRI-modality transfer. To assess clinical applicability, we developed PASTA-AID, a clinical decision support system, and ran a retrospective simulated clinical trial across two scenarios. For pan-tumor screening on plain CT with fixed reading time, PASTA-AID increased radiologists' throughput by 11.1-25.1% and improved sensitivity by 17.0-31.4% and precision by 10.5-24.9%; additionally, in a diagnosis-aid workflow, it reduced segmentation time by up to 78.2% and reporting time by up to 36.5%. Beyond gains in accuracy and efficiency, PASTA-AID narrowed the expertise gap, enabling less-experienced radiologists to approach expert-level performance. Together, this work establishes an end-to-end, synthetic data-driven pipeline spanning data generation, model development, and clinical validation, thereby demonstrating substantial potential for pan-tumor research and clinical translation.</p></details> | 63 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Intelligent Communication Mixture-of-Experts Boosted-Medical Image Segmentation Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17684v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models for medical image segmentation have achieved remarkable performance. Adaptive fine-tuning of natural image segmentation foundation models is crucial for medical image segmentation tasks. However, some limitations exist in existing fine-tuning methods: 1) insufficient representation of high-level features and 2) the fine-tuning process disrupts the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Inspired by these critical problems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts boosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold ideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts. Moreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which enables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load balancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained weights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address the issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning. This method further enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Extensive experiments across three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the IC-MoE outperforms other SOTA models. Consequently, the proposed IC-MoE effectively supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with high-level features and pretrained structural integrity. We also validate the superior generalizability of the IC-MoE across diverse medical image segmentation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[DELULU: Discriminative Embedding Learning Using Latent Units for Speaker-Aware Self-Supervised Speech Foundational Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17662v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised speech models have achieved remarkable success on content-driven tasks, yet they remain limited in capturing speaker-discriminative features critical for verification, diarization, and profiling applications. We introduce DELULU, a speaker-aware self-supervised foundational model that addresses this limitation by integrating external supervision into the pseudo-label generation process. DELULU leverages frame-level embeddings from ReDimNet, a state-of-the-art speaker verification model, to guide the k-means clustering step during pre-training, introducing a strong speaker-discriminative inductive bias that aligns representation learning with speaker identity. The model is trained using a dual objective that combines masked prediction and denoising, further enhancing robustness and generalization. DELULU significantly outperforms prior self-supervised learning (SSL) models across a range of speaker-centric tasks, achieving up to 62% relative improvement in equal error rate (EER) for speaker verification and consistent gains on zero-shot profiling tasks such as gender, age, accent, and speaker counting. Our findings demonstrate that DELULU is a strong universal encoder for speaker-aware speech processing, enabling superior performance even without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Transformers as Open-World Spatiotemporal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12164v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The urban environment is characterized by complex spatio-temporal dynamics arising from diverse human activities and interactions. Effectively modeling these dynamics is essential for understanding and optimizing urban systems. In this work, we introduce UrbanDiT, a foundation model for open-world urban spatio-temporal learning that successfully scales up diffusion transformers in this field. UrbanDiT pioneers a unified model that integrates diverse data sources and types while learning universal spatio-temporal patterns across different cities and scenarios. This allows the model to unify both multi-data and multi-task learning, and effectively support a wide range of spatio-temporal applications. Its key innovation lies in the elaborated prompt learning framework, which adaptively generates both data-driven and task-specific prompts, guiding the model to deliver superior performance across various urban applications. UrbanDiT offers three advantages: 1) It unifies diverse data types, such as grid-based and graph-based data, into a sequential format; 2) With task-specific prompts, it supports a wide range of tasks, including bi-directional spatio-temporal prediction, temporal interpolation, spatial extrapolation, and spatio-temporal imputation; and 3) It generalizes effectively to open-world scenarios, with its powerful zero-shot capabilities outperforming nearly all baselines with training data. UrbanDiT sets up a new benchmark for foundation models in the urban spatio-temporal domain. Code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UrbanDiT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLM as GNN: Graph Vocabulary Learning for Text-Attributed Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03313v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), where each node is associated with text descriptions, are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios. They typically exhibit distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning. PromptGFM comprises two key components: (1) Graph Understanding Module, which explicitly prompts LLMs to replicate the finest GNN workflow within the text space, facilitating seamless GNN-LLM integration and elegant graph-text alignment; (2) Graph Inference Module, which establishes a language-based graph vocabulary ensuring expressiveness, transferability, and scalability, enabling readable instructions for LLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority and transferability across diverse graphs and tasks. The code is available at this: https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptGFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deeper with Riemannian Geometry: Overcoming Oversmoothing and Oversquashing for Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17457v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) is the building block of graph foundation models, but fundamentally suffer from oversmoothing and oversquashing. There has recently been a surge of interest in fixing both issues. Existing efforts primarily adopt global approaches, which may be beneficial in some regions but detrimental in others, ultimately leading to the suboptimal expressiveness. In this paper, we begin by revisiting oversquashing through a global measure -- spectral gap $\lambda$ -- and prove that the increase of $\lambda$ leads to gradient vanishing with respect to the input features, thereby undermining the effectiveness of message passing. Motivated by such theoretical insights, we propose a \textbf{local} approach that adaptively adjusts message passing based on local structures. To achieve this, we connect local Riemannian geometry with MPNNs, and establish a novel nonhomogeneous boundary condition to address both oversquashing and oversmoothing. Building on the Robin condition, we design a GBN network with local bottleneck adjustment, coupled with theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments on homophilic and heterophilic graphs show the expressiveness of GBN. Furthermore, GBN does not exhibit performance degradation even when the network depth exceeds $256$ layers.</p></details> | Accept by NeurIPS 25 |
| **[From Spatial to Actions: Grounding Vision-Language-Action Model in Spatial Foundation Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17439v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models act in 3D real-world but are typically built on 2D encoders, leaving a spatial reasoning gap that limits generalization and adaptability. Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone. These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation, modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive baselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and variations in object scale and height.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://falcon-vla.github.io/</p></details> |

However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with strong correlations, we develop SymTime, a pre-trained foundation model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information. SymTime demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data scarcity and enhancing task performance.

However, conventional RAGs struggle to capture complex relationships between pieces of knowledge, limiting their performance in intricate reasoning that requires integrating knowledge from multiple sources. Recently, graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG) builds graph structure to explicitly model these relationships, enabling more effective and efficient retrievers. Nevertheless, its performance is still hindered by the noise and incompleteness within the graph structure. To address this, we introduce GFM-RAG, a novel graph foundation model (GFM) for retrieval augmented generation. GFM-RAG is powered by an innovative graph neural network that reasons over graph structure to capture complex query-knowledge relationships. The GFM with 8M parameters undergoes a two-stage training process on large-scale datasets, comprising 60 knowledge graphs with over 14M triples and 700k documents. This results in impressive performance and generalizability for GFM-RAG, making it the first graph foundation model applicable to unseen datasets for retrieval without any fine-tuning required. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets and seven domain-specific RAG datasets demonstrate that GFM-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency and alignment with neural scaling laws, highlighting its potential for further improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Combining ECG Foundation Model and XGBoost to Predict In-Hospital Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmias in AMI Patients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17172v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are a major cause of in-hospital death, yet early identification remains a clinical challenge. While traditional risk scores have limited performance, end-to-end deep learning models often lack the interpretability needed for clinical trust. This study aimed to develop a hybrid predictive framework that integrates a large-scale electrocardiogram (ECG) foundation model (ECGFounder) with an interpretable XGBoost classifier to improve both accuracy and interpretability. We analyzed 6,634 ECG recordings from AMI patients, among whom 175 experienced in-hospital VT/VF. The ECGFounder model was used to extract 150-dimensional diagnostic probability features , which were then refined through feature selection to train the XGBoost classifier. Model performance was evaluated using AUC and F1-score , and the SHAP method was used for interpretability. The ECGFounder + XGBoost hybrid model achieved an AUC of 0.801 , outperforming KNN (AUC 0.677), RNN (AUC 0.676), and an end-to-end 1D-CNN (AUC 0.720). SHAP analysis revealed that model-identified key features, such as "premature ventricular complexes" (risk predictor) and "normal sinus rhythm" (protective factor), were highly consistent with clinical knowledge. We conclude that this hybrid framework provides a novel paradigm for VT/VF risk prediction by validating the use of foundation model outputs as effective, automated feature engineering for building trustworthy, explainable AI-based clinical decision support systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trading with the Devil: Risk and Return in Foundation Model Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17165v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models - already transformative in domains such as natural language processing - are now starting to emerge for time-series tasks in finance. While these pretrained architectures promise versatile predictive signals, little is known about how they shape the risk profiles of the trading strategies built atop them, leaving practitioners reluctant to commit serious capital. In this paper, we propose an extension to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) that disentangles the systematic risk introduced by a shared foundation model - potentially capable of generating alpha if the underlying model is genuinely predictive - from the idiosyncratic risk attributable to custom fine-tuning, which typically accrues no systematic premium. To enable a practical estimation of these separate risks, we align this decomposition with the concepts of uncertainty disentanglement, casting systematic risk as epistemic uncertainty (rooted in the pretrained model) and idiosyncratic risk as aleatory uncertainty (introduced during custom adaptations). Under the Aleatory Collapse Assumption, we illustrate how Monte Carlo dropout - among other methods in the uncertainty-quantization toolkit - can directly measure the epistemic risk, thereby mapping trading strategies to a more transparent risk-return plane. Our experiments show that isolating these distinct risk factors yields deeper insights into the performance limits of foundation-model-based strategies, their model degradation over time, and potential avenues for targeted refinements. Taken together, our results highlight both the promise and the pitfalls of deploying large pretrained models in competitive financial markets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Models in Medical Image Analysis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16973v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly foundation models (FMs), have revolutionized medical image analysis, demonstrating strong zero- and few-shot performance across diverse medical imaging tasks, from segmentation to report generation. Unlike traditional task-specific AI models, FMs leverage large corpora of labeled and unlabeled multimodal datasets to learn generalized representations that can be adapted to various downstream clinical applications with minimal fine-tuning. However, despite the rapid proliferation of FM research in medical imaging, the field remains fragmented, lacking a unified synthesis that systematically maps the evolution of architectures, training paradigms, and clinical applications across modalities. To address this gap, this review article provides a comprehensive and structured analysis of FMs in medical image analysis. We systematically categorize studies into vision-only and vision-language FMs based on their architectural foundations, training strategies, and downstream clinical tasks. Additionally, a quantitative meta-analysis of the studies was conducted to characterize temporal trends in dataset utilization and application domains. We also critically discuss persistent challenges, including domain adaptation, efficient fine-tuning, computational constraints, and interpretability along with emerging solutions such as federated learning, knowledge distillation, and advanced prompting. Finally, we identify key future research directions aimed at enhancing the robustness, explainability, and clinical integration of FMs, thereby accelerating their translation into real-world medical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[FetalCLIP: A Visual-Language Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14807v3)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are becoming increasingly effective in the medical domain, offering pre-trained models on large datasets that can be readily adapted for downstream tasks. Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal and Transferable Attacks on Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16660v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance, we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset, but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.</p></details> | 38 Pages, 8 Figures |
| **[NeurIPT: Foundation Model for Neural Interfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16548v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) has wide-ranging applications, from clinical diagnosis to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). With the increasing volume and variety of EEG data, there has been growing interest in establishing foundation models (FMs) to scale up and generalize neural decoding. Despite showing early potential, applying FMs to EEG remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, as well as diverse electrode configurations across recording setups. To tackle these open challenges, we propose NeurIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse EEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG signals. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP), masking based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, to learn robust representations across varying signal intensities beyond local interpolation. Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a Progressive Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer of embedding across varying EEG settings, and develops Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling (IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features. Empirical evaluations across eight downstream BCI datasets, via fine-tuning, demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization. Our work pushes forward the state of FMs in EEG and offers insights into scalable and generalizable neural information processing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025).

The VGGSound dataset is commonly used as a benchmark for evaluation audio-visual classification. However, our analysis identifies several limitations of VGGSound, including incomplete labelling, partially overlapping classes, and misaligned modalities. These lead to distorted evaluations of auditory and visual capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VGGSounder, a comprehensively re-annotated, multi-label test set that extends VGGSound and is specifically designed to evaluate audio-visual foundation models. VGGSounder features detailed modality annotations, enabling precise analyses of modality-specific performance. Furthermore, we reveal model limitations by analysing performance degradation when adding another input modality with our new modality confusion metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025</p></details> |

Unlike prior studies that extrinsically analyze transcriptions produced by Whisper, our approach goes a step further to probe its latent capabilities by extracting acoustic and linguistic features from hidden representations. With only a lightweight classifier being trained on top of Whisper's intermediate and final outputs, our method achieves strong performance on the GEPT picture-description dataset, outperforming existing cutting-edge baselines, including a multimodal approach. Furthermore, by incorporating image and text-prompt information as auxiliary relevance cues, we demonstrate additional performance gains. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of Whisper's embeddings, which reveals that, even without task-specific fine-tuning, the model intrinsically encodes both ordinal proficiency patterns and semantic aspects of speech, highlighting its potential as a powerful foundation for SLA and other spoken language understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Contrastive Decoding for Robotic Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13255v4)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic foundation models, or generalist robot policies, hold immense potential to enable flexible, general-purpose and dexterous robotic systems. Despite their advancements, our empirical experiments reveal that existing robot policies are prone to learning spurious correlations from pre-training trajectories, adversely affecting their generalization capabilities beyond the training data. To tackle this, we propose a novel Policy Contrastive Decoding (PCD) approach, which redirects the robot policy's focus toward object-relevant visual clues by contrasting action probability distributions derived from original and object-masked visual inputs. As a training-free method, our PCD can be used as a plugin to improve different types of robot policies without needing to finetune or access model weights. We conduct extensive experiments on top of three open-source robot policies, including the autoregressive policy OpenVLA and the diffusion-based policies Octo and $\pi_0$. The obtained results in both simulation and real-world environments prove PCD's flexibility and effectiveness, e.g., PCD enhances the state-of-the-art policy $\pi_0$ by 8.9% in the simulation environment and by 108% in the real-world environment. Code and demos are publicly available at: https://Koorye.github.io/proj/PCD.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Scientific Large Language Models: From Data Foundations to Agent Frontiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21148v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs, from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270 pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands -- heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05545v3)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moral framing and sentiment can affect a variety of online and offline behaviors, including donation, environmental action, political engagement, and protest. Various computational methods in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have been used to detect moral sentiment from textual data, but achieving strong performance in such subjective tasks requires large, hand-annotated datasets. Previous corpora annotated for moral sentiment have proven valuable, and have generated new insights both within NLP and across the social sciences, but have been limited to Twitter. To facilitate improving our understanding of the role of moral rhetoric, we present the Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus, a collection of 16,123 English Reddit comments that have been curated from 12 distinct subreddits, hand-annotated by at least three trained annotators for 8 categories of moral sentiment (i.e., Care, Proportionality, Equality, Purity, Authority, Loyalty, Thin Morality, Implicit/Explicit Morality) based on the updated Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) framework. We evaluate baselines using large language models (Llama3-8B, Ministral-8B) in zero-shot, few-shot, and PEFT settings, comparing their performance to fine-tuned encoder-only models like BERT. The results show that LLMs continue to lag behind fine-tuned encoders on this subjective task, underscoring the ongoing need for human-annotated moral corpora for AI alignment evaluation.

However, evaluating these policies directly on physical robotic platforms such as the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) remains hindered by high costs, time demands, reproducibility challenges, and variability in execution. World foundation models (WFM) for physical AI offer a transformative approach to simulate complex real-world surgical tasks, such as soft tissue deformation, with high fidelity. This work introduces Cosmos-Surg-dVRK, a surgical finetune of the Cosmos WFM, which, together with a trained video classifier, enables fully automated online evaluation and benchmarking of surgical policies. We evaluate Cosmos-Surg-dVRK using two distinct surgical datasets. On tabletop suture pad tasks, the automated pipeline achieves strong correlation between online rollouts in Cosmos-Surg-dVRK and policy outcomes on the real dVRK Si platform, as well as good agreement between human labelers and the V-JEPA 2-derived video classifier. Additionally, preliminary experiments with ex-vivo porcine cholecystectomy tasks in Cosmos-Surg-dVRK demonstrate promising alignment with real-world evaluations, highlighting the platform's potential for more complex surgical procedures.</p></details> |  |

The approach leverages pathology-specific foundation model H-optimus-0, selected based on recent cross-domain generalization benchmarks and our empirical testing, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and MixUp augmentation. Implementation includes soft labels based on multi-expert consensus, hard negative mining, and adaptive focal loss, metric learning and domain adaptation. The method demonstrates both the promise and challenges of applying foundation models to this complex classification task, achieving reasonable performance in the preliminary evaluation phase.</p></details> |  |

As hypertension remains a global cause of morbidity and mortality, accurate, continuous, and non-invasive BP monitoring is therefore of paramount importance. Photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) can potentially enable continuous BP monitoring, yet training accurate and robust machine learning (ML) models remains challenging due to variability in data quality and patient-specific factors. Recently, multiple research groups explored Electroencephalographic (EEG)--based foundation models and demonstrated their exceptional ability to learn rich temporal resolution. Considering the morphological similarities between different biosignals, the question arises of whether a model pre-trained on one modality can effectively be exploited to improve the accuracy of a different signal type. In this work, we take an initial step towards generalized biosignal foundation models by investigating whether model representations learned from abundant EEG data can effectively be transferred to ECG/PPG data solely with fine-tuning, without the need for large-scale additional pre-training, for the BP estimation task. Evaluations on the MIMIC-III and VitalDB datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy for diastolic BP (mean absolute error of 1.57 mmHg) and surpasses by 1.5x the accuracy of prior works for systolic BP (mean absolute error 2.72 mmHg). Additionally, we perform dynamic INT8 quantization, reducing the smallest model size by over 3.5x (from 13.73 MB down to 3.83 MB) while preserving performance, thereby enabling unobtrusive, real-time BP monitoring on resource-constrained wearable devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables, Camera-ready, EMBC 2025</p></details> |

Robust EEG analytics have the potential to greatly improve patient care. However, traditional deep learning models, especially Transformer-based architectures, are hindered by their quadratic time and memory complexity, making them less suitable for resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we present FEMBA (Foundational EEG Mamba + Bidirectional Architecture), a novel self-supervised framework that establishes new efficiency benchmarks for EEG analysis through bidirectional state-space modeling. Unlike Transformer-based models, which incur quadratic time and memory complexity, FEMBA scales linearly with sequence length, enabling more scalable and efficient processing of extended EEG recordings. Trained on over 21,000 hours of unlabeled EEG and fine-tuned on three downstream tasks, FEMBA achieves competitive performance in comparison with transformer models, with significantly lower computational cost. Specifically, it reaches 81.82% balanced accuracy (0.8921 AUROC) on TUAB and 0.949 AUROC on TUAR, while a tiny 7.8M-parameter variant demonstrates viability for resource-constrained devices. These results pave the way for scalable, general-purpose EEG analytics in both clinical and highlight FEMBA as a promising candidate for wearable applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables, Camera-ready version, EMBC 2025</p></details> |

At its core, GE-Base is a large-scale, instruction-conditioned video diffusion model that captures the spatial, temporal, and semantic dynamics of real-world robotic interactions in a structured latent space. Built upon this foundation, GE-Act maps latent representations to executable action trajectories through a lightweight, flow-matching decoder, enabling precise and generalizable policy inference across diverse embodiments with minimal supervision. To support scalable evaluation and training, GE-Sim serves as an action-conditioned neural simulator, producing high-fidelity rollouts for closed-loop policy development. The platform is further equipped with EWMBench, a standardized benchmark suite measuring visual fidelity, physical consistency, and instruction-action alignment. Together, these components establish Genie Envisioner as a scalable and practical foundation for instruction-driven, general-purpose embodied intelligence.

| **[Information Theory in Open-world Machine Learning Foundations, Frameworks, and Future Direction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15422v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open world Machine Learning (OWML) aims to develop intelligent systems capable of recognizing known categories, rejecting unknown samples, and continually learning from novel information. Despite significant progress in open set recognition, novelty detection, and continual learning, the field still lacks a unified theoretical foundation that can quantify uncertainty, characterize information transfer, and explain learning adaptability in dynamic, nonstationary environments. This paper presents a comprehensive review of information theoretic approaches in open world machine learning, emphasizing how core concepts such as entropy, mutual information, and Kullback Leibler divergence provide a mathematical language for describing knowledge acquisition, uncertainty suppression, and risk control under open world conditions. We synthesize recent studies into three major research axes: information theoretic open set recognition enabling safe rejection of unknowns, information driven novelty discovery guiding new concept formation, and information retentive continual learning ensuring stable long term adaptation. Furthermore, we discuss theoretical connections between information theory and provable learning frameworks, including PAC Bayes bounds, open-space risk theory, and causal information flow, to establish a pathway toward provable and trustworthy open world intelligence. Finally, the review identifies key open problems and future research directions, such as the quantification of information risk, development of dynamic mutual information bounds, multimodal information fusion, and integration of information theory with causal reasoning and world model learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Models for Scientific Discovery: From Paradigm Enhancement to Paradigm Transition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15280v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and AlphaFold, are reshaping the landscape of scientific research. Beyond accelerating tasks such as hypothesis generation, experimental design, and result interpretation, they prompt a more fundamental question: Are FMs merely enhancing existing scientific methodologies, or are they redefining the way science is conducted? In this paper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific paradigm. We introduce a three-stage framework to describe this evolution: (1) Meta-Scientific Integration, where FMs enhance workflows within traditional paradigms; (2) Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, where FMs become active collaborators in problem formulation, reasoning, and discovery; and (3) Autonomous Scientific Discovery, where FMs operate as independent agents capable of generating new scientific knowledge with minimal human intervention. Through this lens, we review current applications and emerging capabilities of FMs across existing scientific paradigms. We further identify risks and future directions for FM-enabled scientific discovery. This position paper aims to support the scientific community in understanding the transformative role of FMs and to foster reflection on the future of scientific discovery.

Although foundation models achieve state-of-the-art predictive performance, their calibration properties remain relatively underexplored, despite the fact that calibration can be critical for many practical applications. In this paper, we investigate the calibration-related properties of five recent time series foundation models and two competitive baselines. We perform a series of systematic evaluations assessing model calibration (i.e., over- or under-confidence), effects of varying prediction heads, and calibration under long-term autoregressive forecasting. We find that time series foundation models are consistently better calibrated than baseline models and tend not to be either systematically over- or under-confident, in contrast to the overconfidence often seen in other deep learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Economics of AI Foundation Models: Openness, Competition, and Governance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15200v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The strategic choice of model "openness" has become a defining issue for the foundation model (FM) ecosystem. While this choice is intensely debated, its underlying economic drivers remain underexplored. We construct a two-period game-theoretic model to analyze how openness shapes competition in an AI value chain, featuring an incumbent developer, a downstream deployer, and an entrant developer. Openness exerts a dual effect: it amplifies knowledge spillovers to the entrant, but it also enhances the incumbent's advantage through a "data flywheel effect," whereby greater user engagement today further lowers the deployer's future fine-tuning cost. Our analysis reveals that the incumbent's optimal first-period openness is surprisingly non-monotonic in the strength of the data flywheel effect. When the data flywheel effect is either weak or very strong, the incumbent prefers a higher level of openness; however, for an intermediate range, it strategically restricts openness to impair the entrant's learning. This dynamic gives rise to an "openness trap," a critical policy paradox where transparency mandates can backfire by removing firms' strategic flexibility, reducing investment, and lowering welfare. We extend the model to show that other common interventions can be similarly ineffective. Vertical integration, for instance, only benefits the ecosystem when the data flywheel effect is strong enough to overcome the loss of a potentially more efficient competitor. Likewise, government subsidies intended to spur adoption can be captured entirely by the incumbent through strategic price and openness adjustments, leaving the rest of the value chain worse off. By modeling the developer's strategic response to competitive and regulatory pressures, we provide a robust framework for analyzing competition and designing effective policy in the complex and rapidly evolving FM ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design, and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM, the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry. DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases, imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation. Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised, self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable. DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address critical gaps in global oral healthcare.</p></details> |  |

However, compared to traditional GNNs, these LM-empowered GFMs introduce unique security vulnerabilities during the unsecured prompt tuning phase that remain understudied in current research. Through empirical investigation, we reveal a significant performance degradation in traditional graph backdoor attacks when operating in attribute-inaccessible constrained TAG systems without explicit trigger node attribute optimization. To address this, we propose a novel dual-trigger backdoor attack framework that operates at both text-level and struct-level, enabling effective attacks without explicit optimization of trigger node text attributes through the strategic utilization of a pre-established text pool. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our attack maintains superior clean accuracy while achieving outstanding attack success rates, including scenarios with highly concealed single-trigger nodes. Our work highlights critical backdoor risks in web-deployed LM-empowered GFMs and contributes to the development of more robust supervision mechanisms for open-source platforms in the era of foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Although existing methods resort to language models to learn unified semantic representations across domains, they disregard the unique structural characteristics of graphs from different domains. To address the problem, in this paper, we boost graph foundation model from structural perspective and propose BooG. The model constructs virtual super nodes to unify structural characteristics of graph data from different domains. Specifically, the super nodes fuse the information of anchor nodes and class labels, where each anchor node captures the information of a node or a graph instance to be classified. Instead of using the raw graph structure, we connect super nodes to all nodes within their neighborhood by virtual edges. This new structure allows for effective information aggregation while unifying cross-domain structural characteristics. Additionally, we propose a novel pre-training objective based on contrastive learning, which learns more expressive representations for graph data and generalizes effectively to different domains and downstream tasks. Experimental results on various datasets and tasks demonstrate the superior performance of BooG.

While the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) propels advancements in artificial general intelligence through their versatile capabilities, they still lack true any-to-any understanding and generation. Recently, the release of GPT-4o has showcased the remarkable potential of any-to-any LLMs for complex real-world tasks, enabling omnidirectional input and output across images, speech, and text. However, it is closed-source and does not support the generation of multimodal interleaved sequences. To address this gap, we present MIO, which is trained on a mixture of discrete tokens across four modalities using causal multimodal modeling. MIO undergoes a four-stage training process: (1) alignment pre-training, (2) interleaved pre-training, (3) speech-enhanced pre-training, and (4) comprehensive supervised fine-tuning on diverse textual, visual, and speech tasks. Our experimental results indicate that MIO exhibits competitive, and in some cases superior, performance compared to previous dual-modal baselines, any-to-any model baselines, and even modality-specific baselines. Moreover, MIO demonstrates advanced capabilities inherent to its any-to-any feature, such as interleaved video-text generation, chain-of-visual-thought reasoning, visual guideline generation, instructional image editing, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Oral).

This divide arises from fundamentally different training objectives, leading to mismatched strengths and inefficiency on simple queries, where both families tend to overthink or over-call tools. In this work, we present Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A$^2$FM), a unified framework that follows a route-then-align principle: the model first learns task-aware routing and then aligns mode-specific trajectories under a shared backbone. To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third mode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary reasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes. To jointly enhance accuracy and efficiency, we propose Adaptive Policy Optimization (APO), which enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies a cost-regularized reward. On the 32B scale, A$^2$FM achieves 13.4% on BrowseComp, 70.4% on AIME25, and 16.7% on HLE, setting new SOTA among comparable models and performing competitively with frontier LLMs across agentic, reasoning, and general benchmarks. Notably, the adaptive execution achieves a cost of pass of only $0.00487 per correct answer-cutting cost by 45.2% relative to reasoning and 33.5% relative to agentic, thus delivering substantially higher cost efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Falcon offers a unified, prompt-based paradigm that effectively executes comprehensive and complex remote sensing tasks. Falcon demonstrates powerful understanding and reasoning abilities at the image, region, and pixel levels. Specifically, given simple natural language instructions and remote sensing images, Falcon can produce impressive results in text form across 14 distinct tasks, i.e., image classification, object detection, segmentation, image captioning, and etc. To facilitate Falcon's training and empower its representation capacity to encode rich spatial and semantic information, we developed Falcon_SFT, a large-scale, multi-task, instruction-tuning dataset in the field of remote sensing. The Falcon_SFT dataset consists of approximately 78 million high-quality data samples, covering 5.6 million multi-spatial resolution and multi-view remote sensing images with diverse instructions. It features hierarchical annotations and undergoes manual sampling verification to ensure high data quality and reliability. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted, which verify that Falcon achieves remarkable performance over 67 datasets and 14 tasks, despite having only 0.7B parameters. We release the complete dataset, code, and model weights at https://github.com/TianHuiLab/Falcon, hoping to help further develop the open-source community.</p></details> |  |
| **[GauSSmart: Enhanced 3D Reconstruction through 2D Foundation Models and Geometric Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14270v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision, with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data. In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges 2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details. We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes. Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches, highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either approach alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalist vs Specialist Time Series Foundation Models: Investigating Potential Emergent Behaviors in Assessing Human Health Using PPG Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14254v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are pre-trained on massive amounts of data and can be adapted for various downstream tasks. They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis, particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather, traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51 tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability, robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the importance of training data choice.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing multimodal models remain constrained by autoregressive architectures, whose inherent limitations prevent a balanced integration of understanding and generation capabilities. Although hybrid and decoupling strategies have been explored to address these tasks within unified frameworks separately, their redundant, non-integrated designs limit their applicability to broader scenarios, such as cross-modal retrieval. In this work, we introduce NExT-OMNI, an open-source omnimodal foundation model that achieves unified modeling through discrete flow paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths and kinetic optimal velocities, NExT-OMNI natively supports any-to-any understanding and generation with enhanced response efficiency, while enabling broader application scenarios through concise unified representations rather than task-decoupled designs. Trained on large-scale interleaved text, image, video, and audio data, NExT-OMNI delivers competitive performance on multimodal generation and understanding benchmarks, while outperforming prior unified models in multi-turn multimodal interaction and cross-modal retrieval, highlighting its architectural advantages as a next-generation multimodal foundation model. To advance further research, we release training details, data protocols, and open-source both the code and model checkpoints.</p></details> |  |

We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs). Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification -- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks; and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Plasticity-Inspired Multimodal Foundation Model for Earth Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15356v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Earth observation (EO) in open-world settings presents a unique challenge: different applications rely on diverse sensor modalities, each with varying ground sampling distances, spectral ranges, and numbers of spectral bands. However, existing EO foundation models are typically tailored to specific sensor types, making them inflexible when generalizing across the heterogeneous landscape of EO data. To address this, we propose the Dynamic One-For-All (DOFA) model, a unified, multimodal foundation framework designed for diverse vision tasks in EO. Inspired by neural plasticity, DOFA utilizes a wavelength-conditioned dynamic hypernetwork to process inputs from five distinct satellite sensors flexibly. By continually pretraining on five EO modalities, DOFA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks and generalizes well to unseen modalities. Enhanced with hybrid continual pretraining, DOFA+ requires significantly fewer computational resources while outperforming counterparts trained with extensive GPU budgets. Experiments on diverse datasets highlight DOFA's potential as a foundation for general-purpose vision models in the sensor-diverse EO domain. The code and pre-trained weights are publicly available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/DOFA.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Unifying Polymer Modeling and Design via a Conformation-Centric Generative Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16023v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polymers, macromolecules formed from covalently bonded monomers, underpin countless technologies and are indispensable to modern life. While deep learning is advancing polymer science, existing methods typically represent the whole polymer solely through monomer-level descriptors, overlooking the global structural information inherent in polymer conformations, which ultimately limits their practical performance. Moreover, this field still lacks a universal foundation model that can effectively support diverse downstream tasks, thereby severely constraining progress. To address these challenges, we introduce PolyConFM, the first polymer foundation model that unifies polymer modeling and design through conformation-centric generative pretraining. Recognizing that each polymer conformation can be decomposed into a sequence of local conformations (i.e., those of its repeating units), we pretrain PolyConFM under the conditional generation paradigm, reconstructing these local conformations via masked autoregressive (MAR) modeling and further generating their orientation transformations to recover the corresponding polymer conformation. Besides, we construct the first high-quality polymer conformation dataset via molecular dynamics simulations to mitigate data sparsity, thereby enabling conformation-centric pretraining. Experiments demonstrate that PolyConFM consistently outperforms representative task-specific methods on diverse downstream tasks, equipping polymer science with a universal and powerful tool.</p></details> |  |
| **[Establishing a Foundation for Tetun Ad-Hoc Text Retrieval: Stemming, Indexing, Retrieval, and Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11758v6)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Searching for information on the internet and digital platforms requires effective retrieval solutions. However, such solutions are not yet available for Tetun, making it difficult to find relevant documents for search queries in this language. To address this gap, we investigate Tetun text retrieval with a focus on the ad-hoc retrieval task. The study begins with the development of essential language resources -- including a list of stopwords, a stemmer, and a test collection -- that serve as a foundation for Tetun text retrieval. Various strategies are evaluated using document titles and content. The results show that retrieving document titles, after removing hyphens and apostrophes but without applying stemming, improves performance compared to the baseline. Efficiency increases by 31.37%, while effectiveness achieves an average relative gains of +9.40% in MAP@10 and +30.35% in NDCG@10 with DFR BM25. Beyond the top-10 cutoff point, Hiemstra LM demonstrates strong performance across multiple retrieval strategies and evaluation metrics. The contributions of this work include the development of Labadain-Stopwords (a list of 160 Tetun stopwords), Labadain-Stemmer (a Tetun stemmer with three variants), and Labadain-Avaliad\'or (a Tetun test collection comprising 59 topics, 33,550 documents, and 5,900 qrels). These resources are publicly available to support future research in Tetun information retrieval.</p></details> | Pre-print version |
| **[Axial Neural Networks for Dimension-Free Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13665v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems. Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining for foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Foundation Models: Benchmarking Challenges and Requirements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13654v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) represent a new paradigm for time series forecasting, offering zero-shot forecasting capabilities without the need for domain-specific pre-training or fine-tuning. However, as with Large Language Models (LLMs), evaluating TSFMs is tricky, as with ever more extensive training sets, it becomes more and more challenging to ensure the integrity of benchmarking data. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation highlights multiple challenges, ranging from the representativeness of the benchmark datasets, over the lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, to risks of information leakage due to overlapping and obscure datasets, and the memorization of global patterns caused by external shocks like economic crises or pandemics. Our findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, risking inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to local time series. We argue for the development of robust evaluation methodologies to prevent pitfalls already observed in LLM and classical time series benchmarking, and call upon the research community to design new, principled approaches, such as evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data, to safeguard the integrity of TSFM assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Role of Computing Resources in Publishing Foundation Model Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13621v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cutting-edge research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) requires considerable resources, including Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), data, and human resources. In this paper, we evaluate of the relationship between these resources and the scientific advancement of foundation models (FM). We reviewed 6517 FM papers published between 2022 to 2024, and surveyed 229 first-authors to the impact of computing resources on scientific output. We find that increased computing is correlated with national funding allocations and citations, but our findings don't observe the strong correlations with research environment (academic or industrial), domain, or study methodology. We advise that individuals and institutions focus on creating shared and affordable computing opportunities to lower the entry barrier for under-resourced researchers. These steps can help expand participation in FM research, foster diversity of ideas and contributors, and sustain innovation and progress in AI.

While deep learning has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models (FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We introduce MedDINOv3, a simple and effective framework for adapting DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform domain-adaptive pretraining on CT-3M, a curated collection of 3.87M axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/ricklisz/MedDINOv3.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAR: Boosting Time Series Foundation Models for Anomaly Detection through State-aware Adapter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16014v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (MTSAD), however, in real-world industrial scenarios, many time series comprise not only numerical variables such as temperature and flow, but also numerous discrete state variables that describe the system status, such as valve on/off or day of the week. Existing TSFMs often overlook the distinct categorical nature of state variables and their critical role as conditions, typically treating them uniformly with numerical variables. This inappropriate modeling approach prevents the model from fully leveraging state information and even leads to a significant degradation in detection performance after state variables are integrated. To address this critical limitation, this paper proposes a novel STate-aware AdapteR (STAR). STAR is a plug-and-play module designed to enhance the capability of TSFMs in modeling and leveraging state variables during the fine-tuning stage. Specifically, STAR comprisesthree core components: (1) We design an Identity-guided State Encoder, whicheffectively captures the complex categorical semantics of state variables through a learnable State Memory. (2) We propose a Conditional Bottleneck Adapter, which dynamically generates low-rank adaptation parameters conditioned on the current state, thereby flexibly injecting the influence of state variables into the backbone model. (3) We also introduce a Numeral-State Matching module to more effectively detect anomalies inherent to the state variables themselves. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR can improve the performance of existing TSFMs on MTSAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[BrainOmni: A Brain Foundation Model for Unified EEG and MEG Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18185v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure neural activity non-invasively by capturing electromagnetic fields generated by dendritic currents. Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni, the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type, enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training yields consistent improvements across both modalities. Code and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/OpenTSLab/BrainOmni.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[SAIL-Embedding Technical Report: Omni-modal Embedding Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12709v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal embedding models aim to yield informative unified representations that empower diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite promising developments in the evolution from CLIP-based dual-tower architectures to large vision-language models, prior works still face unavoidable challenges in real-world applications and business scenarios, such as the limited modality support, unstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps. In this work, we introduce SAIL-Embedding, an omni-modal embedding foundation model that addresses these issues through tailored training strategies and architectural design. In the optimization procedure, we propose a multi-stage training scheme to boost the multifaceted effectiveness of representation learning. Specifically, the content-aware progressive training aims to enhance the model's adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and master enriched cross-modal proficiency. The collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement training further adapts multimodal representations for recommendation scenarios by distilling knowledge from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings while mining user historical interests. Concurrently, we develop the stochastic specialization and dataset-driven pattern matching to strengthen model training flexibility and generalizability. Experimental results show that SAIL-Embedding achieves SOTA performance compared to other methods in different retrieval tasks. In online experiments across various real-world scenarios integrated with our model, we observe a significant increase in Lifetime (LT), which is a crucial indicator for the recommendation experience. For instance, the model delivers the 7-day LT gain of +0.5% in the Douyin-Selected scenario. For the Douyin feed rank model, the match features produced by SAIL-Embedding yield a +0.1% AUC gain.</p></details> | Technical Report |

However, their capacity to memorize patient information raises important privacy concerns. In this work, we introduce a suite of black-box evaluation tests to assess privacy-related memorization risks in foundation models trained on structured EHR data. Our framework includes methods for probing memorization at both the embedding and generative levels, and aims to distinguish between model generalization and harmful memorization in clinically relevant settings. We contextualize memorization in terms of its potential to compromise patient privacy, particularly for vulnerable subgroups. We validate our approach on a publicly available EHR foundation model and release an open-source toolkit to facilitate reproducible and collaborative privacy assessments in healthcare AI.</p></details> |  |

The importance of these roles raise questions about how and what responses LLMs make in difficult political and moral domains, especially questions about possible biases. To quantify the nature of potential biases in LLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework that categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness, Ingroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to measure differences in human participants along political, national, and cultural lines. While there has been some analysis of the responses of LLM with respect to political stance in role-playing scenarios, no work so far has directly assessed the moral leanings in the LLM responses, nor have they connected LLM outputs with robust human data. In this paper we analyze the distinctions between LLM MFT responses and existing human research directly, investigating whether commonly available LLM responses demonstrate ideological leanings: either through their inherent responses, straightforward representations of political ideologies, or when responding from the perspectives of constructed human personas. We assess whether LLMs inherently generate responses that align more closely with one political ideology over another, and additionally examine how accurately LLMs can represent ideological perspectives through both explicit prompting and demographic-based role-playing. By systematically analyzing LLM behavior across these conditions and experiments, our study provides insight into the extent of political and demographic dependency in AI-generated responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Federated Fine-Tuning of Vision Foundation Models for Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12741v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare. However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients' privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals, clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive against current federated fine-tuning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Symposium on Model Accountability, Sustainability and Healthcare (SMASH) 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Philosophical Foundations of Growing AI Like A Child](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10742v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite excelling in high-level reasoning, current language models lack robustness in real-world scenarios and perform poorly on fundamental problem-solving tasks that are intuitive to humans. This paper argues that both challenges stem from a core discrepancy between human and machine cognitive development. While both systems rely on increasing representational power, the absence of core knowledge, foundational cognitive structures in humans, prevents language models from developing robust, generalizable abilities, where complex skills are grounded in simpler ones within their respective domains. It explores empirical evidence of core knowledge in humans, analyzes why language models fail to acquire it, and argues that this limitation is not an inherent architectural constraint. Finally, it outlines a workable proposal for systematically integrating core knowledge into future multi-modal language models through the large-scale generation of synthetic training data using a cognitive prototyping strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoRA: Covariate-Aware Adaptation of Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12681v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE) to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting. Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities, presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Use of Hierarchical Vision Foundation Models for Low-Cost Human Mesh Recovery and Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12660v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE). State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large, non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27 hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models. Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight alternatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCVW 2025</p></details> |

Accurate data-driven modeling of systems as ODEs, a central problem across the natural sciences, remains challenging, especially if the data is sparse or noisy. We introduce FIM-ODE (Foundation Inference Model for ODEs), a pretrained neural model designed to estimate ODEs zero-shot (i.e., in context) from sparse and noisy observations. Trained on synthetic data, the model utilizes a flexible neural operator for robust ODE inference, even from corrupted data. We empirically verify that FIM-ODE provides accurate estimates, on par with a neural state-of-the-art method, and qualitatively compare the structure of their estimated vector fields.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly, without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fast Coarse-graining and Equation Discovery with Foundation Inference Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12618v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g., the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple, simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.</p></details> |  |

This study benchmarks three foundation models for cereal crop mapping using hyperspectral imagery: HyperSigma, DOFA, and Vision Transformers pre-trained on the SpectralEarth dataset (a large multitemporal hyperspectral archive). Models were fine-tuned on manually labeled data from a training region and evaluated on an independent test region. Performance was measured with overall accuracy (OA), average accuracy (AA), and F1-score.

| **[General Demographic Foundation Models for Enhancing Predictive Performance Across Diseases and Populations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07330v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records. They are the most widespread information across populations and diseases, and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often treated as auxiliaries in model design, with limited attention being paid to learning their representations. This study explored the development of a General Demographic Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational model tailored to demographic attributes, focusing on age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with diverse diseases and populations compositions from different geographic regions. The composition of GDP architecture was explored through examining combinations of ordering approaches and encoding methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into effective latent embeddings. Results demonstrate the feasibility of GDP to generalize across task, diseases, and populations. In detailed composition, the sequential ordering substantially improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification. Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundation models for tabular demographic attributes offer a promising direction for improving predictive performance in healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Quantification for Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models: Foundations, Methodology, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12040v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of natural language processing, enabling breakthroughs across a wide range of areas including question answering, machine translation, and text summarization. Yet, their deployment in real-world applications has raised concerns over reliability and trustworthiness, as LLMs remain prone to hallucinations that produce plausible but factually incorrect outputs. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has emerged as a central research direction to address this issue, offering principled measures for assessing the trustworthiness of model generations. We begin by introducing the foundations of UQ, from its formal definition to the traditional distinction between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and then highlight how these concepts have been adapted to the context of LLMs. Building on this, we examine the role of UQ in hallucination detection, where quantifying uncertainty provides a mechanism for identifying unreliable generations and improving reliability. We systematically categorize a wide spectrum of existing methods along multiple dimensions and present empirical results for several representative approaches. Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising future research directions, providing a clearer picture of the current landscape of LLM UQ for hallucination detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 3 figures, magazine</p></details> |

Chest X-ray classification study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11553v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the training size necessary for specific ROC-AUC thresholds. Testing multiple pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50 baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential samples for targeted performance.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Yet, while self-supervised speech representation learning from raw waveforms has been remarkably successful, these approaches have not achieved similar feats for general-purpose audio representation learning from waveforms. Here, we propose WavJEPA, a waveform-based version of the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture. WavJEPA leverages high-level semantic representation learning to tackle the shortcomings of representation learning at the speech unit or token level. We show that this approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art time-domain audio foundation models across a wide variety of downstream benchmark tasks, while requiring considerably fewer computational resources. Additionally, to overcome the performance drop that time-domain models typically exhibit in noisy and reverberant real-world acoustic environments, we present WavJEPA-Nat. WavJEPA-Nat is a multi-channel extension of the WavJEPA architecture trained on simulated naturalistic scenes. We find that WavJEPA-Nat is highly robust to reverberation and noise. These results highlight the feasibility and computational efficiency of general-purpose audio representation learning from raw waveforms, showcasing the potential for low-latency, robust time-domain audio foundation models for real-world applications.</p></details> | Still under review |
| **[G2L:From Giga-Scale to Cancer-Specific Large-Scale Pathology Foundation Models via Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11176v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models, which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale) across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.</p></details> |  |
| **[Specialization after Generalization: Towards Understanding Test-Time Training in Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24510v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent empirical studies have explored the idea of continuing to train a model at test-time for a given task, known as test-time training (TTT), and have found it to yield significant performance improvements. However, there is limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task. Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most effective.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral at CCFM @ NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Fine-tuning (FT) is a method of customizing a pre-trained AI foundation model by further training it on a smaller, targeted dataset. In this paper, we initiate the study of the Privacy-Preserving Parameter-Efficient FT (P3EFT) framework, which can be viewed as the intersection of Parameter-Efficient FT (PEFT) and Privacy-Preserving FT (PPFT). PEFT modifies only a small subset of the model's parameters to achieve FT (i.e., adapting a pre-trained model to a specific dataset), while PPFT uses privacy-preserving technologies to protect the confidentiality of the model during the FT process. There have been many studies on PEFT or PPFT but very few on their fusion, which motivates our work on P3EFT to achieve both parameter efficiency and model privacy. To exemplify our P3EFT, we present the PrivTuner scheme, which incorporates Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enabled privacy protection into LoRA (short for ``Low-Rank Adapter''). Intuitively speaking, PrivTuner allows the model owner and the external data owners to collaboratively implement PEFT with encrypted data. After describing PrivTuner in detail, we further investigate its energy consumption and privacy protection. Then, we consider a PrivTuner system over wireless communications and formulate a joint optimization problem to adaptively minimize energy while maximizing privacy protection, with the optimization variables including FDMA bandwidth allocation, wireless transmission power, computational resource allocation, and privacy protection. A resource allocation algorithm is devised to solve the problem. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can significantly reduce energy consumption while adapting to different privacy requirements.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the Self-Supervised Dual-Path Prototypical Network (SS-DPPN), a foundation model for cardiac audio representation and classification from unlabeled data. The framework introduces a dual-path contrastive learning based architecture that simultaneously processes 1D waveforms and 2D spectrograms using a novel hybrid loss. For the downstream task, a metric-learning approach using a Prototypical Network was used that enhances sensitivity and produces well-calibrated and trustworthy predictions. SS-DPPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four cardiac audio benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional data efficiency with a fully supervised model on three-fold reduction in labeled data. Finally, the learned representations generalize successfully across lung sound classification and heart rate estimation. Our experiments and findings validate SS-DPPN as a robust, reliable, and scalable foundation model for physiological signals.</p></details> |  |

The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data and computational requirements associated with training video-language foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications. Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g., spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM, and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version, work in progress</p></details> |

We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically, we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training, vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent efficiency-performance trade-off.

| **[A Clinical-grade Universal Foundation Model for Intraoperative Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04861v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intraoperative pathology is pivotal to precision surgery, yet its clinical impact is constrained by diagnostic complexity and the limited availability of high-quality frozen-section data. While computational pathology has made significant strides, the lack of large-scale, prospective validation has impeded its routine adoption in surgical workflows. Here, we introduce CRISP, a clinical-grade foundation model developed on over 100,000 frozen sections from eight medical centers, specifically designed to provide Clinical-grade Robust Intraoperative Support for Pathology (CRISP). CRISP was comprehensively evaluated on more than 15,000 intraoperative slides across nearly 100 retrospective diagnostic tasks, including benign-malignant discrimination, key intraoperative decision-making, and pan-cancer detection, etc. The model demonstrated robust generalization across diverse institutions, tumor types, and anatomical sites-including previously unseen sites and rare cancers. In a prospective cohort of over 2,000 patients, CRISP sustained high diagnostic accuracy under real-world conditions, directly informing surgical decisions in 92.6% of cases. Human-AI collaboration further reduced diagnostic workload by 35%, avoided 105 ancillary tests and enhanced detection of micrometastases with 87.5% accuracy. Together, these findings position CRISP as a clinical-grade paradigm for AI-driven intraoperative pathology, bridging computational advances with surgical precision and accelerating the translation of artificial intelligence into routine clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equipping Vision Foundation Model with Mixture of Experts for Out-of-Distribution Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10584v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this, we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution. This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories, improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly outperforming baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact, surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks, notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations, such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other 2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>BHI a...</summary><p>BHI abstract extended</p></details> |

This paper explores a combined end-to-end architecture of pre-trained speech encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs) for performing both Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and ST simultaneously. Experiments with the English-to-German language pair show that our best model not only can achieve better translation results than SeamlessM4T, a large foundational end-to-end, multi-modal translation model, but can also match the performance of a cascaded system with Whisper and NLLB, with up to a score gain of 8% in $\text{COMET}^{\text{DA}}_{22}$ metric.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Perspectives: Foundation Model Guided BEV Maps for 3D Object Detection and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10287v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2 features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .</p></details> |  |

However, most existing studies have focused on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification. Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided, auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars, capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing GFM benchmarks, GenoArmory offers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks. Methodologically, we evaluate the adversarial robustness of five state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely adopted attack algorithms and three defense strategies. Importantly, our benchmark provides an accessible and comprehensive framework to analyze GFM vulnerabilities with respect to model architecture, quantization schemes, and training datasets. Additionally, we introduce GenoAdv, a new adversarial sample dataset designed to improve GFM safety. Empirically, classification models exhibit greater robustness to adversarial perturbations compared to generative models, highlighting the impact of task type on model vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks frequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that these models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.</p></details> |  |

We show that a set of five axioms--efficiency, linearity, symmetry, a modified null-player condition, and an independency principle--uniquely characterize this value across all coalitions, not just the grand coalition. In parallel, we derive a probabilistic representation interpreting each player's value as the expected cumulative marginal contribution along a random walk on the coalition graph. These dual axiomatic and probabilistic results unify fairness and stochastic interpretation, positioning the Hodge-theoretic value as a canonical generalization of Shapley's framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building a Foundational Guardrail for General Agentic Systems via Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09781v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While LLM agents can plan multi-step tasks, intervening at the planning stage-before any action is executed-is often the safest way to prevent harm, since certain risks can lead to severe consequences once carried out. However, existing guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale and leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To address this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research: data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce AuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii) injects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters outputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for pre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a foundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a compact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while Safiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales; trained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves robust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release Pre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching trajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization, explanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail over strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations further distill actionable practices, providing a practical template for safer agentic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Shared Prototypes for a Multimodal Pulse Motion Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09764v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling multi-modal time-series data is critical for capturing system-level dynamics, particularly in biosignals where modalities such as ECG, PPG, EDA, and accelerometry provide complementary perspectives on interconnected physiological processes. While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) advances have improved unimodal representation learning, existing multi-modal approaches often rely on CLIP-style contrastive objectives that overfit to easily aligned features and misclassify valid cross-modal relationships as negatives, resulting in fragmented and non-generalizable embeddings. To overcome these limitations, we propose ProtoMM, a novel SSL framework that introduces a shared prototype dictionary to anchor heterogeneous modalities in a common embedding space. By clustering representations around shared prototypes rather than explicit negative sampling, our method captures complementary information across modalities and provides a coherent "common language" for physiological signals. In this work, we focus on developing a Pulse Motion foundation model with ProtoMM and demonstrate that our approach outperforms contrastive-only and prior multimodal SSL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while offering improved interpretability of learned features.</p></details> |  |

This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts, yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable; (ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications. In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model, our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to 21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned, CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update: Corrected PDF rendering error on page 10 (caption of Figure 5 was previously overlapping with paper text)</p></details> |

Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and limited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a potential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated, with a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we propose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical image analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation tasks from diverse medical modalities. It is also the first CSAL benchmark that evaluates both the feature extraction and sample selection stages. Our experimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors for CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The performance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while small for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be considered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing Surprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for classification.

However, an important yet underexplored challenge is how to effectively finetune TSFMs on specific downstream tasks. While naive finetuning can yield performance gains, we argue that it falls short of fully leveraging TSFMs' capabilities, often resulting in overfitting and suboptimal performance. Given the diverse temporal patterns across sampling scales and the inherent multi-scale forecasting capabilities of TSFMs, we adopt a causal perspective to analyze finetuning process, through which we highlight the critical importance of explicitly modeling multiple scales and reveal the shortcomings of naive approaches. Focusing on encoder-based TSFMs, we propose Multiscale finetuning (MSFT), a simple yet general framework that explicitly integrates multi-scale modeling into the finetuning process. Experimental results on three different backbones (Moirai, Moment and Units) demonstrate that TSFMs finetuned with MSFT not only outperform naive and typical parameter efficient finetuning methods but also surpass state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation, coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods using VFMs leads to promising results.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks. MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task, obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular elucidation, and molecular design.

| **[SWE-Arena: An Interactive Platform for Evaluating Foundation Models in Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01860v5)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs), particularly large language models (LLMs), have shown significant promise in various software engineering (SE) tasks, including code generation, debugging, and requirement refinement. Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{SWE-Arena}, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SWE-Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including \emph{model consistency score} that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and \emph{conversation efficiency index} that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SWE-Arena incorporates a new feature called \emph{RepoChat}, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SWE-Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Check...</summary><p>Check the online arena at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SWE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena</p></details> |
