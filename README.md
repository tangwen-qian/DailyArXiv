This is typically achieved through visual representations of a virtual body; however, visual modalities are not always available, such as when users interact with agents using headphones or display-less glasses. In this work, we explore auditory embodiment. By introducing auditory cues of bodily presence - through spatially localized voice and situated Foley audio from environmental interactions - we investigate how audio alone can convey embodiment and influence perceptions of a conversational agent. We conducted a 2 (spatialization: monaural vs. spatialized) x 2 (Foley: none vs. Foley) within-subjects study, where participants (n=24) engaged in conversations with agents. Our results show that spatialization and Foley increase co-presence, but reduce users' perceptions of the agent's attention and other social attributes.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Particles to Agents: Hallucination as a Metric for Cognitive Friction in Spatial Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21977v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional architectural simulations (e.g. Computational Fluid Dynamics, evacuation, structural analysis) model elements as deterministic physics-based "particles" rather than cognitive "agents". To bridge this, we introduce \textbf{Agentic Environmental Simulations}, where Large Multimodal generative models actively predict the next state of spatial environments based on semantic expectation. Drawing on examples from accessibility-oriented AR pipelines and multimodal digital twins, we propose a shift from chronological time-steps to Episodic Spatial Reasoning, where simulations advance through meaningful, surprisal-triggered events. Within this framework we posit AI hallucinations as diagnostic tools. By formalizing the \textbf{Cognitive Friction} ($C_f$) it is possible to reveal "Phantom Affordances", i.e. semiotic ambiguities in built space. Finally, we challenge current HCI paradigms by treating environments as dynamic cognitive partners and propose a human-centered framework of cognitive orchestration for designing AI-driven simulations that preserve autonomy, affective clarity, and cognitive integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper selected for the workshop Human Cognition, AI, and the Future of HCI: Navigating the Disruptive and Wild Landscape of Large Language Models and Agentic AI as part of the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) conference of the Alpine region (AlpCHI 2026) hosted at the Congressi Stefano Franscini, March 1st to March 5th, 2026 on Monte Verità in Ascona, Switzerland</p></details> |
| **[RSGround-R1: Rethinking Remote Sensing Visual Grounding through Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21634v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote Sensing Visual Grounding (RSVG) aims to localize target objects in large-scale aerial imagery based on natural language descriptions. Owing to the vast spatial scale and high semantic ambiguity of remote sensing scenes, these descriptions often rely heavily on positional cues, posing unique challenges for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in spatial reasoning. To leverage this unique feature, we propose a reasoning-guided, position-aware post-training framework, dubbed \textbf{RSGround-R1}, to progressively enhance spatial understanding. Specifically, we first introduce Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) using synthetically generated RSVG reasoning data to establish explicit position awareness. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) is then applied, augmented by our newly designed positional reward that provides continuous and distance-aware guidance toward accurate localization. Moreover, to mitigate incoherent localization behaviors across rollouts, we introduce a spatial consistency guided optimization scheme that dynamically adjusts policy updates based on their spatial coherence, ensuring stable and robust convergence. Extensive experiments on RSVG benchmarks demonstrate superior performance and generalization of our model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Virtual Reflections on a Dynamic 2D Eye Model Improve Spatial Reference Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07344v4)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The visible orientation of human eyes creates some transparency about people's spatial attention and other mental states. This leads to a dual role of the eyes as a means of sensing and communication. Accordingly, artificial eye models are being explored as communication media in human-machine interaction scenarios. One challenge in the use of eye models for communication consists of resolving spatial reference ambiguities, especially for screen-based models. To address this challenge, we introduce an approach that incorporates reflection-like features that are contingent on the movements of artificial eyes. We conducted a user study with 30 participants in which participants had to use spatial references provided by dynamic eye models to advance in a fast-paced group interaction task. Compared to a non-reflective eye model and a pure reflection mode, the superimposition of screen-based eyes with gaze-contingent virtual reflections resulted in a higher identification accuracy and user experience, suggesting a synergistic benefit.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems.

| **[Everything in Its Place: Benchmarking Spatial Intelligence of Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20354v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-fidelity images, but they often fail in handling complex spatial relationships, e.g., spatial perception, reasoning, or interaction. These critical aspects are largely overlooked by current benchmarks due to their short or information-sparse prompt design. In this paper, we introduce SpatialGenEval, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial intelligence of T2I models, covering two key aspects: (1) SpatialGenEval involves 1,230 long, information-dense prompts across 25 real-world scenes. Each prompt integrates 10 spatial sub-domains and corresponding 10 multi-choice question-answer pairs, ranging from object position and layout to occlusion and causality. Our extensive evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art models reveals that higher-order spatial reasoning remains a primary bottleneck. (2) To demonstrate that the utility of our information-dense design goes beyond simple evaluation, we also construct the SpatialT2I dataset. It contains 15,400 text-image pairs with rewritten prompts to ensure image consistency while preserving information density. Fine-tuned results on current foundation models (i.e., Stable Diffusion-XL, Uniworld-V1, OmniGen2) yield consistent performance gains (+4.2%, +5.7%, +4.4%) and more realistic effects in spatial relations, highlighting a data-centric paradigm to achieve spatial intelligence in T2I models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026, URL: https://github.com/AMAP-ML/SpatialGenEval</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Spatialized Auditory Cues for Rapid Attention Capture in XR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21264v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time-critical eXtended reality (XR) scenarios where users must rapidly reorient their attention to hazards, alerts, or instructions while engaged in a primary task, spatial audio can provide an immediate directional cue without occupying visual bandwidth. However, such scenarios can afford only a brief auditory exposure, requiring users to interpret sound direction quickly and without extended listening or head-driven refinement. This paper reports a controlled exploratory study of rapid spatial-audio localization in XR. Using HRTF-rendered broadband stimuli presented from a semi-dense set of directions around the listener, we quantify how accurately users can infer coarse direction from brief audio alone. We further examine the effects of short-term visuo-auditory feedback training as a lightweight calibration mechanism. Our findings show that brief spatial cues can convey coarse directional information, and that even short calibration can improve users' perception of aural signals. While these results highlight the potential of spatial audio for rapid attention guidance, they also show that auditory cues alone may not provide sufficient precision for complex or high-stakes tasks, and that spatial audio may be most effective when complemented by other sensory modalities or visual cues, without relying on head-driven refinement. We leverage this study on spatial audio as a preliminary investigation into a first-stage attention-guidance channel for wearable XR (e.g., VR head-mounted displays and AR smart glasses), and provide design insights on stimulus selection and calibration for time-critical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures.

| **[SpatialV2A: Visual-Guided High-fidelity Spatial Audio Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15017v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While video-to-audio generation has achieved remarkable progress in semantic and temporal alignment, most existing studies focus solely on these aspects, paying limited attention to the spatial perception and immersive quality of the synthesized audio. This limitation stems largely from current models' reliance on mono audio datasets, which lack the binaural spatial information needed to learn visual-to-spatial audio mappings. To address this gap, we introduce two key contributions: we construct BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset designed to support spatially aware video-to-audio generation; and we propose a end-to-end spatial audio generation framework guided by visual cues, which explicitly models spatial features. Our framework incorporates a visual-guided audio spatialization module that ensures the generated audio exhibits realistic spatial attributes and layered spatial depth while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment. Experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial fidelity and delivers a more immersive auditory experience, without sacrificing temporal or semantic consistency.

| **[FireFly-S: Exploiting Dual-Side Sparsity for Spiking Neural Networks Acceleration with Reconfigurable Spatial Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15578v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with brain-inspired structure using discrete spikes instead of continuous activations, are gaining attention for their efficient processing on neuromorphic chips. While current SNN hardware accelerators often prioritize temporal spike sparsity, exploiting sparse synaptic weights offers significant untapped potential for even greater efficiency. To address this, we propose FireFly-S, a Sparse extension of the FireFly series. This co-optimized software-hardware design focuses on leveraging dual-side sparsity for acceleration. On the software side, we propose a algorithmic optimization framework that combines gradient rewiring for pruning and modified Learned Step Size Quantization (LSQ) for SNNs, achieving a weight sparsity exceeding 85\% and enabling efficient 4-bit quantization with negligible accuracy loss. On the hardware side, we present an efficient dual-side sparsity detector employing a Bitmap-based sparse decoding logic to pinpoint the positions of non-zero weights and input spikes. The logic allows for direct bypassing of redundant computations, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Different from the overlay architecture adopted by previous FireFly series, we adopt a parametric spatial architecture with inter-layer pipelining that can fully exploit the fine-grained programmability and reconfigurability of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), enabling fast deployment for various models. A spatial-temporal dataflow is also proposed to support such inter-layer pipelining and avoid long-term temporal dependencies. In experiments conducted on the MNIST, DVS-Gesture and CIFAR-10 datasets, the FireFly-S model achieves 85--95\% sparsity with 4-bit quantization and the hardware accelerator effectively leverages the dual-side sparsity, delivering performance metrics of 10,047~FPS/W on MNIST, 3,683~FPS/W on DVS-Gesture, and 2,327~FPS/W on CIFAR-10.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures.

| **[PhaseCoder: Microphone Geometry-Agnostic Spatial Audio Understanding for Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21124v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multimodal LLMs process audio as a mono stream, ignoring the rich spatial information essential for embodied AI. Existing spatial audio models, conversely, are constrained to fixed microphone geometries, preventing deployment across diverse devices. We present PhaseCoder, a transformer-only spatial audio encoder that is agnostic to microphone geometry. PhaseCoder takes raw multichannel audio and microphone coordinates as inputs to perform localization and produces robust spatial embeddings. We demonstrate that Gemma 3n LLM can be fine-tuned to reason over "Spatial Audio Tokens" produced by PhaseCoder. We show our encoder achieves state-of-the-art results on microphone-invariant localization benchmarks and, for the first time, enables an LLM to perform complex spatial reasoning and targeted transcription tasks from an arbitrary microphone array.</p></details> |  |
| **[DNN-Based Online Source Counting Based on Spatial Generalized Magnitude Squared Coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21114v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The number of active sound sources is a key parameter in many acoustic signal processing tasks, such as source localization, source separation, and multi-microphone speech enhancement. This paper proposes a novel method for online source counting by detecting changes in the number of active sources based on spatial coherence. The proposed method exploits the fact that a single coherent source in spatially white background noise yields high spatial coherence, whereas only noise results in low spatial coherence. By applying a spatial whitening operation, the source counting problem is reformulated as a change detection task, aiming to identify the time frames when the number of active sources changes. The method leverages the generalized magnitude-squared coherence as a measure to quantify spatial coherence, providing features for a compact neural network trained to detect source count changes framewise. Simulation results with binaural hearing aids in reverberant acoustic scenes with up to 4 speakers and background noise demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for online source counting.</p></details> | <details><summary>in Pr...</summary><p>in Proc.

| **[STEMS: Spatial-Temporal Mapping For Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03287v3)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising bio-inspired third-generation neural networks. Recent research has trained deep SNN models with accuracy on par with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Although the event-driven and sparse nature of SNNs show potential for more energy efficient computation than ANNs, SNN neurons have internal states which evolve over time. Keeping track of SNN states can significantly increase data movement and storage requirements, potentially losing its advantages with respect to ANNs. This paper investigates the energy effects of having neuron states, and how it is influenced by the chosen mapping to realistic hardware architectures with advanced memory hierarchies. Therefore, we develop STEMS, a mapping design space exploration for SNNs. STEMS models SNN's stateful behavior and explores intra-layer and inter-layer mapping optimizations to minimize data movement, considering both spatial and temporal SNN dimensions. Using STEMS, we show up to 12x reduction in off-chip data movement and 5x reduction in energy (on top of intra-layer optimizations), on two event-based vision SNN benchmarks. Finally, neuron states may not be needed for all SNN layers. By optimizing neuron states for one of our benchmarks, we show 20x reduction in neuron states and 1.4x better performance without accuracy loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 23 figures, under review at IEEE TC</p></details> |
| **[Effective Sample Size for Functional Spatial Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20812v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effective sample size quantifies the amount of independent information contained in a dataset, accounting for redundancy due to correlation between observations. While widely used in geostatistics for scalar data, its extension to functional spatial data has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel definition of the effective sample size for functional geostatistical data, employing the trace-covariogram as a measure of correlation, and show that it retains the intuitive properties of the classical scalar ESS. We illustrate the behavior of this measure using a functional autoregressive process, demonstrating how serial dependence and the allocation of variability across eigen-directions influence the resulting functional ESS. Finally, the approach is applied to a real meteorological dataset of geometric vertical velocities over a portion of the Earth, showing how the method can quantify redundancy and determine the effective number of independent curves in functional spatial datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[MVAR: Visual Autoregressive Modeling with Scale and Spatial Markovian Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12742v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Essential to visual generation is efficient modeling of visual data priors. Conventional next-token prediction methods define the process as learning the conditional probability distribution of successive tokens. Recently, next-scale prediction methods redefine the process to learn the distribution over multi-scale representations, significantly reducing generation latency. However, these methods condition each scale on all previous scales and require each token to consider all preceding tokens, exhibiting scale and spatial redundancy. To better model the distribution by mitigating redundancy, we propose Markovian Visual AutoRegressive modeling (MVAR), a novel autoregressive framework that introduces scale and spatial Markov assumptions to reduce the complexity of conditional probability modeling. Specifically, we introduce a scale-Markov trajectory that only takes as input the features of adjacent preceding scale for next-scale prediction, enabling the adoption of a parallel training strategy that significantly reduces GPU memory consumption. Furthermore, we propose spatial-Markov attention, which restricts the attention of each token to a localized neighborhood of size k at corresponding positions on adjacent scales, rather than attending to every token across these scales, for the pursuit of reduced modeling complexity. Building on these improvements, we reduce the computational complexity of attention calculation from O(N^2) to O(Nk), enabling training with just eight NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs and eliminating the need for KV cache during inference. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that MVAR achieves comparable or superior performance with both small model trained from scratch and large fine-tuned models, while reducing the average GPU memory footprint by 3.0x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026.

| **[Modeling extremal dependence in multivariate and spatial problems: a practical perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13453v3)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From environmental sciences to finance, there are growing needs for assessing the risk of more extreme events than those observed. Extrapolating extreme events beyond the range of the data is not obvious and requires advanced tools based on extreme value theory. Furthermore, the complexity of risk assessments often requires the inclusion of multiple variables. Extreme value theory provides very important tools for the analysis of multivariate or spatial extreme events, but these are not easily accessible to professionals without appropriate expertise. This article provides a minimal background on multivariate and spatial extremes and gives simple yet thorough instructions on how to analyse high-dimensional extremes using the R package ExtremalDep. After briefly introducing the statistical methodologies, we focus on road testing the package's toolbox through several real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Learning-based Framework for Spatial Impulse Response Compensation in 3D Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20291v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a promising imaging modality that combines the advantages of optical contrast with ultrasound detection. Utilizing ultrasound transducers with larger surface areas can improve detection sensitivity. However, when computationally efficient analytic reconstruction methods that neglect the spatial impulse responses (SIRs) of the transducer are employed, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images will be compromised. Although optimization-based reconstruction methods can explicitly account for SIR effects, their computational cost is generally high, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) applications. To address the need for accurate but rapid 3D PACT image reconstruction, this study presents a framework for establishing a learned SIR compensation method that operates in the data domain. The learned compensation method maps SIR-corrupted PACT measurement data to compensated data that would have been recorded by idealized point-like transducers. Subsequently, the compensated data can be used with a computationally efficient reconstruction method that neglects SIR effects. Two variants of the learned compensation model are investigated that employ a U-Net model and a specifically designed, physics-inspired model, referred to as Deconv-Net. A fast and analytical training data generation procedure is also a component of the presented framework. The framework is rigorously validated in virtual imaging studies, demonstrating resolution improvement and robustness to noise variations, object complexity, and sound speed heterogeneity. When applied to in-vivo breast imaging data, the learned compensation models revealed fine structures that had been obscured by SIR-induced artifacts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of learned SIR compensation in 3D PACT imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE TMI</p></details> |
| **[Connecting reflective asymmetries in multivariate spatial and spatio-temporal covariances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20132v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the analysis of multivariate spatial and univariate spatio-temporal data, it is commonly recognized that asymmetric dependence may exist, which can be addressed using an asymmetric (matrix or space-time, respectively) covariance function within a Gaussian process framework. This paper introduces a new paradigm for constructing asymmetric space-time covariances, which we refer to as "reflective asymmetric," by leveraging recently-introduced models for multivariate spatial data. We first provide new results for reflective asymmetric multivariate spatial models that extends their applicability. We then propose their asymmetric space-time extension, which come from a substantially different perspective than Lagrangian asymmetric space-time covariances. There are fewer parameters in the new models, one controls both the spatial and temporal marginal covariances, and the standard separable model is a special case. In simulation studies and analysis of the frequently-studied Irish wind data, these new models also improve model fit and prediction performance, and they can be easier to estimate. These features indicate broad applicability for improved analysis in environmental and other space-time data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query-Guided Spatial-Temporal-Frequency Interaction for Music Audio-Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19821v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio--Visual Question Answering (AVQA) is a challenging multimodal task that requires jointly reasoning over audio, visual, and textual information in a given video to answer natural language questions. Inspired by recent advances in Video QA, many existing AVQA approaches primarily focus on visual information processing, leveraging pre-trained models to extract object-level and motion-level representations. However, in those methods, the audio input is primarily treated as complementary to video analysis, and the textual question information contributes minimally to audio--visual understanding, as it is typically integrated only in the final stages of reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Query-guided Spatial--Temporal--Frequency (QSTar) interaction method, which effectively incorporates question-guided clues and exploits the distinctive frequency-domain characteristics of audio signals, alongside spatial and temporal perception, to enhance audio--visual understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a Query Context Reasoning (QCR) block inspired by prompting, which guides the model to focus more precisely on semantically relevant audio and visual features. Extensive experiments conducted on several AVQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving significant performance improvements over existing Audio QA, Visual QA, Video QA, and AVQA approaches. The code and pretrained models will be released after publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resolving Primitive-Sharing Ambiguity in Long-Tailed Industrial Point Cloud Segmentation via Spatial Context Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19128v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial point cloud segmentation for Digital Twin construction faces a persistent challenge: safety-critical components such as reducers and valves are systematically misclassified. These failures stem from two compounding factors: such components are rare in training data, yet they share identical local geometry with dominant structures like pipes. This work identifies a dual crisis unique to industrial 3D data extreme class imbalance 215:1 ratio compounded by geometric ambiguity where most tail classes share cylindrical primitives with head classes. Existing frequency-based re-weighting methods address statistical imbalance but cannot resolve geometric ambiguity. We propose spatial context constraints that leverage neighborhood prediction consistency to disambiguate locally similar structures. Our approach extends the Class-Balanced (CB) Loss framework with two architecture-agnostic mechanisms: (1) Boundary-CB, an entropy-based constraint that emphasizes ambiguous boundaries, and (2) Density-CB, a density-based constraint that compensates for scan-dependent variations. Both integrate as plug-and-play modules without network modifications, requiring only loss function replacement. On the Industrial3D dataset (610M points from water treatment facilities), our method achieves 55.74% mIoU with 21.7% relative improvement on tail-class performance (29.59% vs. 24.32% baseline) while preserving head-class accuracy (88.14%). Components with primitive-sharing ambiguity show dramatic gains: reducer improves from 0% to 21.12% IoU; valve improves by 24.3% relative. This resolves geometric ambiguity without the typical head-tail trade-off, enabling reliable identification of safety-critical components for automated knowledge extraction in Digital Twin applications.</p></details> |  |

We introduce m2sv, a scalable benchmark for map-to-street-view spatial reasoning that asks models to infer camera viewing direction by aligning a north-up overhead map with a Street View image captured at the same real-world intersection. We release m2sv-20k, a geographically diverse benchmark with controlled ambiguity, along with m2sv-sft-11k, a curated set of structured reasoning traces for supervised fine-tuning. Despite strong performance on existing multimodal benchmarks, the best evaluated VLM achieves only 65.2% accuracy on m2sv, far below the human baseline of 95%. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning yield consistent gains, cross-benchmark evaluations reveal limited transfer. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we systematically analyze difficulty in map-to-street-view reasoning using both structural signals and human effort, and conduct an extensive failure analysis of adapted open models. Our findings highlight persistent gaps in geometric alignment, evidence aggregation, and reasoning consistency, motivating future work on grounded spatial reasoning across viewpoints.</p></details> |  |

For univariate, stationary, and isotropic fields, the three controlling parameters are the process variance, smoothness, and range. The debiased Whittle likelihood maximization explicitly treats discretization and edge effects for finite sampled regions in parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. As even the best parameter estimate may not be good enough, we provide a test for whether the model specification itself warrants rejection. Our results are practical and relevant for the study of a variety of geophysical fields, and for spatial interpolation, out-of-sample extension, kriging, machine learning, and feature detection of geological data.

| **[Spatial Heterogeneity in Climate Risk and Human Flourishing: An Exploration with Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20880v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), enable scalable extraction of spatial information from unstructured text and offer new methodological opportunities for studying climate geography. This study develops a spatial framework to examine how cumulative climate risk relates to multidimensional human flourishing across U.S. counties. High-resolution climate hazard indicators are integrated with a Human Flourishing Geographic Index (HFGI), an index derived from classification of 2.6 billion geotagged tweets using fine-tuned open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). These indicators are aggregated to the US county-level and mapped to a structural equation model to infer overall climate risk and human flourishing dimensions, including expressed well-being, meaning and purpose, social connectedness, psychological distress, physical condition, economic stability, religiosity, character and virtue, and institutional trust. The results reveal spatially heterogeneous associations between greater cumulative climate risk and lower levels of expressed human flourishing, with coherent spatial patterns corresponding to recurrent exposure to heat, flooding, wind, drought, and wildfire hazards. The study demonstrates how Generative AI can be combined with latent construct modeling for geographical analysis and for spatial knowledge extraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shared Spatial Memory Through Predictive Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04235v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing a consistent shared spatial memory is a critical challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulates coordination as the minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Through an information bottleneck objective, this framework prompts agents to learn not only who and what to communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization, emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode partners' locations-an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells (SPCs). These social representations are further utilized by a hierarchical reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to 64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to collective intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have prepared the open-source code and video demonstration pages: 1.

Time-frequency image features are adaptively weighted along both spatial and channel dimensions by quantifying inter-class similarity and variance based on protocol-specific time-frequency characteristics. Subsequently, a gradient-norm metric is introduced to measure perturbation sensitivity for capturing the inherent instability of OOD samples, which is then fused with energy-based scores for joint inference. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides superior discriminative power and robust performance via SNR and various drone types.</p></details> |  |

We focus on achieving robust spatial generalization of the policy for the peg-in-hole (PiH) task trained from a small number of demonstrations. We propose EquiContact, a hierarchical policy composed of a high-level vision planner (Diffusion Equivariant Descriptor Field, Diff-EDF) and a novel low-level compliant visuomotor policy (Geometric Compliant ACT, G-CompACT). G-CompACT operates using only localized observations (geometrically consistent error vectors (GCEV), force-torque readings, and wrist-mounted RGB images) and produces actions defined in the end-effector frame. Through these design choices, we show that the entire EquiContact pipeline is SE(3)-equivariant, from perception to force control. We also outline three key components for spatially generalizable contact-rich policies: compliance, localized policies, and induced equivariance. Real-world experiments on PiH, screwing, and surface wiping tasks demonstrate a near-perfect success rate and robust generalization to unseen spatial configurations, validating the proposed framework and principles.</p></details> | Submitted to RSS |
| **[Spatial-Conditioned Reasoning in Long-Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18100v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon egocentric video presents significant challenges for visual navigation due to viewpoint drift and the absence of persistent geometric context. Although recent vision-language models perform well on image and short-video reasoning, their spatial reasoning capability in long egocentric sequences remains limited. In this work, we study how explicit spatial signals influence VLM-based video understanding without modifying model architectures or inference procedures. We introduce Sanpo-D, a fine-grained re-annotation of the Google Sanpo dataset, and benchmark multiple VLMs on navigation-oriented spatial queries. To examine input-level inductive bias, we further fuse depth maps with RGB frames and evaluate their impact on spatial reasoning. Our results reveal a trade-off between general-purpose accuracy and spatial specialization, showing that depth-aware and spatially grounded representations can improve performance on safety-critical tasks such as pedestrian and obstruction detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Federated Class-Incremental Learning via Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01327v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) enables Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) from distributed data. Existing FCIL methods typically integrate old knowledge preservation into local client training. However, these methods cannot avoid spatial-temporal client drift caused by data heterogeneity and often incur significant computational and communication overhead, limiting practical deployment. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a novel approach, Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation (STSA), which provides a unified framework to aggregate feature statistics both spatially (across clients) and temporally (across stages). The aggregated feature statistics are unaffected by data heterogeneity and can be used to update the classifier in closed form at each stage. Additionally, we introduce STSA-E, a communication-efficient variant with theoretical guarantees, achieving similar performance to STSA-E with much lower communication overhead. Extensive experiments on three widely used FCIL datasets, with varying degrees of data heterogeneity, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FCIL methods in terms of performance, flexibility, and both communication and computation efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/Yuqin-G/STSA.</p></details> | WWW 2026 |
| **[Cross-Domain Transfer with Self-Supervised Spectral-Spatial Modeling for Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18088v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning has demonstrated considerable potential in hyperspectral representation, yet its application in cross-domain transfer scenarios remains under-explored. Existing methods, however, still rely on source domain annotations and are susceptible to distribution shifts, leading to degraded generalization performance in the target domain. To address this, this paper proposes a self-supervised cross-domain transfer framework that learns transferable spectral-spatial joint representations without source labels and achieves efficient adaptation under few samples in the target domain. During the self-supervised pre-training phase, a Spatial-Spectral Transformer (S2Former) module is designed. It adopts a dual-branch spatial-spectral transformer and introduces a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to achieve spectral-spatial collaborative modeling: the spatial branch enhances structural awareness through random masking, while the spectral branch captures fine-grained differences. Both branches mutually guide each other to improve semantic consistency. We further propose a Frequency Domain Constraint (FDC) to maintain frequency-domain consistency through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT) and high-frequency magnitude loss, thereby enhancing the model's capability to discern fine details and boundaries. During the fine-tuning phase, we introduce a Diffusion-Aligned Fine-tuning (DAFT) distillation mechanism. This aligns semantic evolution trajectories through a teacher-student structure, enabling robust transfer learning under low-label conditions. Experimental results demonstrate stable classification performance and strong cross-domain adaptability across four hyperspectral datasets, validating the method's effectiveness under resource-constrained conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpatialEmb: Extract and Encode Spatial Information for 1-Stage Multi-channel Multi-speaker ASR on Arbitrary Microphone Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18037v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial information is a critical clue for multi-channel multi-speaker target speech recognition. Most state-of-the-art multi-channel Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems extract spatial features only during the speech separation stage, followed by standard single-channel ASR on the separated speech. This approach results in an inefficient, lengthy pipeline and sub-optimal ASR performance due to the accumulated errors from preprocessing modules. Furthermore, most spatial feature extraction methods depend on the knowledge of speaker positions and microphone topology, making the systems reliant on specific settings and challenging to adapt to new equipment. In this work, we propose a solution to these issues with a lightweight embedding module named SpatialEmb, which extracts and encodes spatial information directly for the ASR model, supporting both fixed and arbitrary microphone topology. We conduct comprehensive experiments on AliMeeting, a real meeting corpus, to determine the optimal model design for SpatialEmb in terms of both performance and efficiency. Our best model trained with 105 hours Train-Ali-far achieves 17.04% and 20.32% character error rates (CER) on the Eval and Test sets, establishing a new state-of-the-art result with the same training data.</p></details> | SLT 2024 |
| **[LLMs as Layout Designers: Enhanced Spatial Reasoning for Content-Aware Layout Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16891v4)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning and planning abilities in textual domains and can effectively follow instructions for complex tasks, their ability to understand and manipulate spatial relationships remains limited. Such capabilities are crucial for content-aware graphic layout design, where the goal is to arrange heterogeneous elements onto a canvas so that final design remains visually balanced and structurally feasible. This problem requires precise coordination of placement, alignment, and structural organization of multiple elements within a constrained visual space. To address this limitation, we introduce LaySPA, a reinforcement learning-based framework that augments LLM-based agents with explicit spatial reasoning capabilities for layout design. LaySPA employs hybrid reward signals that jointly capture geometric constraints, structural fidelity, and visual quality, enabling agents to navigate the canvas, model inter-element relationships, and optimize spatial arrangements. Through group-relative policy optimization, the agent generates content-aware layouts that reflect salient regions, respect spatial constraints, and produces an interpretable reasoning trace explaining placement decisions and a structured layout specification. Experimental results show that LaySPA substantially improves the generation of structurally valid and visually appealing layouts, outperforming larger general-purpose LLMs and achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art specialized layout models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A uniformity principle for spatial matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13426v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Platforms matching spatially distributed supply to demand face a fundamental design choice: given a fixed total budget of service range, how should it be allocated across supply nodes ex ante, i.e. before supply and demand locations are realized, to maximize fulfilled demand? We model this problem using bipartite random geometric graphs where $n$ supply and $m$ demand nodes are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]^k$ ($k \ge 1$), and edges form when demand falls within a supply node's service region, the volume of which is determined by its service range. Since each supply node serves at most one demand, platform performance is determined by the expected size of a maximum matching. We establish a uniformity principle: whenever one service range allocation is more uniform than the other, the more uniform allocation yields a larger expected matching. This principle emerges from diminishing marginal returns to range expanding service range, and limited interference between supply nodes due to bounded ranges naturally fragmenting the graph. For $k=1$, we further characterize the expected matching size through a Markov chain embedding and derive closed-form expressions for special cases. Our results provide theoretical guidance for optimizing service range allocation and designing incentive structures in ride-hailing, on-demand labor markets, and drone delivery networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Highly Multivariate Large-scale Spatial Stochastic Processes -- A Cross-Markov Random Field Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10396v3)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Key challenges in the analysis of highly multivariate large-scale spatial stochastic processes, where both the number of components (p) and spatial locations (n) can be large, include achieving maximal sparsity in the joint precision matrix, ensuring efficient computational cost for its generation, accommodating asymmetric cross-covariance in the joint covariance matrix, and delivering scientific interpretability. We propose a cross-MRF model class, consisting of a mixed spatial graphical model framework and cross-MRF theory, to collectively address these challenges in one unified framework across two modelling stages. The first stage exploits scientifically informed conditional independence (CI) among p component fields and allows for a step-wise parallel generation of joint covariance and precision matrix, enabling a simultaneous accommodation of asymmetric cross-covariance in joint covariance matrix and sparsity in joint precision matrix. The second stage extends the first-stage CI to doubly CI among both p and n and unearths the cross-MRF via an extended Hammersley-Clifford theorem for multivariate spatial stochastic processes. This results in the sparsest possible representation of the joint precision matrix and ensures its lowest generation complexity. We demonstrate with 1D simulated comparative studies and 2D real-world data.</p></details> | 54 pages; 10 figures |
| **[Masked Depth Modeling for Spatial Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17895v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial visual perception is a fundamental requirement in physical-world applications like autonomous driving and robotic manipulation, driven by the need to interact with 3D environments. Capturing pixel-aligned metric depth using RGB-D cameras would be the most viable way, yet it usually faces obstacles posed by hardware limitations and challenging imaging conditions, especially in the presence of specular or texture-less surfaces. In this work, we argue that the inaccuracies from depth sensors can be viewed as "masked" signals that inherently reflect underlying geometric ambiguities. Building on this motivation, we present LingBot-Depth, a depth completion model which leverages visual context to refine depth maps through masked depth modeling and incorporates an automated data curation pipeline for scalable training. It is encouraging to see that our model outperforms top-tier RGB-D cameras in terms of both depth precision and pixel coverage. Experimental results on a range of downstream tasks further suggest that LingBot-Depth offers an aligned latent representation across RGB and depth modalities. We release the code, checkpoint, and 3M RGB-depth pairs (including 2M real data and 1M simulated data) to the community of spatial perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report, 19 pages, 15 figures and 4 tables</p></details> |

Simulating these materials, for instance using finite element methods, is often computationally demanding and slow. Worse, such methods can suffer from numerical artifacts called ``membrane locking'' that makes cloth appear artificially stiff. Here we propose a general framework, called SpringTime, for learning a simple yet efficient surrogate model that captures the effects of these complex materials using only motion observations. The cloth is discretized into a mass-spring network with unknown material parameters that are learned directly from the motion data, using a novel force-and-impulse loss function. Our approach demonstrates the ability to accurately model spatially varying material properties from a variety of data sources, and immunity to membrane locking which plagues FEM-based simulations. Compared to graph-based networks and neural ODE-based architectures, our method achieves significantly faster training times, higher reconstruction accuracy, and improved generalization to novel dynamic scenarios.

NOMADS formulates model identification as a convex optimization problem, in which the state-space coefficient matrices and a memory kernel are estimated jointly under physically motivated constraints using projected gradient descent. The proposed framework models memory effects through a spatially homogeneous kernel, enabling scalable identification of non-Markovian dynamics while keeping the number of free parameters moderate. This structure allows NOMADS to integrate information from multiple multi-dimensional time-series data even when no single experiment provides full excitation. In the Markovian setting, physical constraints can be incorporated to enforce conservation laws. Numerical experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that NOMADS achieves substantially improved generalization accuracy compared to existing DMD-based methods even for noisy train data, and reproduces energy conservation in the Markovian case.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uni-RS: A Spatially Faithful Unified Understanding and Generation Model for Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17673v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified remote sensing multimodal models exhibit a pronounced spatial reversal curse: Although they can accurately recognize and describe object locations in images, they often fail to faithfully execute the same spatial relations during text-to-image generation, where such relations constitute core semantic information in remote sensing. Motivated by this observation, we propose Uni-RS, the first unified multimodal model tailored for remote sensing, to explicitly address the spatial asymmetry between understanding and generation. Specifically, we first introduce explicit Spatial-Layout Planning to transform textual instructions into spatial layout plans, decoupling geometric planning from visual synthesis. We then impose Spatial-Aware Query Supervision to bias learnable queries toward spatial relations explicitly specified in the instruction. Finally, we develop Image-Caption Spatial Layout Variation to expose the model to systematic geometry-consistent spatial transformations. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our approach substantially improves spatial faithfulness in text-to-image generation, while maintaining strong performance on multimodal understanding tasks like image captioning, visual grounding, and VQA tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPACE-CLIP: Spatial Perception via Adaptive CLIP Embeddings for Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17657v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has accomplished extraordinary success for semantic understanding but inherently struggles to perceive geometric structure. Existing methods attempt to bridge this gap by querying CLIP with textual prompts, a process that is often indirect and inefficient. This paper introduces a fundamentally different approach using a dual-pathway decoder. We present SPACE-CLIP, an architecture that unlocks and interprets latent geometric knowledge directly from a frozen CLIP vision encoder, completely bypassing the text encoder and its associated textual prompts. A semantic pathway interprets high-level features, dynamically conditioned on global context using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). In addition, a structural pathway extracts fine-grained spatial details from early layers. These complementary streams are hierarchically fused, enabling a robust synthesis of semantic context and precise geometry. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that SPACE-CLIP dramatically outperforms previous CLIP-based methods. Our ablation studies validate that the synergistic fusion of our dual pathways is critical to this success. SPACE-CLIP offers a new, efficient, and architecturally elegant blueprint for repurposing large-scale vision models. The proposed method is not just a standalone depth estimator, but a readily integrable spatial perception module for the next generation of embodied AI systems, such as vision-language-action (VLA) models. Our model is available at https://github.com/taewan2002/space-clip</p></details> |  |
| **[SpatialMath: Spatial Comprehension-Infused Symbolic Reasoning for Mathematical Problem-Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17489v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Small-to-Medium sized Language Models (MSLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in integrating visual and textual information but still face significant limitations in visual comprehension and mathematical reasoning, particularly in geometric problems with diverse levels of visual infusion. Current models struggle to accurately decompose intricate visual inputs and connect perception with structured reasoning, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose SpatialMath, a novel Spatial Comprehension-Infused Symbolic Reasoning Framework designed to integrate spatial representations into structured symbolic reasoning chains. SpatialMath employs a specialized perception module to extract spatially-grounded representations from visual diagrams, capturing critical geometric structures and spatial relationships. These representations are then methodically infused into symbolic reasoning chains, facilitating visual comprehension-aware structured reasoning. To this end, we introduce MATHVERSE-PLUS, a novel dataset containing structured visual interpretations and step-by-step reasoning paths for vision-intensive mathematical problems. SpatialMath significantly outperforms strong multimodal baselines, achieving up to 10 percentage points improvement over supervised fine-tuning with data augmentation in vision-intensive settings. Robustness analysis reveals that enhanced spatial representations directly improve reasoning accuracy, reinforcing the need for structured perception-to-reasoning pipelines in MSLMs.</p></details> |  |

We propose AGE-Net, a ConvNeXt-based framework that integrates Spectral--Spatial Fusion (SSF), Anatomical Graph Reasoning (AGR), and Differential Refinement (DFR). To capture predictive uncertainty and preserve label ordinality, AGE-Net employs a Normal-Inverse-Gamma (NIG) evidential regression head and a pairwise ordinal ranking constraint. On a knee KL dataset, AGE-Net achieves a quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) of 0.9017 +/- 0.0045 and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.2349 +/- 0.0028 over three random seeds, outperforming strong CNN baselines and showing consistent gains in ablation studies. We further outline evaluations of uncertainty quality, robustness, and explainability, with additional experimental figures to be included in the full manuscript.</p></details> | 22 pages |

While these calls provide valuable visual context in real time, the experience of interacting with people and moving around a space is significantly reduced when compared to co-located conversations. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of Mobile Augmented Reality applications to enable more spatial forms of collaboration across distance. To better understand the dynamics of mobile AR collaboration and how this medium compares against the status quo, we conducted a comparative structured observation study to analyze people's perception of space and interaction with remote collaborators across mobile video calls and AR-based calls. Fourteen pairs of participants completed a spatial collaboration task using each medium. Through a mixed-methods analysis of session videos, transcripts, motion logs, post-task exercises, and interviews, we highlight how the choice of medium influences the roles and responsibilities that collaborators take on and the construction of a shared language for coordination. We discuss the importance of spatial reasoning with one's body, how video calls help participants "be on the same page" more directly, and how AR calls enable both onsite and remote collaborators to engage with the space and each other in ways that resemble in-person interaction. Our study offers a nuanced view of the benefits and limitations of both mediums, and we conclude with a discussion of design implications for future systems that integrate mobile video and AR to better support spatial collaboration in its many forms.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, Volume 10, Issue 2, Article CSCW037. 31 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |

The Conditional Diffusion Model-based Inverse Problem Solver (CDI) has previously demonstrated effective probabilistic inference for one-dimensional temporal signals, but its applicability to higher-dimensional spatial data remains unexplored. We extend CDI to two-dimensional spatial conditioning, enabling probabilistic parameter inference directly from spatial observations. We validate this extension on convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) parameter inference - a challenging multi-parameter inverse problem in materials characterization where sample geometry, electronic structure, and thermal properties must be extracted from 2D diffraction patterns. Using simulated CBED data with ground-truth parameters, we demonstrate that CDI produces well-calibrated posterior distributions that accurately reflect measurement constraints: tight distributions for well-determined quantities and appropriately broad distributions for ambiguous parameters. In contrast, standard regression methods - while appearing accurate on aggregate metrics - mask this underlying uncertainty by predicting training set means for poorly constrained parameters. Our results confirm that CDI successfully extends from temporal to spatial domains, providing the genuine uncertainty information required for robust scientific inference.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LLM-based agents often fail at genuine geospatial computation, relying instead on web search or pattern matching while hallucinating spatial relationships. We present Spatial-Agent, an AI agent grounded in foundational theories of spatial information science. Our approach formalizes geo-analytical question answering as a concept transformation problem, where natural-language questions are parsed into executable workflows represented as GeoFlow Graphs -- directed acyclic graphs with nodes corresponding to spatial concepts and edges representing transformations. Drawing on spatial information theory, Spatial-Agent extracts spatial concepts, assigns functional roles with principled ordering constraints, and composes transformation sequences through template-based generation. Extensive experiments on MapEval-API and MapQA benchmarks demonstrate that Spatial-Agent significantly outperforms existing baselines including ReAct and Reflexion, while producing interpretable and executable geospatial workflows.</p></details> | 15pages, 4 figures |

To bridge this gap, we propose the Global Adaptive Fourier Network (GAF-Net), a lightweight deep complex network that aims to establish a balance between performance and computational efficiency. The GAF-Net architecture consists of three components. First, a dual-feature encoder combining short-time Fourier transform and gammatone features enhances the robustness of acoustic representation. Second, a channel-independent globally adaptive Fourier modulator efficiently captures long-term temporal dependencies while preserving the spatial cues. Finally, a dynamic gating mechanism is implemented to reduce processing artifacts. Experimental results show that GAF-Net achieves competitive performance, particularly in terms of binaural cues (ILD and IPD error) and objective intelligibility (MBSTOI), with fewer parameters and computational cost. These results confirm that GAF-Net provides a feasible way to achieve high-fidelity binaural processing on resource-constrained devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

Current research on their fusion strategies primarily bifurcates into sequential and parallel paradigms, yet the selection process remains largely empirical, lacking systematic analysis and unified principles. We systematically compare channel-spatial attention combinations under a unified framework, building an evaluation suite of 18 topologies across four classes: sequential, parallel, multi-scale, and residual. Across two vision and nine medical datasets, we uncover a "data scale-method-performance" coupling law: (1) in few-shot tasks, the "Channel-Multi-scale Spatial" cascaded structure achieves optimal performance; (2) in medium-scale tasks, parallel learnable fusion architectures demonstrate superior results; (3) in large-scale tasks, parallel structures with dynamic gating yield the best performance. Additionally, experiments indicate that the "Spatial-Channel" order is more stable and effective for fine-grained classification, while residual connections mitigate vanishing gradient problems across varying data scales. We thus propose scenario-based guidelines for building future attention modules. Code is open-sourced at https://github.com/DWlzm.</p></details> |  |
| **[TangramPuzzle: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models with Compositional Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16520v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in visual recognition and semantic understanding. Nevertheless, their ability to perform precise compositional spatial reasoning remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often involve relatively simple tasks and rely on semantic approximations or coarse relative positioning, while their evaluation metrics are typically limited and lack rigorous mathematical formulations. To bridge this gap, we introduce TangramPuzzle, a geometry-grounded benchmark designed to evaluate compositional spatial reasoning through the lens of the classic Tangram game. We propose the Tangram Construction Expression (TCE), a symbolic geometric framework that grounds tangram assemblies in exact, machine-verifiable coordinate specifications, to mitigate the ambiguity of visual approximation. We design two complementary tasks: Outline Prediction, which demands inferring global shapes from local components, and End-to-End Code Generation, which requires solving inverse geometric assembly problems. We conduct extensive evaluation experiments on advanced open-source and proprietary models, revealing an interesting insight: MLLMs tend to prioritize matching the target silhouette while neglecting geometric constraints, leading to distortions or deformations of the pieces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Auditory Attention Decoding without Spatial Information: A Diotic EEG Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16442v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auditory attention decoding (AAD) identifies the attended speech stream in multi-speaker environments by decoding brain signals such as electroencephalography (EEG). This technology is essential for realizing smart hearing aids that address the cocktail party problem and for facilitating objective audiometry systems. Existing AAD research mainly utilizes dichotic environments where different speech signals are presented to the left and right ears, enabling models to classify directional attention rather than speech content. However, this spatial reliance limits applicability to real-world scenarios, such as the "cocktail party" situation, where speakers overlap or move dynamically. To address this challenge, we propose an AAD framework for diotic environments where identical speech mixtures are presented to both ears, eliminating spatial cues. Our approach maps EEG and speech signals into a shared latent space using independent encoders. We extract speech features using wav2vec 2.0 and encode them with a 2-layer 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), while employing the BrainNetwork architecture for EEG encoding. The model identifies the attended speech by calculating the cosine similarity between EEG and speech representations. We evaluate our method on a diotic EEG dataset and achieve 72.70% accuracy, which is 22.58% higher than the state-of-the-art direction-based AAD method.</p></details> |  |

This approach leverages the largest-ever optically printed 3D specimen dataset, comprising a large family of parametrically designed complex minimal surface structures that have undergone terminal chemical characterisation. Conventional vision models are ill-equipped for this task, as they lack an inductive bias for the coupled, non-linear interactions of optical physics (diffraction, absorption) and material physics (diffusion, convection) that govern the final chemical state. To address this, we propose Coupled Physics-Gated Adaptation (C-PGA), a novel multimodal fusion architecture. Unlike standard concatenation, C-PGA explicitly models physical coupling by using sparse geometrical and process parameters (e.g., surface transport, print layer height) as a Query to dynamically gate and adapt the dense visual features via feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). This mechanism spatially modulates dual 3D visual streams-extracted by parallel 3D-CNNs processing raw projection stacks and their diffusion-diffraction corrected counterparts allowing the model to recalibrate its visual perception based on the physical context. This approach offers a breakthrough in virtual chemical characterisation, eliminating the need for traditional post-print measurements and enabling precise control over the chemical conversion state.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spherical Spatial Autoregressive Model for Spherically Embedded Spatial Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16385v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spherically embedded spatial data are spatially indexed observations whose values naturally reside on or can be equivalently mapped to the unit sphere. Such data are increasingly ubiquitous in fields ranging from geochemistry to demography. However, analysing such data presents unique difficulties due to the intrinsic non-Euclidean nature of the sphere, and rigorous methodologies for statistical modelling, inference, and uncertainty quantification remain limited. This paper introduces a unified framework to address these three limitations for spherically embedded spatial data. We first propose a novel spherical spatial autoregressive model that leverages optimal transport geometry and then extend it to accommodate exogenous covariates. Second, for either scenario with or without covariates, we establish the asymptotic properties of the estimators and derive a distribution-free Wald test for spatial dependence, complemented by a bootstrap procedure to enhance finite-sample performance. Third, we contribute a novel approach to uncertainty quantification by developing a conformal prediction procedure specifically tailored to spherically embedded spatial data. The practical utility of these methodological advances is illustrated through extensive simulations and applications to Spanish geochemical compositions and Japanese age-at-death mortality distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Spatial Goodness Encoding: Advancing and Scaling Forward-Forward Learning Without Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12394v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm offers a promising alternative to backpropagation (BP). Despite advancements in recent FF-based extensions, which have enhanced the original algorithm and adapted it to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), they often suffer from limited representational capacity and poor scalability to large-scale datasets, primarily due to exploding channel dimensionality. In this work, we propose adaptive spatial goodness encoding (ASGE), a new FF-based training framework tailored for CNNs. ASGE leverages feature maps to compute spatially-aware goodness representations at each layer, enabling layer-wise supervision. Crucially, this approach decouples classification complexity from channel dimensionality, thereby addressing the issue of channel explosion and achieving competitive performance compared to other BP alternatives. ASGE outperforms all other FF-based approaches across multiple benchmarks, delivering test accuracies of 99.65% on MNIST, 93.41% on FashionMNIST, 90.62% on CIFAR-10, and 65.42% on CIFAR-100. Moreover, we present the first successful application of FF-based training to ImageNet, with Top-1 and Top-5 accuracies of 51.58% and 75.23%. Furthermore, we propose three prediction strategies to achieve flexible trade-offs among accuracy, parameters and memory usage, enabling deployment under diverse resource constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2026 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP2026)</p></details> |
| **[The Spatial Blindspot of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09954v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, but their ability to capture spatial relationships remains a blindspot. Current VLMs are typically built with contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) style image encoders. The training recipe often flattens images into 1D patch sequences, discarding the 2D structure necessary for spatial reasoning. We argue that this lack of spatial awareness is a missing dimension in VLM design and a bottleneck for applications requiring spatial grounding, such as robotics and embodied AI. To address this, we investigate (i) image encoders trained with alternative objectives and (ii) 2D positional encodings. Our experiments show that these architectural choices can lead to improved spatial reasoning on several benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work done as part of the EleutherAI SOAR Program</p></details> |

This paper therefore presents CSSMamba (Clustering-guided Spatial-Spectral Mamba) framework to better address the challenges, with the following contributions. First, to achieve efficient and adaptive token sequences for improved Mamba performance, we integrate the clustering mechanism into a spatial Mamba architecture, leading to a cluster-guided spatial Mamba module (CSpaMamba) that reduces the Mamba sequence length and improves Mamba feature learning capability. Second, to improve the learning of both spatial and spectral information, we integrate the CSpaMamba module with a spectral mamba module (SpeMamba), leading to a complete clustering-guided spatial-spectral Mamba framework. Third, to further improve feature learning capability, we introduce an Attention-Driven Token Selection mechanism to optimize Mamba token sequencing. Last, to seamlessly integrate clustering into the Mamba model in a coherent manner, we design a Learnable Clustering Module that learns the cluster memberships in an adaptive manner. Experiments on the Pavia University, Indian Pines, and Liao-Ning 01 datasets demonstrate that CSSMamba achieves higher accuracy and better boundary preservation compared to state-of-the-art CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based methods.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |
| **[DISPATCH -- Decentralized Informed Spatial Planning and Assignment of Tasks for Cooperative Heterogeneous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17915v4)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial task allocation in systems such as multi-robot delivery or ride-sharing requires balancing efficiency with fair service across tasks. Greedy assignment policies that match each agent to its highest-preference or lowest-cost task can maximize efficiency but often create inequities: some tasks receive disproportionately favorable service (e.g., shorter delays or better matches), while others face long waits or poor allocations. We study fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where tasks vary in preference alignment and urgency. Most existing approaches either assume centralized coordination or largely ignore fairness under partial observability. Distinct from this prior work, we establish a connection between the Eisenberg-Gale (EG) equilibrium convex program and decentralized, partially observable multi-agent learning. Building on this connection, we develop two equilibrium-informed algorithms that integrate fairness and efficiency: (i) a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework, EG-MARL, whose training is guided by a centralized EG equilibrium assignment algorithm; and (ii) a stochastic online optimization mechanism that performs guided exploration and subset-based fair assignment as tasks are discovered. We evaluate on Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE) simulations across varying team sizes against centralized EG, Hungarian, and Min-Max distance baselines, and also present a Webots-based warehouse proof-of-concept with heterogeneous robots. Both methods preserve the fairness-efficiency balance of the EG solution under partial observability, with EG-MARL achieving near-centralized coordination and reduced travel distances, and the online mechanism enabling real-time allocation with competitive fairness.</p></details> |  |
| **[regTPS-KLE: A Novel Approach To Approximate A Gaussian Random Field for Bayesian Spatial Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04256v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian random field is a ubiquitous model for spatial phenomena in diverse scientific disciplines. Its approximation is often crucial for computational feasibility in simulation, inference, and uncertainty quantification. The Karhunen-Loève Expansion provides a theoretically optimal basis for representing a Gaussian random field as a sum of deterministic orthonormal functions weighted by uncorrelated random variables. While this is a well-established method for dimension reduction and approximation of (spatial) stochastic processes, its practical application depends on the explicit or implicit definition of the covariance structure. In this work, we propose a novel approach, referred to as regTPS-KLE, for approximating a Gaussian random field by explicitly constructing its covariance via a regularized thin plate spline (TPS) kernel. Because TPS kernels are conditionally positive definite and lack a direct spectral decomposition, we formulate the covariance as the inverse of a regularized elliptic operator. To evaluate its statistical performance, we compare its predictive accuracy and computational efficiency with a Gaussian random field approximation constructed using the stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) method and implemented within an MCMC algorithm. In simulation studies, the predictive differences between the SPDE and regTPS-KLE models were minimal when the spatial field was generated using Matèrn and exponential covariance functions, while regTPS-KLE models consistently outperformed the SPDE approach in terms of computational efficiency. In a real data application, regTPS-KLE exhibits superior predictive accuracy compared with SPDE models based on leave-one-out cross-validation while also achieving improved computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Situational and Spatial Awareness of VLMs with Synthetically Generated Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15780v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs) remains fragile when semantics hinge on subtle temporal or geometric cues. We introduce a synthetic benchmark that probes two complementary skills: situational awareness (recognizing whether an interaction is harmful or benign) and spatial awareness (tracking who does what to whom, and reasoning about relative positions and motion). Through minimal video pairs, we test three challenges: distinguishing violence from benign activity, binding assailant roles across viewpoints, and judging fine-grained trajectory alignment. While we evaluate recent VLMs in a training-free setting, the benchmark is applicable to any video classification model. Results show performance only slightly above chance across tasks. A simple aid, stable color cues, partly reduces assailant role confusions but does not resolve the underlying weakness. By releasing data and code, we aim to provide reproducible diagnostics and seed exploration of lightweight spatial priors to complement large-scale pretraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[AtomWorld: A Benchmark for Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models on Crystalline Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04704v3)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual reasoning and are beginning to develop spatial understanding, prompting the question of whether these abilities can be combined for complex, domain-specific tasks. This question is essential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D atomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully applied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate understandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core reasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific workflows.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SAGE-FM, a lightweight spatial transcriptomics foundation model based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) trained with a masked central spot prediction objective. Trained on 416 human Visium samples spanning 15 organs, SAGE-FM learns spatially coherent embeddings that robustly recover masked genes, with 91% of masked genes showing significant correlations (p < 0.05). The embeddings generated by SAGE-FM outperform MOFA and existing spatial transcriptomics methods in unsupervised clustering and preservation of biological heterogeneity. SAGE-FM generalizes to downstream tasks, enabling 81% accuracy in pathologist-defined spot annotation in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and improving glioblastoma subtype prediction relative to MOFA. In silico perturbation experiments further demonstrate that the model captures directional ligand-receptor and upstream-downstream regulatory effects consistent with ground truth. These results demonstrate that simple, parameter-efficient GCNs can serve as biologically interpretable and spatially aware foundation models for large-scale spatial transcriptomics.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |

This paper revisits the $α$--regression framework, which uses a flexible power transformation parameterized by $α$ to interpolate between raw data analysis and log-ratio methods, naturally handling zeros without imputation while allowing data-driven transformation selection. We formulate $α$--regression as a non-linear least squares problem, provide efficient estimation via the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, and derive marginal effects for interpretation. The framework is extended to spatial settings through two models: the $α$--spatially lagged X regression model, which incorporates spatial spillover effects via spatially lagged covariates with decomposition into direct and indirect effects, the $α$--spatially autoregressive regression model and the geographically weighted $α$--regression, which allows coefficients to vary spatially for capturing local relationships. Applications to two real data sets illustrate the performance of the models and showcase that spatial extensions capture the spatial dependence and improve the predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Global-local shrinkage priors for modeling random effects in multivariate spatial small area estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14752v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small area estimation (SAE) plays a central role in survey statistics and epidemiology, providing reliable estimates for domains with limited sample sizes. The multivariate Fay-Herriot model has been extensively used for this purpose, because it enhances estimation accuracy by borrowing strength across multiple correlated variables. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian extension of the multivariate Fay-Herriot model that enables flexible, component-specific shrinkage of the random effects. The proposed approach employs global-local priors formulated through a sandwich mixture representation, allowing adaptive regularization of each element of the random-effect vectors. This construction yields greater robustness and prevents excessive shrinkage in areas exhibiting strong underlying signals. In addition, we incorporate spatial dependence into the model to account for geographical correlation across small areas. The resulting spatial multivariate framework simultaneously exploits cross-variable relationships and spatial structure, yielding improved estimation efficiency. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and an empirical application to real survey data.</p></details> | 39 pages, 10 figures |

Vision-Language models Still Struggle With Spatial Understanding Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20174v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding, which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on https://github.com/kong13661/LRR-Bench.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress, existing MM methods still face two key limitations: (i) low sample efficiency, due to ineffective use of redundant data generated during long-term MM interactions; and (ii) poor spatial generalization, as policies trained on specific tasks struggle to transfer to new spatial layouts without additional training. In this paper, we address these challenges through Adaptive Experience Selection (AES) and model-based dynamic imagination. In particular, AES makes MM agents pay more attention to critical experience fragments in long trajectories that affect task success, improving skill chain learning and mitigating skill forgetting. Based on AES, a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM) is introduced for Model-Predictive Forward Planning (MPFP) by capturing the coupled dynamics between the mobile base and the manipulator and imagining the dynamics of future manipulations. RSSM-based MPFP can reinforce MM skill learning on the current task while enabling effective generalization to new spatial layouts. Comparative studies across different experimental configurations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing MM policies. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of our method.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of high-quality spatial natural language query corpora limits the performance of such systems. Existing methods rely on manual knowledge base construction and template-based dynamic generation, which suffer from low construction efficiency and unstable corpus quality. This paper presents semantic-aware spatial corpus construction (SSCC), a tool designed for constructing high-quality spatial natural language query and executable language query pair corpora. SSCC consists of two core modules: (i) a knowledge base construction module based on spatial relations, which extracts and determines spatial relations from datasets, and (ii) a template-augmented query pair corpus generation module, which produces query pairs via template matching and parameter substitution. The tool ensures geometric consistency and adherence to spatial logic in the generated spatial relations. Experimental results demonstrate that SSCC achieves (i) a 53x efficiency improvement for knowledge base construction and (ii) a 2.5x effectiveness improvement for query pair corpus. SSCC provides high-quality corpus support for spatial natural language interface training, substantially reducing both time and labor costs in corpus construction.</p></details> |  |

A Comparative Study of AR X-Ray vs. 2D Minimap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14316v3)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and indoor sensing increasingly support decision-making in spatial environments. However, traditional visualization methods impose a substantial mental workload when viewers translate this digital information into real-world spaces, leading to inappropriate reliance on AI. Embedded visualizations in Augmented Reality (AR), by integrating information into physical environments, may reduce this workload and foster more appropriate reliance on AI. To assess this, we conducted an empirical study (N = 32) comparing an AR embedded visualization (X-ray) and 2D Minimap in AI-assisted, time-critical spatial target selection tasks. Surprisingly, evidence shows that the embedded visualization led to greater inappropriate reliance on AI, primarily as over-reliance, due to factors like perceptual challenges, visual proximity illusions, and highly realistic visual representations. Nonetheless, the embedded visualization demonstrated benefits in spatial mapping. We conclude by discussing empirical insights, design implications, and directions for future research on human-AI collaborative decision in AR.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures, Accepted for publication in CHI'26, Barcelona, Spain, April 13 - 17, 2026; CHI '26: ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</p></details> |

However, existing methods generally treat the frequency domain as a whole, neglecting the differences in the information carried by its internal components. According to Fourier transform theory, phase and amplitude represent different types of information in the image. Our spectrum swapping experiments show that magnitude mainly reflects pixel-level intensity, while phase predominantly governs image structure. To prevent interference between phase and magnitude feature learning caused by unified frequency-domain modeling, we propose the Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model (PAS-Mamba) for MRI Reconstruction, a framework that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in the frequency domain and combines it with image-domain features for better reconstruction. In the image domain, LocalMamba preserves spatial locality to sharpen fine anatomical details. In frequency domain, we disentangle amplitude and phase into two specialized branches to avoid representational coupling. To respect the concentric geometry of frequency information, we propose Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) to serialize features from low to high frequencies. Finally, a Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) adaptively fuses amplitude phase representations and enables bidirectional exchange between frequency and image domains, delivering superior reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the IXI and fastMRI knee datasets show that PAS-Mamba consistently outperforms state of the art reconstruction methods.</p></details> |  |

However, they still struggle to properly render the spatial relationships described in text prompts. To address the lack of spatial information in T2I generations, existing methods typically use external network conditioning and predefined layouts, resulting in higher computational costs and reduced flexibility. Our approach builds upon a curated dataset of spatially explicit prompts, meticulously extracted and synthesized from LAION-400M to ensure precise alignment between textual descriptions and spatial layouts. Alongside this dataset, we present ESPLoRA, a flexible fine-tuning framework based on Low-Rank Adaptation, specifically designed to enhance spatial consistency in generative models without increasing generation time or compromising the quality of the outputs. In addition to ESPLoRA, we propose refined evaluation metrics grounded in geometric constraints, capturing 3D spatial relations such as "in front of" or "behind". These metrics also expose spatial biases in T2I models which, even when not fully mitigated, can be strategically exploited by our TORE algorithm to further improve the spatial consistency of generated images. Our method outperforms CoMPaSS, the current baseline framework, on spatial consistency benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks primarily emphasize indoor or street settings, overlooking the unique challenges of open-ended urban spaces characterized by rich semantics, complex geometries, and view variations. To address this, we introduce CityCube, a systematic benchmark designed to probe cross-view reasoning capabilities of current VLMs in urban settings. CityCube integrates four viewpoint dynamics to mimic camera movements and spans a wide spectrum of perspectives from multiple platforms, e.g., vehicles, drones and satellites. For a comprehensive assessment, it features 5,022 meticulously annotated multi-view QA pairs categorized into five cognitive dimensions and three spatial relation expressions. A comprehensive evaluation of 33 VLMs reveals a significant performance disparity with humans: even large-scale models struggle to exceed 54.1% accuracy, remaining 34.2% below human performance. By contrast, small-scale fine-tuned VLMs achieve over 60.0% accuracy, highlighting the necessity of our benchmark. Further analyses indicate the task correlations and fundamental cognitive disparity between VLMs and human-like reasoning.</p></details> |  |

While empirical studies have proposed various approaches that primarily focus on enforcing cross-view constraints at photometric level, few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view setting. In this work, we propose GeoSurDepth, a framework that leverages geometry consistency as the primary cue for surround-view depth estimation. Concretely, we utilize vision foundation models as pseudo geometry priors and feature representation enhancement tool to guide the network to maintain surface normal consistency in spatial 3D space and regularize object- and texture-consistent depth estimation in 2D. In addition, we introduce a novel view synthesis pipeline where 2D-3D lifting is achieved with dense depth reconstructed via spatial warping, encouraging additional photometric supervision across temporal and spatial contexts, and compensating for the limitations of target-view image reconstruction. Finally, a newly-proposed adaptive joint motion learning strategy enables the network to adaptively emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning. Extensive experiments on KITTI, DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate that GeoSurDepth achieves SoTA performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our framework highlights the importance of exploiting geometry coherence and consistency for robust self-supervised depth estimation.</p></details> |  |

However, the AIS data needs to be cleaned, processed, and stored before being usable. This paper presents a system consisting of an efficient and modular ETL process for loading AIS data, as well as a distributed spatial data warehouse storing the trajectories of ships. To efficiently analyze a large set of ships, a raster approach to querying the AIS data is proposed. A spatially partitioned data warehouse with a granularized cell representation and heatmap presentation is designed, developed, and evaluated. Currently the data warehouse stores ~312 million kilometers of ship trajectories and more than +8 billion rows in the largest table. It is found that searching the cell representation is faster than searching the trajectory representation. Further, we show that the spatially divided shards enable a consistently good scale-up for both cell and heatmap analytics in large areas, ranging between 354% to 1164% with a 5x increase in workers</p></details> |  |

Mainstream approaches based on modality-invariant and modality-specific factorization or on complex fusion still rely on spatiotemporal mixed modeling. This ignores spatiotemporal heterogeneity, leading to spatiotemporal information asymmetry and thus limited performance. Hence, we propose TSDA, Temporal-Spatial Decouple before Act, which explicitly decouples each modality into temporal dynamics and spatial structural context before any interaction. For every modality, a temporal encoder and a spatial encoder project signals into separate temporal and spatial body. Factor-Consistent Cross-Modal Alignment then aligns temporal features only with their temporal counterparts across modalities, and spatial features only with their spatial counterparts. Factor specific supervision and decorrelation regularization reduce cross factor leakage while preserving complementarity. A Gated Recouple module subsequently recouples the aligned streams for task. Extensive experiments show that TSDA outperforms baselines. Ablation analysis studies confirm the necessity and interpretability of the design.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This study has been accepted by IEEE ICASSP2026</p></details> |

However, the global organization of such intra-urban centers remains poorly understood due to the lack of consistent, comparable data. Here we develop a scalable geospatial framework to identify intra-urban activity centers worldwide using nighttime light observations. Applying this approach to more than 9,500 cities, we construct a high-resolution global dataset of over 15,000 centers. We uncover a striking regularity: despite vast differences in city size, regional development, and population density, the built-up area associated with individual centers remains remarkably consistent. Across cities, total urban area scales proportionally with the number of centers, yielding a stable mean spatial footprint. This regularity holds at the micro-scale, where Voronoi-based service areas exhibit a characteristic size that is persistent across countries and independent of local population concentration. As a geometric consequence, this polycentric multiplication maintains stable average distances to the nearest center as cities expand, preventing the accessibility decay inherent in monocentric growth. These findings reveal a universal organizing principle whereby urban expansion is accommodated through the replication of activity centers with a consistent spatial extent, providing a new empirical foundation for understanding the nature of urban growth.</p></details> |  |

However, to meet emerging demands such as high-frequency operation, wide bandwidths, co-existence, integrated sensing, and resilience to dynamic interference, future systems must exhibit both scalability and spectral agility. These requirements place increasing pressure on the underlying processing hardware to be both efficient and reconfigurable. This paper proposes a custom-designed spatial array architecture that serves as a reconfigurable, general-purpose core optimized for a class of wireless kernels that commonly arise in diverse communications and sensing tasks. The proposed spatial array is evaluated against specialized cores for each kernel using High-Level Synthesis (HLS). Both the reconfigurable and specialized designs are synthesized in a 32 nm process to assess latency, throughput, area, and power in realistic processes. The results identify conditions under which general-purpose systolic architectures can approach the efficiency of specialized cores, thereby paving the way toward more scalable and agile systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented in 2025 Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers</p></details> |

Object detectors may miss targets or return multiple plausible detections, and simple geometric tests can become ambiguous in borderline cases. Spatial evaluation is naturally a selective prediction problem, the checker may abstain when evidence is weak and report confidence so that results can be interpreted as a risk coverage tradeoff rather than a single score. We introduce SpatialBench-UC, a small, reproducible benchmark for pairwise spatial relations. The benchmark contains 200 prompts (50 object pairs times 4 relations) grouped into 100 counterfactual pairs obtained by swapping object roles. We release a benchmark package, versioned prompts, pinned configs, per-sample checker outputs, and report tables, enabling reproducible and auditable comparisons across models. We also include a lightweight human audit used to calibrate the checker's abstention margin and confidence threshold. We evaluate three baselines, Stable Diffusion 1.5, SD 1.5 BoxDiff, and SD 1.4 GLIGEN. The checker reports pass rate and coverage as well as conditional pass rates on decided samples. The results show that grounding methods substantially improve both pass rate and coverage, while abstention remains a dominant factor due mainly to missing detections.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, includes figures and tables</p></details> |
| **[A Two-Stage Bayesian Framework for Multi-Fidelity Online Updating of Spatial Fragility Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13396v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses a long-standing gap in natural hazard modeling by unifying physics-based fragility functions with real-time post-disaster observations. It introduces a Bayesian framework that continuously refines regional vulnerability estimates as new data emerges. The framework reformulates physics-informed fragility estimates into a Probit-Normal (PN) representation that captures aleatory variability and epistemic uncertainty in an analytically tractable form. Stage 1 performs local Bayesian updating by moment-matching PN marginals to Beta surrogates that preserve their probability shapes, enabling conjugate Beta-Bernoulli updates with soft, multi-fidelity observations. Fidelity weights encode source reliability, and the resulting Beta posteriors are re-projected into PN form, producing heteroscedastic fragility estimates whose variances reflect data quality and coverage. Stage 2 assimilates these heteroscedastic observations within a probit-warped Gaussian Process (GP), which propagates information from high-fidelity sites to low-fidelity and unobserved regions through a composite kernel that links space, archetypes, and correlated damage states. The framework is applied to the 2011 Joplin tornado, where wind-field priors and computer-vision damage assessments are fused under varying assumptions about tornado width, sampling strategy, and observation completeness. Results show that the method corrects biased priors, propagates information spatially, and produces uncertainty-aware exceedance probabilities that support real-time situational awareness.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables.

| **[MultiST: A Cross-Attention-Based Multimodal Model for Spatial Transcriptomic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13331v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables transcriptome-wide profiling while preserving the spatial context of tissues, offering unprecedented opportunities to study tissue organization and cell-cell interactions in situ. Despite recent advances, existing methods often lack effective integration of histological morphology with molecular profiles, relying on shallow fusion strategies or omitting tissue images altogether, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous spatial domain boundaries. To address this challenge, we propose MultiST, a unified multimodal framework that jointly models spatial topology, gene expression, and tissue morphology through cross-attention-based fusion. MultiST employs graph-based gene encoders with adversarial alignment to learn robust spatial representations, while integrating color-normalized histological features to capture molecular-morphological dependencies and refine domain boundaries. We evaluated the proposed method on 13 diverse ST datasets spanning two organs, including human brain cortex and breast cancer tissue. MultiST yields spatial domains with clearer and more coherent boundaries than existing methods, leading to more stable pseudotime trajectories and more biologically interpretable cell-cell interaction patterns. The MultiST framework and source code are available at https://github.com/LabJunBMI/MultiST.git.</p></details> |  |

We call this ability Causal Spatial Reasoning. However, current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) cannot do this, as they remain largely restricted to static spatial perception, struggling to answer "what-if" questions in a 3D scene. We introduce CausalSpatial, a diagnostic benchmark evaluating whether models can anticipate consequences of object motions across four tasks: Collision, Compatibility, Occlusion, and Trajectory. Results expose a severe gap: humans score 84% while GPT-5 achieves only 54%. Why do MLLMs fail? Our analysis uncovers a fundamental deficiency: models over-rely on textual chain-of-thought reasoning that drifts from visual evidence, producing fluent but spatially ungrounded hallucinations. To address this, we propose the Causal Object World model (COW), a framework that externalizes the simulation process by generating videos of hypothetical dynamics. With explicit visual cues of causality, COW enables models to ground their reasoning in physical reality rather than linguistic priors. We make the dataset and code publicly available here: https://github.com/CausalSpatial/CausalSpatial</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available: https://github.com/CausalSpatial/CausalSpatial</p></details> |

While recent graph-based methods modeling cell-cell interactions have improved clustering accuracy, they remain limited in two key aspects: (i) reliance on local aggregation in static graphs often fails to capture robust global topological structures (e.g., loops and voids) and is vulnerable to noisy edges; and (ii) dimensionality reduction techniques frequently neglect spatial coherence, causing physically adjacent spots to be erroneously separated in the latent space. To overcome these challenges, we propose SPHENIC, a Spatial Persistent Homology-Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, it explicitly incorporates topology-invariant features into the clustering network to ensure robust representation learning against noise. Furthermore, we design a dual-regularized optimization module that imposes spatial constraints alongside distributional optimization, ensuring that the embedding space preserves the physical proximity of cells. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPHENIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.19%-9.14%, validating its superiority in characterizing complex tissue architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Listening tests are currently the standard but remain costly in terms of time and resources. Several models predicting subjective scores have been proposed, but they do not generalize well to real-world signals. In this paper, we propose QASTAnet (Quality Assessment for SpaTial Audio network), a new metric based on a deep neural network, specialized on spatial audio (ambisonics and binaural). As training data is scarce, we aim for the model to be trainable with a small amount of data. To do so, we propose to rely on expert modeling of the low-level auditory system and use a neurnal network to model the high-level cognitive function of the quality judgement. We compare its performance to two reference metrics on a wide range of content types (speech, music, ambiance, anechoic, reverberated) and focusing on codec artifacts. Results demonstrate that QASTAnet overcomes the aforementioned limitations of the existing methods. The strong correlation between the proposed metric prediction and subjective scores makes it a good candidate for comparing codecs in their development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor typo corrections, figure updates for clarity, add two references, no modifications of the results and their interpretation</p></details> |

Despite long-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and accurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and random shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal Perception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical motion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in an end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to capture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained perception progressively refines the object-level features using previous outputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation. Because there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation, we manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on GasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such as gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)</p></details> |

While recent vision large models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding, they remain fundamentally 2D perceivers and struggle with genuine 3D reasoning. We introduce Think3D, a framework that enables VLM agents to think with 3D space. By leveraging 3D reconstruction models that recover point clouds and camera poses from images or videos, Think3D allows the agent to actively manipulate space through camera-based operations and ego/global-view switching, transforming spatial reasoning into an interactive 3D chain-of-thought process. Without additional training, Think3D significantly improves the spatial reasoning performance of advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro, yielding average gains of +7.8% on BLINK Multi-view and MindCube, and +4.7% on VSI-Bench. We further show that smaller models, which struggle with spatial exploration, benefit significantly from a reinforcement learning policy that enables the model to select informative viewpoints and operations. With RL, the benefit from tool usage increases from +0.7% to +6.8%. Our findings demonstrate that training-free, tool-augmented spatial exploration is a viable path toward more flexible and human-like 3D reasoning in multimodal agents, establishing a new dimension of multimodal intelligence.

This paper introduces a new paradigm for constructing asymmetric space-time covariances, which we refer to as "reflective asymmetric," by leveraging recently-introduced models for multivariate spatial data. We first provide new results for reflective asymmetric multivariate spatial models that extends their applicability. We then propose their asymmetric space-time extension, which come from a substantially different perspective than Lagrangian asymmetric space-time covariances. There are fewer parameters in the new models, one controls both the spatial and temporal marginal covariances, and the standard separable model is a special case. In simulation studies and analysis of the frequently-studied Irish wind data, these new models also improve model fit and prediction performance, and they can be easier to estimate. These features indicate broad applicability for improved analysis in environmental and other space-time data.</p></details> |  |

These challenges are especially relevant in spatio-temporal analyses, where their joint exploration remains limited. To study the effects of fine particulate matter on mortality among elderly people in Italy, we propose a Bayesian spatial dynamic generalized linear model that captures the non-linear exposure-outcome association and decomposes the exposure effect across fine and coarse spatio-temporal scales of variation. Together, these features allow reducing the spatio-temporal confounding bias and recovering the shape of the association, as demonstrated through simulation studies. The real-data analysis reveals a clear temporal pattern in the exposure effect, with peaks during summer months. We argue that this finding may be due to interactions of particulate matter with air temperature and unmeasured confounders.</p></details> | 45 pages, 9 figures |

These drawbacks lead to larger data distribution shift, making features less stable for MI-EEG tasks.To address these problems, we introduce STGMFM, a tri-branch framework tailored for dry-electrode MI-EEG, which models complementary spatio-temporal dependencies via dual graph orders, and captures robust envelope dynamics with a multi-scale frequency mixing branch, motivated by the observation that amplitude envelopes are less sensitive to contact variability than instantaneous waveforms. Physiologically meaningful connectivity priors guide learning, and decision-level fusion consolidates a noise-tolerant consensus. On our collected dry-electrode MI-EEG, STGMFM consistently surpasses competitive CNN/Transformer/graph baselines. Codes are available at https://github.com/Tianyi-325/STGMFM.</p></details> |  |

Representative queries over such data include range queries, nearest neighbor queries, and join queries. However, formulating those queries usually requires domain-specific expertise and familiarity with executable query languages, which would be a challenging task for non-expert users. It leads to a great demand for well-supported natural language queries (NLQs) in spatio-temporal databases. To bridge the gap between non-experts and query plans in databases, we present NL4ST, an interactive tool that allows users to query spatio-temporal databases in natural language. NL4ST features a three-layer architecture: (i) knowledge base and corpus for knowledge preparation, (ii) natural language understanding for entity linking, and (iii) generating physical plans. Our demonstration will showcase how NL4ST provides effective spatio-temporal physical plans, verified by using four real and synthetic datasets. We make NL4ST online and provide the demo video at https://youtu.be/-J1R7R5WoqQ.</p></details> |  |
| **[UBATrack: Spatio-Temporal State Space Model for General Multi-Modal Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14799v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal object tracking has attracted considerable attention by integrating multiple complementary inputs (e.g., thermal, depth, and event data) to achieve outstanding performance. Although current general-purpose multi-modal trackers primarily unify various modal tracking tasks (i.e., RGB-Thermal infrared, RGB-Depth or RGB-Event tracking) through prompt learning, they still overlook the effective capture of spatio-temporal cues. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-modal tracking framework based on a mamba-style state space model, termed UBATrack. Our UBATrack comprises two simple yet effective modules: a Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) and a Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer. The former leverages Mamba's long-sequence modeling capability to jointly model cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal visual cues in an adapter-tuning manner. The latter further enhances multi-modal representation capacity across multiple feature dimensions to improve tracking robustness. In this way, UBATrack eliminates the need for costly full-parameter fine-tuning, thereby improving the training efficiency of multi-modal tracking algorithms. Experiments show that UBATrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks, achieving outstanding results on the LasHeR, RGBT234, RGBT210, DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD22, and VisEvent datasets.</p></details> |  |

While multi-frame detection methods leverages temporal cues to improve upon single-frame approaches, existing methods still struggle with inefficient long-range dependency modeling and insufficient robustness. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel scheme for ISTD, realized through a sparse frames-based spatio-temporal semantic feedback network named FeedbackSTS-Det. The core of our approach is a novel spatio-temporal semantic feedback strategy with a closed-loop semantic association mechanism, which consists of paired forward and backward refinement modules that work cooperatively across the encoder and decoder. Moreover, both modules incorporate an embedded sparse semantic module (SSM), which performs structured sparse temporal modeling to capture long-range dependencies with low computational cost. This integrated design facilitates robust implicit inter-frame registration and continuous semantic refinement, effectively suppressing false alarms. Furthermore, our overall procedure maintains a consistent training-inference pipeline, which ensures reliable performance transfer and increases model robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of FeedbackSTS-Det.

However, most existing video customization methods rely on reference images or task-specific temporal priors, failing to fully exploit the rich spatio-temporal information inherent in videos, thereby limiting flexibility and generalization in video generation. To address these limitations, we propose OmniTransfer, a unified framework for spatio-temporal video transfer. It leverages multi-view information across frames to enhance appearance consistency and exploits temporal cues to enable fine-grained temporal control. To unify various video transfer tasks, OmniTransfer incorporates three key designs: Task-aware Positional Bias that adaptively leverages reference video information to improve temporal alignment or appearance consistency; Reference-decoupled Causal Learning separating reference and target branches to enable precise reference transfer while improving efficiency; and Task-adaptive Multimodal Alignment using multimodal semantic guidance to dynamically distinguish and tackle different tasks. Extensive experiments show that OmniTransfer outperforms existing methods in appearance (ID and style) and temporal transfer (camera movement and video effects), while matching pose-guided methods in motion transfer without using pose, establishing a new paradigm for flexible, high-fidelity video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github Page: https://pangzecheung.github.io/OmniTransfer/</p></details> |
| **[Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14115v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Liquid Time-Constant networks (LTCs), a type of continuous-time graph neural network, excel at modeling irregularly-sampled dynamics but are fundamentally confined to Euclidean space. This limitation introduces significant geometric distortion when representing real-world graphs with inherent non-Euclidean structures (e.g., hierarchies and cycles), degrading representation quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for RLSTG, extending stability theorems of LTCs to the Riemannian domain and quantifying its expressive power via state trajectory analysis. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that, by combining advanced temporal dynamics with a Riemannian spatial representation, RLSTG achieves superior performance on graphs with complex structures.

Existing evaluation metrics primarily focus on perceptual quality or reconstruction fidelity, and are not designed to assess whether a set of sampled frames adequately captures informative and representative video content. We propose Spatio-Temporal Entropy Coverage (STEC), a simple and non-reference metric for evaluating the effectiveness of video frame sampling. STEC builds upon Spatio-Temporal Frame Entropy (STFE), which measures per-frame spatial information via entropy-based structural complexity, and evaluates sampled frames based on their temporal coverage and redundancy. By jointly modeling spatial information strength, temporal dispersion, and non-redundancy, STEC provides a principled and lightweight measure of sampling quality. Experiments on the MSR-VTT test-1k benchmark demonstrate that STEC clearly differentiates common sampling strategies, including random, uniform, and content-aware methods. We further show that STEC reveals robustness patterns across individual videos that are not captured by average performance alone, highlighting its practical value as a general-purpose evaluation tool for efficient video understanding. We emphasize that STEC is not designed to predict downstream task accuracy, but to provide a task-agnostic diagnostic signal for analyzing frame sampling behavior under constrained budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper corresponds to the camera-ready version of a WACV 2026 Workshop paper</p></details> |

Point processes specified on linear networks can provide a more accurate description of crime incidents by considering the geometry of the city. We propose a spatio-temporal Dirichlet process mixture model on a linear network to analyze crime events in Valencia, Spain. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with a Dirichlet process prior to automatically detect space-time clusters of the events and adopt a convolution kernel estimator to account for the network structure in the city. From the fitted model, we provide crime hotspot visualizations that can inform social interventions to prevent crime incidents. Furthermore, we study the relationships between the detected cluster centers and the city's amenities, which provides an intuitive explanation of criminal contagion.</p></details> |  |

While advances in semantic scene representations have enriched robotic scene understanding, current approaches lack a connection between spatial features and dynamic events; e.g., connecting the blue mug to the event washing a mug. In this work, we introduce the event-grounding graph (EGG), a framework grounding event interactions to spatial features of a scene. This representation allows robots to perceive, reason, and respond to complex spatio-temporal queries. Experiments using real robotic data demonstrate EGG's capability to retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human inquiries concerning the environment and events within. Furthermore, the EGG framework's source code and evaluation dataset are released as open-source at: https://github.com/aalto-intelligent-robotics/EGG.</p></details> | Submitted to RA-L |
| **[A Graph Prompt Fine-Tuning Method for WSN Spatio-Temporal Correlation Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12745v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection of multi-temporal modal data in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can provide an important guarantee for reliable network operation. Existing anomaly detection methods in multi-temporal modal data scenarios have the problems of insufficient extraction of spatio-temporal correlation features, high cost of anomaly sample category annotation, and imbalance of anomaly samples. In this paper, a graph neural network anomaly detection backbone network incorporating spatio-temporal correlation features and a multi-task self-supervised training strategy of "pre-training - graph prompting - fine-tuning" are designed for the characteristics of WSN graph structure data. First, the anomaly detection backbone network is designed by improving the Mamba model based on a multi-scale strategy and inter-modal fusion method, and combining it with a variational graph convolution module, which is capable of fully extracting spatio-temporal correlation features in the multi-node, multi-temporal modal scenarios of WSNs. Secondly, we design a three-subtask learning "pre-training" method with no-negative comparative learning, prediction, and reconstruction to learn generic features of WSN data samples from unlabeled data, and design a "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning. The model is fine-tuned through the "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning model to complete the parameter fine-tuning, thereby reducing the training cost and enhancing the detection generalization performance. The F1 metrics obtained from experiments on the public dataset and the actual collected dataset are up to 91.30% and 92.31%, respectively, which provides better detection performance and generalization ability than existing methods designed by the method.</p></details> |  |
| **[CurConMix+: A Unified Spatio-Temporal Framework for Hierarchical Surgical Workflow Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12312v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical action triplet recognition aims to understand fine-grained surgical behaviors by modeling the interactions among instruments, actions, and anatomical targets. Despite its clinical importance for workflow analysis and skill assessment, progress has been hindered by severe class imbalance, subtle visual variations, and the semantic interdependence among triplet components. Existing approaches often address only a subset of these challenges rather than tackling them jointly, which limits their ability to form a holistic understanding. This study builds upon CurConMix, a spatial representation framework. At its core, a curriculum-guided contrastive learning strategy learns discriminative and progressively correlated features, further enhanced by structured hard-pair sampling and feature-level mixup. Its temporal extension, CurConMix+, integrates a Multi-Resolution Temporal Transformer (MRTT) that achieves robust, context-aware understanding by adaptively fusing multi-scale temporal features and dynamically balancing spatio-temporal cues. Furthermore, we introduce LLS48, a new, hierarchically annotated benchmark for complex laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy, providing step-, task-, and action-level annotations. Extensive experiments on CholecT45 and LLS48 demonstrate that CurConMix+ not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in triplet recognition, but also exhibits strong cross-level generalization, as its fine-grained features effectively transfer to higher-level phase and step recognition tasks. Together, the framework and dataset provide a unified foundation for hierarchy-aware, reproducible, and interpretable surgical workflow understanding. The code and dataset will be publicly released on GitHub to facilitate reproducibility and further research.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a topology-enhanced spatio-temporal feature fusion anomaly detection method, TE-MSTAD. First, building upon the RWKV model with linear attention mechanisms, a Cross-modal Feature Extraction (CFE) module is introduced to fully extract spatial correlation features among multiple nodes while reducing computational resource consumption. Second, a strategy is designed to construct an adjacency matrix by jointly learning spatial correlation from time-frequency domain features. Different graph neural networks are integrated to enhance spatial correlation feature extraction, thereby fully capturing spatial relationships among multiple nodes. Finally, a dual-branch network TE-MSTAD is designed for time-frequency domain feature fusion, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the time or frequency domain to improve WSN anomaly detection performance. Testing on both public and real-world datasets demonstrates that the TE-MSTAD model achieves F1 scores of 92.52% and 93.28%, respectively, exhibiting superior detection performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communication-Efficient Federated Learning by Exploiting Spatio-Temporal Correlations of Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10491v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Communication overhead is a critical challenge in federated learning, particularly in bandwidth-constrained networks. Although many methods have been proposed to reduce communication overhead, most focus solely on compressing individual gradients, overlooking the temporal correlations among them. Prior studies have shown that gradients exhibit spatial correlations, typically reflected in low-rank structures. Through empirical analysis, we further observe a strong temporal correlation between client gradients across adjacent rounds. Based on these observations, we propose GradESTC, a compression technique that exploits both spatial and temporal gradient correlations. GradESTC exploits spatial correlations to decompose each full gradient into a compact set of basis vectors and corresponding combination coefficients. By exploiting temporal correlations, only a small portion of the basis vectors need to be dynamically updated in each round. GradESTC significantly reduces communication overhead by transmitting lightweight combination coefficients and a limited number of updated basis vectors instead of the full gradients. Extensive experiments show that, upon reaching a target accuracy level near convergence, GradESTC reduces uplink communication by an average of 39.79% compared to the strongest baseline, while maintaining comparable convergence speed and final accuracy to uncompressed FedAvg. By effectively leveraging spatio-temporal gradient structures, GradESTC offers a practical and scalable solution for communication-efficient federated learning.</p></details> |  |

To better respond real-time user feedback, we have deployed an interactive recommender system (IRS) alongside our core homepage recommender system. This IRS is triggered by user click on homepage, and generates a series of highly relevant recommendations based on the clicked item to meet focused browsing demands. Different from traditional e-commerce RecSys, the full-screen UI and immersive swiping down functionality present two distinct challenges for regular ranking system. First, there exists explicit interference (overlap or conflicts) between ranking objectives, i.e., conversion, view and swipe down. This is because there are intrinsic behavioral co-occurrences under the premise of immersive browsing and swiping down functionality. Second, the ranking system is prone to temporal greedy traps in sequential recommendation slot transitions, which is caused by full-screen UI design. To alleviate these challenges, we propose a novel Spatio-temporal collaborative ranking (STCRank) framework to achieve collaboration between multi-objectives within one slot (spatial) and between multiple sequential recommondation slots. In multi-objective collaboration (MOC) module, we push Pareto frontier by mitigating the objective overlaps and conflicts. In multi-slot collaboration (MSC) module, we achieve global optima on overall sequential slots by dual-stage look-ahead ranking mechanism.

| **[STORM: A Spatio-Temporal Factor Model Based on Dual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders for Financial Trading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09468v4)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In financial trading, factor models are widely used to price assets and capture excess returns from mispricing. Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrackNetV5: Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement and Motion Direction Decoupling for Fast Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02789v4)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[U-MASK: User-adaptive Spatio-Temporal Masking for Personalized Mobile AI Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06867v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized mobile artificial intelligence applications are widely deployed, yet they are expected to infer user behavior from sparse and irregular histories under a continuously evolving spatio-temporal context. This setting induces a fundamental tension among three requirements, i.e., immediacy to adapt to recent behavior, stability to resist transient noise, and generalization to support long-horizon prediction and cold-start users. Most existing approaches satisfy at most two of these requirements, resulting in an inherent impossibility triangle in data-scarce, non-stationary personalization. To address this challenge, we model mobile behavior as a partially observed spatio-temporal tensor and unify short-term adaptation, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start recommendation as a conditional completion problem, where a user- and task-specific mask specifies which coordinates are treated as evidence. We propose U-MASK, a user-adaptive spatio-temporal masking method that allocates evidence budgets based on user reliability and task sensitivity. To enable mask generation under sparse observations, U-MASK learns a compact, task-agnostic user representation from app and location histories via U-SCOPE, which serves as the sole semantic conditioning signal. A shared diffusion transformer then performs mask-guided generative completion while preserving observed evidence, so personalization and task differentiation are governed entirely by the mask and the user representation. Experiments on real-world mobile datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across short-term prediction, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start settings, with the largest gains under severe data sparsity. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/NICE-HKU/U-MASK.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |
| **[LaST$_{0}$: Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought for Robotic Vision-Language-Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05248v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently demonstrated strong generalization capabilities in robotic manipulation. Some existing VLA approaches attempt to improve action accuracy by explicitly generating linguistic reasoning traces or future visual observations before action execution. However, explicit reasoning typically incurs non-negligible inference latency, which constrains the temporal resolution required for robotic manipulation. Moreover, such reasoning is confined to the linguistic space, imposing a representational bottleneck that struggles to faithfully capture ineffable physical attributes. To mitigate these limitations, we propose LaST$_0$, a framework that enables efficient reasoning before acting through a Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought (CoT), capturing fine-grained physical and robotic dynamics that are often difficult to verbalize. Specifically, we introduce a token-efficient latent CoT space that models future visual dynamics, 3D structural information, and robot proprioceptive states, and further extends these representations across time to enable temporally consistent implicit reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, LaST$_0$ adopts a dual-system architecture implemented via a Mixture-of-Transformers design, where a reasoning expert conducts low-frequency latent inference and an acting expert generates high-frequency actions conditioned on robotics-oriented latent representations. To facilitate coordination, LaST$_0$ is trained with heterogeneous operation frequencies, enabling adaptive switching between reasoning and action inference rates during deployment. Across ten simulated and six real-world manipulation tasks, LaST$_0$ improves mean success rates by 8% and 13% over prior VLA methods, respectively, while achieving substantially faster inference.

| **[SparseLaneSTP: Leveraging Spatio-Temporal Priors with Sparse Transformers for 3D Lane Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04968v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D lane detection has emerged as a critical challenge in autonomous driving, encompassing identification and localization of lane markings and the 3D road surface. Conventional 3D methods detect lanes from dense birds-eye-viewed (BEV) features, though erroneous transformations often result in a poor feature representation misaligned with the true 3D road surface. While recent sparse lane detectors have surpassed dense BEV approaches, they completely disregard valuable lane-specific priors. Furthermore, existing methods fail to utilize historic lane observations, which yield the potential to resolve ambiguities in situations of poor visibility. To address these challenges, we present SparseLaneSTP, a novel method that integrates both geometric properties of the lane structure and temporal information into a sparse lane transformer. It introduces a new lane-specific spatio-temporal attention mechanism, a continuous lane representation tailored for sparse architectures as well as temporal regularization. Identifying weaknesses of existing 3D lane datasets, we also introduce a precise and consistent 3D lane dataset using a simple yet effective auto-labeling strategy. Our experimental section proves the benefits of our contributions and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across all detection and error metrics on existing 3D lane detection benchmarks as well as on our novel dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025</p></details> |

However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework. Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points. Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel Graph Enhanced Spatio-temporal Hierarchical Inference Network (GEnSHIN) to handle the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic flow prediction. The model integrates three innovative designs: 1) An attention-enhanced Graph Convolutional Recurrent Unit (GCRU), which strengthens the modeling capability for long-term temporal dependencies by introducing Transformer modules; 2) An asymmetric dual-embedding graph generation mechanism, which leverages the real road network and data-driven latent asymmetric topology to generate graph structures that better fit the characteristics of actual traffic flow; 3) A dynamic memory bank module, which utilizes learnable traffic pattern prototypes to provide personalized traffic pattern representations for each sensor node, and introduces a lightweight graph updater during the decoding phase to adapt to dynamic changes in road network states. Extensive experiments on the public dataset METR-LA show that GEnSHIN achieves or surpasses the performance of comparative models across multiple metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Notably, the model demonstrates excellent prediction stability during peak morning and evening traffic hours. Ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of each core module and its contribution to the final performance.</p></details> |  |

This capability is vital for high-stakes decision-making in systems such as traffic networks, power grids, and disease propagation. However, the field remains underdeveloped because most existing works prioritize predictive accuracy over reasoning. To address the gap, we introduce ST-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four core tasks, including etiological reasoning, entity identification, correlation reasoning, and in-context forecasting, developed via a network SDE-based multi-agent data synthesis pipeline. We then propose STReasoner, which empowers LLM to integrate time series, graph structure, and text for explicit reasoning. To promote spatially grounded logic, we introduce S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that rewards performance gains specifically attributable to spatial information. Experiments show that STReasoner achieves average accuracy gains between 17% and 135% at only 0.004X the cost of proprietary models and generalizes robustly to real-world data.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, we release our code publicly at https://github.com/LingFengGold/STReasoner</p></details> |
| **[Learning and Optimizing the Efficacy of Spatio-Temporal Task Allocation under Temporal and Resource Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02505v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex multi-robot missions often require heterogeneous teams to jointly optimize task allocation, scheduling, and path planning to improve team performance under strict constraints. We formalize these complexities into a new class of problems, dubbed Spatio-Temporal Efficacy-optimized Allocation for Multi-robot systems (STEAM). STEAM builds upon trait-based frameworks that model robots using their capabilities (e.g., payload and speed), but goes beyond the typical binary success-failure model by explicitly modeling the efficacy of allocations as trait-efficacy maps. These maps encode how the aggregated capabilities assigned to a task determine performance. Further, STEAM accommodates spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). To solve STEAM problems, we contribute a novel algorithm named Efficacy-optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (E-ITAGS) that simultaneously optimizes task performance and respects time budgets by interleaving task allocation, scheduling, and path planning. Motivated by the fact that trait-efficacy maps are difficult, if not impossible, to specify, E-ITAGS efficiently learns them using a realizability-aware active learning module. Our approach is realizability-aware since it explicitly accounts for the fact that not all combinations of traits are realizable by the robots available during learning. Further, we derive experimentally-validated bounds on E-ITAGS' suboptimality with respect to efficacy. Detailed numerical simulations and experiments using an emergency response domain demonstrate that E-ITAGS generates allocations of higher efficacy compared to baselines, while respecting resource and spatio-temporal constraints. We also show that our active learning approach is sample efficient and establishes a principled tradeoff between data and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>The j...</summary><p>The journal extension version of our conference paper: arXiv:2404.07902, which has been accepted by ISRR 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Approach For High-Resolution Gridded Monsoon Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02445v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) is a critical climate phenomenon, fundamentally impacting the agriculture, economy, and water security of over a billion people. Traditional long-range forecasting, whether statistical or dynamical, has predominantly focused on predicting a single, spatially-averaged seasonal value, lacking the spatial detail essential for regional-level resource management. To address this gap, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that reframes gridded monsoon prediction as a spatio-temporal computer vision task. We treat multi-variable, pre-monsoon atmospheric and oceanic fields as a sequence of multi-channel images, effectively creating a video-like input tensor. Using 85 years of ERA5 reanalysis data for predictors and IMD rainfall data for targets, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture to learn the complex mapping from the five-month pre-monsoon period (January-May) to a high-resolution gridded rainfall pattern for the subsequent monsoon season. Our framework successfully produces distinct forecasts for each of the four monsoon months (June-September) as well as the total seasonal average, demonstrating its utility for both intra-seasonal and seasonal outlooks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 Tables, to be submitted to "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing"</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-temporal modeling and forecasting with Fourier neural operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01813v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal process models are often used for modeling dynamic physical and biological phenomena that evolve across space and time. These phenomena may exhibit environmental heterogeneity and complex interactions that are difficult to capture using traditional statistical process models such as Gaussian processes. This work proposes the use of Fourier neural operators (FNOs) for constructing statistical dynamical spatio-temporal models for forecasting. An FNO is a flexible mapping of functions that approximates the solution operator of possibly unknown linear or non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) in a computationally efficient manner. It does so using samples of inputs and their respective outputs, and hence explicit knowledge of the underlying PDE is not required. Through simulations from a nonlinear PDE with known solution, we compare FNO forecasts to those from state-of-the-art statistical spatio-temporal-forecasting methods. Further, using sea surface temperature data over the Atlantic Ocean and precipitation data across Europe, we demonstrate the ability of FNO-based dynamic spatio-temporal (DST) statistical modeling to capture complex real-world spatio-temporal dependencies. Using collections of testing instances, we show that the FNO-DST forecasts are accurate with valid uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |

However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echo State Networks for Spatio-Temporal Area-Level Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10641v2)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal area-level datasets play a critical role in official statistics, providing valuable insights for policy-making and regional planning. Accurate modeling and forecasting of these datasets can be extremely useful for policymakers to develop informed strategies for future planning. Echo State Networks (ESNs) are efficient methods for capturing nonlinear temporal dynamics and generating forecasts. However, ESNs lack a direct mechanism to account for the neighborhood structure inherent in area-level data. Ignoring these spatial relationships can significantly compromise the accuracy and utility of forecasts. In this paper, we incorporate approximate graph spectral filters at the input stage of the ESN, thereby improving forecast accuracy while preserving the model's computational efficiency during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Eurostat's tourism occupancy dataset and show how it can support more informed decision-making in policy and planning contexts.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Damba-ST: Domain-Adaptive Mamba for Efficient Urban Spatio-Temporal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18939v3)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However, directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining or fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2026</p></details> |

Rather than relying on inefficient standard im2col-like implementations (e.g., spatial convolutions, depthwise convolutions and feature-shifting mechanisms) or hardware-specific CUDA kernels (e.g., deformable and neighborhood attention), which often suffer from limited portability across non-CUDA devices, we reorganize the local sampling process through a direction-based sampling perspective. Specifically, we implement a non-parametric sampling mechanism that enables dynamically varying sampling regions. This approach provides the flexibility to adapt to diverse spatial structures without the computational costs of parametric layers and the need for model retraining. To further enhance feature coherence across frames, we design a supervised spatio-temporal contrastive learning scheme that enforces consistency in feature representations. In addition, we introduce a publicly available benchmark dataset for multi-object segmentation in X-ray angiography videos (MOSXAV), featuring detailed, manually labeled segmentation ground truth. Extensive experiments on the CADICA, XACV, and MOSXAV datasets show that our proposed FSVOS method outperforms current state-of-the-art video segmentation methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and generalization capability (i.e., seen and unseen categories). This work offers enhanced flexibility and potential for a wide range of clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMBWatch -- a Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network approach to detect Illicit Massage Business](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00075v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Illicit Massage Businesses (IMBs) are a covert and persistent form of organized exploitation that operate under the facade of legitimate wellness services while facilitating human trafficking, sexual exploitation, and coerced labor. Detecting IMBs is difficult due to encoded digital advertisements, frequent changes in personnel and locations, and the reuse of shared infrastructure such as phone numbers and addresses. Traditional approaches, including community tips and regulatory inspections, are largely reactive and ineffective at revealing the broader operational networks traffickers rely on. To address these challenges, we introduce IMBWatch, a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) framework for large-scale IMB detection. IMBWatch constructs dynamic graphs from open-source intelligence, including scraped online advertisements, business license records, and crowdsourced reviews. Nodes represent heterogeneous entities such as businesses, aliases, phone numbers, and locations, while edges capture spatio-temporal and relational patterns, including co-location, repeated phone usage, and synchronized advertising. The framework combines graph convolutional operations with temporal attention mechanisms to model the evolution of IMB networks over time and space, capturing patterns such as intercity worker movement, burner phone rotation, and coordinated advertising surges. Experiments on real-world datasets from multiple U.S. cities show that IMBWatch outperforms baseline models, achieving higher accuracy and F1 scores. Beyond performance gains, IMBWatch offers improved interpretability, providing actionable insights to support proactive and targeted interventions. The framework is scalable, adaptable to other illicit domains, and released with anonymized data and open-source code to support reproducible research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI AISI 2026</p></details> |

The advection model with a single constant velocity is interpretable but physically limited by its perfect correlation over time. This work aims to bridge the gap between this simple framework and its physically realistic extensions. Our guiding principle is to introduce a spatial correlation structure that vanishes over time. To achieve this, we present two distinct approaches. The first constructs complex velocity structures, either through superpositions of advection components or by allowing the velocity to vary locally. The second is a spectral technique that replaces the singular spectrum of rigid advection with a more flexible form, introducing temporal decorrelation controlled by parameters. We accompany these models with efficient simulation algorithms and demonstrate their success in replicating complex dynamics, such as tropical cyclones and the solutions of partial differential equations. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of the proposed framework by comparing its simulations to real-world precipitation data from Hurricane Florence.</p></details> |  |

Although advanced Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain: (i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns; and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (AI for Social Impact)</p></details> |

Integrating data from satellite products and ground monitors are increasingly used to produce exposure surfaces. However, spatio-temporal misalignment often induced from missing data introduces substantial uncertainty and reduces predictive accuracy. We propose a Bayesian weighted predictor regression framework that models spatio-temporal relationships when predictors are observed on irregular supports or have substantial missing data, and are not concurrent with the outcome. The key feature of our model is a spatio-temporal kernel that aggregates the predictor over local space-time neighborhoods, built directly into the likelihood, eliminating any separate gap-filling or forced data alignment stage. We introduce a numerical approximation using a Voronoi-based spatial quadrature combined with irregular temporal increments for estimation under data missingness and misalignment. We showed that misspecification of the spatial and temporal lags induced bias in the mean and parameter estimates, indicating the need for principled parameter selection. Simulation studies confirmed these findings, where careful tuning was critical to control bias and achieve accurate prediction, while the proposed quadrature performed well under severe missingness. As an illustrative application, we estimated fine particulate matter (PM$_{2.5}$) in northern California using satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and wildfire smoke plume indicators. Relative to a traditional collocated linear model, our approach improved out-of-sample predictive performance, reduced uncertainty, and yielded robust temporal predictions and spatial surface estimation. Our framework is extensible to additional spatio-temporally varying covariates and other kernel families.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, Updated results section</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking the Spatio-Temporal Alignment of End-to-End 3D Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23635v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal alignment is crucial for temporal modeling of end-to-end (E2E) perception in autonomous driving (AD), providing valuable structural and textural prior information. Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%. When semantics are corrupted (nuScenes-C), the enhancement of motion modeling by HAT enables more robust perception and planning in the E2E AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

This study develops long-term forecasts of monthly rainfall across 19 districts of West Bengal using a century-scale dataset spanning 1900-2019. Daily rainfall records are aggregated into monthly series, resulting in 120 years of observations for each district. The forecasting task involves predicting the next 108 months (9 years, 2011-2019) while accounting for temporal dependencies and spatial interactions among districts. To address the nonlinear and complex structure of rainfall dynamics, we propose a hierarchical modeling framework that combines regression-based forecasting of yearly features with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for monthly prediction. Yearly features, such as annual totals, quarterly proportions, variability measures, skewness, and extremes, are first forecasted using regression models that incorporate both own lags and neighboring-district lags. These forecasts are then integrated as auxiliary inputs into an MLP model, which captures nonlinear temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in the monthly series. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical regression-MLP architecture provides robust long-term spatio-temporal forecasts, offering valuable insights for agriculture, irrigation planning, and water conservation strategies.</p></details> | 25 pages, 22 figures |

Hence, they are critical components of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. While many existing systems depend on multiple sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam videos presents a more challenging, yet more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate improved spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to enhance state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets (DAD, DoTA and DADA) show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-accident scores than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[AnchorGK: Anchor-based Incremental and Stratified Graph Learning Framework for Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21569v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal kriging is a fundamental problem in sensor networks, driven by the sparsity of deployed sensors and the resulting missing observations. Although recent approaches model spatial and temporal correlations, they often under-exploit two practical characteristics of real deployments: the sparse spatial distribution of locations and the heterogeneous availability of auxiliary features across locations. To address these challenges, we propose AnchorGK, an Anchor-based Incremental and Stratified Graph Learning framework for inductive spatio-temporal kriging. AnchorGK introduces anchor locations to stratify the data in a principled manner. Anchors are constructed according to feature availability, and strata are then formed around these anchors. This stratification serves two complementary roles. First, it explicitly represents and continuously updates correlations between unobserved regions and surrounding observed locations within a graph learning framework. Second, it enables the systematic use of all available features across strata via an incremental representation mechanism, mitigating feature incompleteness without discarding informative signals. Building on the stratified structure, we design a dual-view graph learning layer that jointly aggregates feature-relevant and location-relevant information, learning stratum-specific representations that support accurate inference under inductive settings. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that AnchorGK consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for spatio-temporal kriging.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DynAttn, an interpretable dynamic-attention forecasting framework for high-dimensional spatio-temporal count processes. DynAttn combines rolling-window estimation, shared elastic-net feature gating, a compact weight-tied self-attention encoder, and a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) likelihood. This architecture produces calibrated multi-horizon forecasts of expected casualties and exceedance probabilities, while retaining transparent diagnostics through feature gates, ablation analysis, and elasticity measures. We evaluate DynAttn using global country-level and high-resolution PRIO-grid-level conflict data from the VIEWS forecasting system, benchmarking it against established statistical and machine-learning approaches, including DynENet, LSTM, Prophet, PatchTST, and the official VIEWS baseline. Across forecast horizons from one to twelve months, DynAttn consistently achieves substantially higher predictive accuracy, with particularly large gains in sparse grid-level settings where competing models often become unstable or degrade sharply. Beyond predictive performance, DynAttn enables structured interpretation of regional conflict dynamics. In our application, cross-regional analyses show that short-run conflict persistence and spatial diffusion form the core predictive backbone, while climate stress acts either as a conditional amplifier or a primary driver depending on the conflict theater.</p></details> |  |

Despite the advances in this field, the complex and stochastic nature of this task still poses challenges to existing approaches. Specifically, deterministic models tend to produce blurry predictions while generative models often struggle with poor accuracy. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective model architecture termed STLDM, a diffusion-based model that learns the latent representation from end to end alongside both the Variational Autoencoder and the conditioning network. STLDM decomposes this task into two stages: a deterministic forecasting stage handled by the conditioning network, and an enhancement stage performed by the latent diffusion model. Experimental results on multiple radar datasets demonstrate that STLDM achieves superior performance compared to the state of the art, while also improving inference efficiency. The code is available in https://github.com/sqfoo/stldm_official.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR. Camera-ready submission</p></details> |

We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.</p></details> |  |

Although many existing methods utilize multi-head attention mechanisms and message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture both spatial and temporal relations, these approaches encode temporal and spatial relations independently, and reflect the graph's topological characteristics in a limited manner. In this work, we introduce the Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer), a novel spatio-temporal GNN based on topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks based on MLPs: A temporal block for capturing temporal properties, a message-passing block for encapsulating spatial information, and a cycle message-passing block for enriching topological information through cyclic subgraphs. We bolster the effectiveness of Cy2Mixer with mathematical evidence emphasizing that our cycle message-passing block is capable of offering differentiated information to the deep learning model compared to the message-passing block. Furthermore, empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy of the Cy2Mixer, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances across various spatio-temporal benchmark datasets.

In contrast, many real-world systems including maritime traffic lack such fixed anchors, making the construction of spatio-temporal graphs a fundamental challenge. Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies. We plan to employ two specialized LLM-based agents: \emph{Trajectory Synthesizer} and \emph{Anomaly Injector} to construct richer interaction contexts and generate semantically meaningful anomalies. We expect this benchmark to promote reproducibility and to foster methodological advances in anomaly detection for non-grid spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop in AI for Science: The Reach and Limits of AI for Scientific Discovery</p></details> |

However, current thermal infrared satellite sensors cannot simultaneously achieve high spatial and temporal resolution. Spatio-temporal fusion (STF) techniques address this limitation by combining complementary satellite data, one with high spatial but low temporal resolution, and another with high temporal but low spatial resolution. Existing STF techniques, from classical models to modern deep learning (DL) architectures, were primarily developed for surface reflectance (SR). Their application to thermal data remains limited and often overlooks LST-specific spatial and temporal variability. This study provides a focused review of DL-based STF methods for LST. We present a formal mathematical definition of the thermal fusion task, propose a refined taxonomy of relevant DL methods, and analyze the modifications required when adapting SR-oriented models to LST. To support reproducibility and benchmarking, we introduce a new dataset comprising 51 Terra MODIS-Landsat LST pairs from 2013 to 2024, and evaluate representative models to explore their behavior on thermal data. The analysis highlights performance gaps, architecture sensitivities, and open research challenges. The dataset and accompanying resources are publicly available at https://github.com/Sofianebouaziz1/STF-LST.</p></details> |  |
| **[DK-STN: A Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network Model for MJO Forecast](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19506v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is fundamental for precipitation forecasting and disaster prevention. To date, long-term and accurate MJO prediction has remained a challenge for researchers. Conventional MJO prediction methods using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and highly unstable (most NWP methods are sensitive to seasons, with better MJO forecast results in winter). While existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods save resources and speed forecasting, their accuracy never reaches the 28 days predicted by the state-of-the-art NWP method, i.e., the operational forecasts from ECMWF, since neural networks cannot handle climate data effectively. In this paper, we present a Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network (DK-STN), a stable neural network model for accurate and efficient MJO forecasting. It combines the benefits of NWP and ANN methods and successfully improves the forecast accuracy of ANN methods while maintaining a high level of efficiency and stability. We begin with a spatial-temporal network (STN) and embed domain knowledge in it using two key methods: (i) applying a domain knowledge enhancement method and (ii) integrating a domain knowledge processing method into network training. We evaluated DK-STN with the 5th generation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and compared it with ECMWF. Given 7 days of climate data as input, DK-STN can generate reliable forecasts for the following 28 days in 1-2 seconds, with an error of only 2-3 days in different seasons. DK-STN significantly exceeds ECMWF in that its forecast accuracy is equivalent to ECMWF's, while its efficiency and stability are significantly superior.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Automatic Neuronal Activity Segmentation in Fast Four Dimensional Spatio-Temporal Fluorescence Imaging using Bayesian Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19032v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluorescence Microcopy Calcium Imaging is a fundamental tool to in-vivo record and analyze large scale neuronal activities simultaneously at a single cell resolution. Automatic and precise detection of behaviorally relevant neuron activity from the recordings is critical to study the mapping of brain activity in organisms. However a perpetual bottleneck to this problem is the manual segmentation which is time and labor intensive and lacks generalizability. To this end, we present a Bayesian Deep Learning Framework to detect neuronal activities in 4D spatio-temporal data obtained by light sheet microscopy. Our approach accounts for the use of temporal information by calculating pixel wise correlation maps and combines it with spatial information given by the mean summary image. The Bayesian framework not only produces probability segmentation maps but also models the uncertainty pertaining to active neuron detection. To evaluate the accuracy of our framework we implemented the test of reproducibility to assert the generalization of the network to detect neuron activity. The network achieved a mean Dice Score of 0.81 relative to the synthetic Ground Truth obtained by Otsu's method and a mean Dice Score of 0.79 between the first and second run for test of reproducibility. Our method successfully deployed can be used for rapid detection of active neuronal activities for behavioural studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Aware Network Based on Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Attention for Action Recognition in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18750v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action recognition is a critical task in video understanding, requiring the comprehensive capture of spatio-temporal cues across various scales. However, existing methods often overlook the multi-granularity nature of actions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Context-Aware Network (CAN). CAN consists of two core modules: the Multi-scale Temporal Cue Module (MTCM) and the Group Spatial Cue Module (GSCM). MTCM effectively extracts temporal cues at multiple scales, capturing both fast-changing motion details and overall action flow. GSCM, on the other hand, extracts spatial cues at different scales by grouping feature maps and applying specialized extraction methods to each group. Experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets (Something-Something V1 and V2, Diving48, Kinetics-400, and UCF101) demonstrate the effectiveness of CAN. Our approach achieves competitive performance, outperforming most mainstream methods, with accuracies of 50.4% on Something-Something V1, 63.9% on Something-Something V2, 88.4% on Diving48, 74.9% on Kinetics-400, and 86.9% on UCF101. These results highlight the importance of capturing multi-scale spatio-temporal cues for robust action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures.

A critical component of disease behavior is the velocity with which disease spreads, defined as the rate of change between time and space. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal modeling approach to determine the velocities of infectious disease spread. Our approach assumes that the locations and times of people infected can be considered as a spatio-temporal point pattern that arises as a realization of a spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox process. The intensity of this process is estimated using fast Bayesian inference by employing the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approaches. The velocity is then calculated using finite differences that approximate the derivatives of the intensity function. Finally, the directions and magnitudes of the velocities can be mapped at specific times to examine better the spread of the disease throughout the region. We demonstrate our method by analyzing COVID-19 spread in Cali, Colombia, during the 2020-2021 pandemic.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 46 figures, Journal American Statistican, submitted on 3rd of September</p></details> |
| **[A Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network for City-Scale Dynamic Logistics Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18441v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>City-scale logistics routing has become increasingly challenging as metropolitan road networks grow to tens of millions of edges and traffic conditions evolve rapidly under high-volume mobility demands. Conventional centralized routing algorithms and monolithic graph neural network (GNN) models suffer from limited scalability, high latency, and poor real-time adaptability, which restricts their effectiveness in large urban logistics systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Distributed Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network (HSTE-GNN) for dynamic routing over ultra-large road networks. The framework partitions the city-scale graph into regional subgraphs processed in parallel across distributed computing nodes, enabling efficient learning of localized traffic dynamics. Within each region, an edge-enhanced spatio-temporal module jointly models node states, dynamic edge attributes, and short-term temporal dependencies. A hierarchical coordination layer further aggregates cross-region representations through an asynchronous parameter-server mechanism, ensuring global routing coherence under high-frequency traffic updates. This distributed hierarchical design balances local responsiveness with global consistency, significantly improving scalability and inference efficiency. Experiments on real-world large-scale traffic datasets from Beijing and New York demonstrate that HSTE-GNN outperforms strong spatio-temporal baselines such as ST-GRAPH, achieving 34.9% lower routing delay, 14.7% lower MAPE, and 11.8% lower RMSE, while improving global route consistency by 7.3%. These results confirm that the proposed framework provides a scalable, adaptive, and efficient solution for next-generation intelligent transportation systems and large-scale logistics platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially-informed transformers: Injecting geostatistical covariance biases into self-attention for spatio-temporal forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17696v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The modeling of high-dimensional spatio-temporal processes presents a fundamental dichotomy between the probabilistic rigor of classical geostatistics and the flexible, high-capacity representations of deep learning. While Gaussian processes offer theoretical consistency and exact uncertainty quantification, their prohibitive computational scaling renders them impractical for massive sensor networks. Conversely, modern transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling but inherently lack a geometric inductive bias, treating spatial sensors as permutation-invariant tokens without a native understanding of distance. In this work, we propose a spatially-informed transformer, a hybrid architecture that injects a geostatistical inductive bias directly into the self-attention mechanism via a learnable covariance kernel. By formally decomposing the attention structure into a stationary physical prior and a non-stationary data-driven residual, we impose a soft topological constraint that favors spatially proximal interactions while retaining the capacity to model complex dynamics. We demonstrate the phenomenon of ``Deep Variography'', where the network successfully recovers the true spatial decay parameters of the underlying process end-to-end via backpropagation. Extensive experiments on synthetic Gaussian random fields and real-world traffic benchmarks confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks. Furthermore, rigorous statistical validation confirms that the proposed method delivers not only superior predictive accuracy but also well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts, effectively bridging the gap between physics-aware modeling and data-driven learning.</p></details> |  |

However, since models must capture both spatial and temporal relationships, performance is limited by the feature representations within a frame but also between multiple frames. We propose the Spatio-Temporal Gaze Network (ST-Gaze), a model that combines a CNN backbone with dedicated channel attention and self-attention modules to fuse eye and face features optimally. The fused features are then treated as a spatial sequence, allowing for the capture of an intra-frame context, which is then propagated through time to model inter-frame dynamics. We evaluated our method on the EVE dataset and show that ST-Gaze achieves state-of-the-art performance both with and without person-specific adaptation. Additionally, our ablation study provides further insights into the model performance, showing that preserving and modelling intra-frame spatial context with our spatio-temporal recurrence is fundamentally superior to premature spatial pooling. As such, our results pave the way towards more robust video-based gaze estimation using commonly available cameras.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, the code repository is available at https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/u0172623/ST-Gaze</p></details> |
| **[Foundation for unbiased cross-validation of spatio-temporal models for species distribution modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03480v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the predictive performance of species distribution models (SDMs) under realistic deployment scenarios requires careful handling of spatial and temporal dependencies in the data. Cross-validation (CV) is the standard approach for model evaluation, but its design strongly influences the validity of performance estimates. When SDMs are intended for spatial or temporal transfer, random CV can lead to overoptimistic results due to spatial autocorrelation (SAC) among neighboring observations. We benchmark four machine learning algorithms (GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest) on two real-world presence-absence datasets, a temperate plant and an anadromous fish, using multiple CV designs: random, spatial, spatio-temporal, environmental, and forward-chaining. Two training data usage strategies (LAST FOLD and RETRAIN) are evaluated, with hyperparameter tuning performed within each CV scheme. Model performance is assessed on independent out-of-time test sets using AUC, MAE, and correlation metrics. Random CV overestimates AUC by up to 0.16 and produces MAE values up to 80 percent higher than spatially blocked alternatives. Blocking at the empirical SAC range substantially reduces this bias. Training strategy affects evaluation outcomes: LAST FOLD yields smaller validation-test discrepancies under strong SAC, while RETRAIN achieves higher test AUC when SAC is weaker. Boosted ensemble models consistently perform best under spatially structured CV designs. We recommend a robust SDM workflow based on SAC-aware blocking, blocked hyperparameter tuning, and external temporal validation to improve reliability under spatial and temporal shifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted manuscript.

| **[Pattern recognition in complex systems via vector-field representations of spatio-temporal data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16763v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A complex system comprises multiple interacting entities whose interdependencies form a unified whole, exhibiting emergent behaviours not present in individual components. Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |
| **[A Survey on Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16487v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many complex real-world systems exhibit inherently intertwined temporal and spatial characteristics. Spatio-temporal knowledge graphs (STKGs) have therefore emerged as a powerful representation paradigm, as they integrate entities, relationships, time and space within a unified graph structure. They are increasingly applied across diverse domains, including environmental systems and urban, transportation, social and human mobility networks. However, modeling STKGs remains challenging: their foundations span classical graph theory as well as temporal and spatial graph models, which have evolved independently across different research communities and follow heterogeneous modeling assumptions and terminologies. As a result, existing approaches often lack conceptual alignment, generalizability and reusability. This survey provides a systematic review of spatio-temporal knowledge graph models, tracing their origins in static, temporal and spatial graph modeling. We analyze existing approaches along key modeling dimensions, including edge semantics, temporal and spatial annotation strategies, temporal and spatial semantics and relate these choices to their respective application domains. Our analysis reveals that unified modeling frameworks are largely absent and that most current models are tailored to specific use cases rather than designed for reuse or long-term knowledge preservation. Based on these findings, we derive modeling guidelines and identify open challenges to guide future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[SNOW: Spatio-Temporal Scene Understanding with World Knowledge for Open-World Embodied Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16461v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robotic systems require spatio-temporal understanding of dynamic environments to ensure reliable navigation and interaction. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide open-world semantic priors, they lack grounding in 3D geometry and temporal dynamics. Conversely, geometric perception captures structure and motion but remains semantically sparse. We propose SNOW (Scene Understanding with Open-World Knowledge), a training-free and backbone-agnostic framework for unified 4D scene understanding that integrates VLM-derived semantics with point cloud geometry and temporal consistency. SNOW processes synchronized RGB images and 3D point clouds, using HDBSCAN clustering to generate object-level proposals that guide SAM2-based segmentation. Each segmented region is encoded through our proposed Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP), producing multimodal tokens that capture localized semantic, geometric, and temporal attributes. These tokens are incrementally integrated into a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG), which serves as 4D prior for downstream reasoning. A lightweight SLAM backend anchors all STEP tokens spatially in the environment, providing the global reference alignment, and ensuring unambiguous spatial grounding across time. The resulting 4DSG forms a queryable, unified world model through which VLMs can directly interpret spatial scene structure and temporal dynamics. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that SNOW enables precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, thereby setting new state-of-the-art performance in several settings, highlighting the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Machine Learning Model for Mortgage Credit Risk: Default Probabilities and Loan Portfolios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02846v3)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel machine learning model for credit risk by combining tree-boosting with a latent spatio-temporal Gaussian process model accounting for frailty correlation. This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |

These multimodal memories enable them to recall past events, infer unobserved states, and integrate new information into context-dependent reasoning. Inspired by this capability, we introduce R4, a training-free framework for retrieval-augmented reasoning in 4D spatio-temporal space that equips vision-language models (VLMs) with structured, lifelong memory. R4 continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time, yielding a persistent world model that can be shared across agents. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations, which are integrated into the VLM's reasoning. Unlike classical retrieval-augmented generation methods, retrieval in R4 operates directly in 4D space, enabling episodic and collaborative reasoning without training. Experiments on embodied question answering and navigation benchmarks demonstrate that R4 substantially improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines, advancing a new paradigm for embodied 4D reasoning in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a new concept of 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP), which aims to address two tasks: (1) reactive forecasting: ''what will happen next'' and (2) proactive forecasting: "what would happen given a specific future action". For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames). To address this task, we propose OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model that maintains a dense voxel-based scene state and incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context over time. OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation. This design enables online inference and robust performance even when historical sensor input is missing or noisy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the OccSTeP concept and our OccSTeP-WM, yielding an average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain).

We introduce a hierarchical architecture that decouples global rigid-body motion from local deformation using two scale-specific networks, denoted as RigidNet and DeformationNet. To enforce kinematic separation between the two components, we adopt a frozen-anchor training strategy combined with a quaternion-incremental scheme. This strategy alleviates the kinematic instability observed in joint training and yields a 29.8% reduction in rigid-body motion error compared with conventional direct prediction schemes. The stable rigid-body anchor improves the resolution of high-frequency structural buckling, which leads to a 17.2% reduction in the total interpolation error. Loss landscape analysis indicates that the decomposition smooths the optimization surface, which enhances robustness to distribution shifts in angular extrapolation and yields a 46.6% reduction in error. To assess physical validity beyond numerical accuracy, we benchmark the decomposed components against an oracle model that represents an upper bound on performance. The proposed framework recovers 92% of the directional correlation between rigid and deformation components and 96% of the spatial deformation localization accuracy relative to the oracle, while tracking the temporal energy dynamics with an 8 ms delay. These results demonstrate that rigid-deformation decomposition enables accurate and physically interpretable predictions for nonlinear collision dynamics.</p></details> | 38 pages, 24 figures |
| **[Question Answering Over Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11542v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal knowledge graphs (STKGs) enhance traditional KGs by integrating temporal and spatial annotations, enabling precise reasoning over questions with spatio-temporal dependencies. Despite their potential, research on spatio-temporal knowledge graph question answering (STKGQA) remains limited. This is primarily due to the lack of datasets that simultaneously contain spatio-temporal information, as well as methods capable of handling implicit spatio-temporal reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce the spatio-temporal question answering dataset (STQAD), the first comprehensive benchmark comprising 10,000 natural language questions that require both temporal and spatial reasoning. STQAD is constructed with real-world facts containing spatio-temporal information, ensuring that the dataset reflects practical scenarios. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that existing KGQA methods underperform on STQAD, primarily due to their inability to model spatio-temporal interactions. To address this, we propose the spatio-temporal complex question answering (STCQA) method, which jointly embeds temporal and spatial features into KG representations and dynamically filters answers through constraint-aware reasoning. STCQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Our work not only provides a valuable resource for future research but also advances the field by offering a robust baseline for answering complex spatio-temporal questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 10 figures.

| **[NL2SpaTiaL: Generating Geometric Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications from Natural Language for Manipulation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13670v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Logic (SpaTiaL) offers a principled formalism for expressing geometric spatial requirements-an essential component of robotic manipulation, where object locations, neighborhood relations, pose constraints, and interactions directly determine task success. Yet prior works have largely relied on standard temporal logic (TL), which models only robot trajectories and overlooks object-level interactions. Existing datasets built from randomly generated TL formulas paired with natural-language descriptions therefore cover temporal operators but fail to represent the layered spatial relations that manipulation tasks depend on. To address this gap, we introduce a dataset generation framework that synthesizes SpaTiaL specifications and converts them into natural-language descriptions through a deterministic, semantics-preserving back-translation procedure. This pipeline produces the NL2SpaTiaL dataset, aligning natural language with multi-level spatial relations and temporal objectives to reflect the compositional structure of manipulation tasks. Building on this foundation, we propose a translation-verification framework equipped with a language-based semantic checker that ensures the generated SpaTiaL formulas faithfully encode the semantics specified by the input description. Experiments across a suite of manipulation tasks show that SpaTiaL-based representations yield more interpretable, verifiable, and compositional grounding for instruction following.

| **[STARCaster: Spatio-Temporal AutoRegressive Video Diffusion for Identity- and View-Aware Talking Portraits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13247v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents STARCaster, an identity-aware spatio-temporal video diffusion model that addresses both speech-driven portrait animation and free-viewpoint talking portrait synthesis, given an identity embedding or reference image, within a unified framework. Existing 2D speech-to-video diffusion models depend heavily on reference guidance, leading to limited motion diversity. At the same time, 3D-aware animation typically relies on inversion through pre-trained tri-plane generators, which often leads to imperfect reconstructions and identity drift. We rethink reference- and geometry-based paradigms in two ways. First, we deviate from strict reference conditioning at pre-training by introducing softer identity constraints. Second, we address 3D awareness implicitly within the 2D video domain by leveraging the inherent multi-view nature of video data. STARCaster adopts a compositional approach progressing from ID-aware motion modeling, to audio-visual synchronization via lip reading-based supervision, and finally to novel view animation through temporal-to-spatial adaptation. To overcome the scarcity of 4D audio-visual data, we propose a decoupled learning approach in which view consistency and temporal coherence are trained independently. A self-forcing training scheme enables the model to learn from longer temporal contexts than those generated at inference, mitigating the overly static animations common in existing autoregressive approaches. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STARCaster generalizes effectively across tasks and identities, consistently surpassing prior approaches in different benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://foivospar.github.io/STARCaster/</p></details> |

While forecasting models generally disregard unmonitored roads by design, spatial imputation methods explicitly address network-wide estimation; yet this approach relies on volume data at inference time, limiting its applicability in sensor-scarce cities. Unlike traffic volume data, probe vehicle speeds and static road attributes are more broadly accessible and support full coverage of road segments in most urban networks. In this work, we present the Hybrid Directed-Attention Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HDA-STGNN), an inductive deep learning framework designed to tackle the network-wide volume estimation problem. Our approach leverages speed profiles, static road attributes, and road network topology to predict daily traffic volume profiles across all road segments in the network. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform extensive ablation studies that demonstrate the model's capacity to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies and highlight the value of topological information for accurate network-wide traffic volume estimation without relying on volume data at inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Hybrid Quantum-Classical Graph Convolutional Neural Network Approach for Urban Taxi Destination Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13745v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Quantum Graph Convolutional Network (H-STQGCN) algorithm by combining the strengths of quantum computing and classical deep learning to predict the taxi destination within urban road networks. Our algorithm consists of two branches: spatial processing and time evolution. Regarding the spatial processing, the classical module encodes the local topological features of the road network based on the GCN method, and the quantum module is designed to map graph features onto parameterized quantum circuits through a differentiable pooling layer. The time evolution is solved by integrating multi-source contextual information and capturing dynamic trip dependencies on the classical TCN theory. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the current methods in terms of prediction accuracy and stability, validating the unique advantages of the quantum-enhanced mechanism in capturing high-dimensional spatial dependencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[L-STEC: Learned Video Compression with Long-term Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12790v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Video Compression has emerged in recent years, with condition-based frameworks outperforming traditional codecs. However, most existing methods rely solely on the previous frame's features to predict temporal context, leading to two critical issues. First, the short reference window misses long-term dependencies and fine texture details. Second, propagating only feature-level information accumulates errors over frames, causing prediction inaccuracies and loss of subtle textures. To address these, we propose the Long-term Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Context (L-STEC) method. We first extend the reference chain with LSTM to capture long-term dependencies. We then incorporate warped spatial context from the pixel domain, fusing spatio-temporal information through a multi-receptive field network to better preserve reference details. Experimental results show that L-STEC significantly improves compression by enriching contextual information, achieving 37.01% bitrate savings in PSNR and 31.65% in MS-SSIM compared to DCVC-TCM, outperforming both VTM-17.0 and DCVC-FM and establishing new state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Data Compression Conference (DCC) 2026 as an oral paper</p></details> |
| **[RAST-MoE-RL: A Regime-Aware Spatio-Temporal MoE Framework for Deep Reinforcement Learning in Ride-Hailing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13727v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ride-hailing platforms face the challenge of balancing passenger waiting times with overall system efficiency under highly uncertain supply-demand conditions. Adaptive delayed matching creates a trade-off between matching and pickup delays by deciding whether to assign drivers immediately or batch requests. Since outcomes accumulate over long horizons with stochastic dynamics, reinforcement learning (RL) is a suitable framework. However, existing approaches often oversimplify traffic dynamics or use shallow encoders that miss complex spatiotemporal patterns. We introduce the Regime-Aware Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (RAST-MoE), which formalizes adaptive delayed matching as a regime-aware MDP equipped with a self-attention MoE encoder. Unlike monolithic networks, our experts specialize automatically, improving representation capacity while maintaining computational efficiency. A physics-informed congestion surrogate preserves realistic density-speed feedback, enabling millions of efficient rollouts, while an adaptive reward scheme guards against pathological strategies. With only 12M parameters, our framework outperforms strong baselines. On real-world Uber trajectory data (San Francisco), it improves total reward by over 13%, reducing average matching and pickup delays by 10% and 15% respectively. It demonstrates robustness across unseen demand regimes and stable training. These findings highlight the potential of MoE-enhanced RL for large-scale decision-making with complex spatiotemporal dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[WGAST: Weakly-Supervised Generative Network for Daily 10 m Land Surface Temperature Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06485v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a weakly-supervised generative network for daily 10 m LST estimation via spatio-temporal fusion of Terra MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity, normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.05% and improves SSIM by 4.22%. Furthermore, WGAST effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against near-surface air temperature measurements from 33 near-ground sensors.

In this article, we introduce the R software package deepspat, which allows for modeling, fitting and prediction with nonstationary spatial and spatio-temporal models applied to Gaussian and extremes data. The nonstationary models in our package are constructed using a deep multi-layered deformation of the original spatial or spatio-temporal domain, and are straightforward to implement. Model parameters are estimated using gradient-based optimization of customized loss functions with tensorflow, which implements automatic differentiation. The functionalities of the package are illustrated through simulation studies and an application to Nepal temperature data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Know-Show: Benchmarking Video-Language Models on Spatio-Temporal Grounded Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05513v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Video-Language Models (Video-LMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal understanding, yet their reasoning remains weakly grounded in space and time. We present Know-Show, a new benchmark designed to evaluate spatio-temporal grounded reasoning, the ability of a model to reason about actions and their semantics while simultaneously grounding its inferences in visual and temporal evidence. Know-Show unifies reasoning and localization within a single evaluation framework consisting of five complementary scenarios across spatial (person, object, person-object, and hand-object) and temporal dimensions. Built from Charades, Action Genome, and Ego4D with 2.5K human-authored questions, the benchmark exposes significant gaps between current Video-LMs and human reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose GRAM, a training-free plug-in that augments Video-LMs with fine-grained grounding through attention-based video token selection and explicit timestamp encoding. Extensive experiments across open and closed Video-LMs (Qwen, VideoLLaVA, GPT-4o, and Gemini, etc.) reveal that existing models struggle to "show what they know" and vice versa, especially in fine-grained hand-object interactions. Know-Show establishes a unified standard for assessing grounded reasoning in video-language understanding and provides insights toward developing interpretable and reliable multimodal reasoning systems. We will release the dataset and the code at https://github.com/LUNAProject22/Know-Show.</p></details> |  |
| **[VOST-SGG: VLM-Aided One-Stage Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05524v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal scene graph generation (ST-SGG) aims to model objects and their evolving relationships across video frames, enabling interpretable representations for downstream reasoning tasks such as video captioning and visual question answering. Despite recent advancements in DETR-style single-stage ST-SGG models, they still suffer from several key limitations. First, while these models rely on attention-based learnable queries as a core component, these learnable queries are semantically uninformed and instance-agnostically initialized. Second, these models rely exclusively on unimodal visual features for predicate classification. To address these challenges, we propose VOST-SGG, a VLM-aided one-stage ST-SGG framework that integrates the common sense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) into the ST-SGG pipeline. First, we introduce the dual-source query initialization strategy that disentangles what to attend to from where to attend, enabling semantically grounded what-where reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal feature bank that fuses visual, textual, and spatial cues derived from VLMs for improved predicate classification. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VLM-aided semantic priors and multi-modal features for ST-SGG. We will release the code at https://github.com/LUNAProject22/VOST.</p></details> |  |
| **[1 + 1 > 2: Detector-Empowered Video Large Language Model for Spatio-Temporal Grounding and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06673v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal grounding and reasoning aims to locate the temporal segment and spatial region of an event in a video given a user query, while also reasoning about semantics such as causality, temporal order, and action relationships. To achieve this, current MLLMs primarily treats bounding boxes as text tokens and generates them autoregressively. However, such autoregressive spatial decoding leads to very-long output sequences, causing spatial errors to accumulated over time and the localization results to progressively drift across a video. To address this, we present a Detector-Empowered Video LLM, short for DEViL, which couples a Video LLM with an open-vocabulary detector (OVD). Specifically, the MLLM and detector are connected via a reference-semantic token (RST) that distills the user query into a rich semantic representation. Unlike tokens that merely serve as spatial prompts or segmentor switches, the RST functions as both a control signal and a replacement for the OVD's text embedding, enabling end-to-end learning of both referential understanding and spatial localization. Furthermore, we propose a tube-mined temporal regularization (TTReg) within OVD, which drives the OVD to generate temporally-consistent queries for target objects, thereby ensuring effective temporal association. Experiments demonstrate that DEViL achieves strong performance across various fine-grained video understanding tasks, particularly STVG and GroundedVQA. Code will be released on https://github.com/gaostar123/DeViL.</p></details> |  |

Although deep learning has advanced automated LVEF estimation, many existing approaches are computationally demanding and underutilize the joint structure of spatial and temporal information in echocardiography videos, limiting their suitability for real-time clinical deployment. We propose Echo-E$^3$Net, an efficient endocardial spatio-temporal network specifically designed for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos. Echo-E$^3$Net comprises two complementary modules: (1) a dual-phase Endocardial Border Detector (E$^2$CBD), which uses phase-specific cross-attention to predict ED/ES endocardial landmarks (EBs) and learn phase-aware landmark embeddings (LEs), and (2) an Endocardial Feature Aggregator (E$^2$FA), which fuses these embeddings with global statistical descriptors (mean, maximum, variance) of deep feature maps to refine EF regression. A multi-component loss function, inspired by Simpson's biplane method, jointly supervises EF, volumes, and landmark geometry, thereby aligning optimization with the clinical definition of LVEF and promoting robust spatio-temporal representation learning. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, Echo-E$^3$Net achieves an RMSE of 5.20 and an $R^2$ score of 0.82, while using only 1.54M parameters and 8.05 GFLOPs. The model operates without external pre-training, heavy data augmentation, or test-time ensembling, making it highly suitable for real-time point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications.

To jointly model these species, we develop a multi-species Log-Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP) in which species specific intensity surfaces are linked through a shared latent spatial Gaussian field. This structure allows the model to capture broad spatial patterns common to both species while still accommodating species level responses to environmental covariates and seasonal variation. The latent field is represented using the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach with an anisotropic Matern covariance, implemented on an ocean constrained triangulated mesh so that spatial dependence aligns with marine geography. Whale group size is incorporated through a marked point process extension with species specific negative binomial marks, allowing occurrence and group sizes to be jointly analyzed within a unified framework. Inference is carried out using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), enabling efficient model fitting over a decade of survey effort. The results highlight persistent multi-species hotspots and distinct environmental associations for each species, demonstrating the value of shared field LGCPs for joint species distribution modeling in data sparse and heterogeneous survey settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Spatio-temporal Extremes via Conditional Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06348v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme weather events are widely studied in fields such as agriculture, ecology, and meteorology. The spatio-temporal co-occurrence of extreme events can strengthen or weaken under changing climate conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model spatio-temporal extremes by integrating climate indices via a conditional variational autoencoder (cXVAE). A convolutional neural network (CNN) is embedded in the decoder to convolve climatological indices with the spatial dependence within the latent space, thereby allowing the decoder to be dependent on the climate variables. There are three main contributions here. First, we demonstrate through extensive simulations that the proposed conditional XVAE accurately emulates spatial fields and recovers spatially and temporally varying extremal dependence with very low computational cost post training. Second, we provide a simple, scalable approach to detecting condition-driven shifts and whether the dependence structure is invariant to the conditioning variable. Third, when dependence is found to be condition-sensitive, the conditional XVAE supports counterfactual experiments allowing intervention on the climate covariate and propagating the associated change through the learned decoder to quantify differences in joint tail risk, co-occurrence ranges, and return metrics. To demonstrate the practical utility and performance of the model in real-world scenarios, we apply our method to analyze the monthly maximum Fire Weather Index (FWI) over eastern Australia from 2014 to 2024 conditioned on the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOAP: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Relation and Motion Information Capturing for Few-Shot Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16344v5)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

Deploying portable sensors on mobile platforms such as cars and buses offers a low-cost, easy-to-maintain, and wide-coverage data collection solution. However, due to the random and uncontrollable movement patterns of these non-dedicated mobile platforms, the resulting sensor data are often incomplete and temporally inconsistent. By exploring potential training patterns in the reverse process of diffusion models, we propose Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (STeP-Diff). STeP-Diff leverages DeepONet to model the spatial sequence of measurements along with a PDE-informed diffusion model to forecast the spatio-temporal field from incomplete and time-varying data. Through a PDE-constrained regularization framework, the denoising process asymptotically converges to the convection-diffusion dynamics, ensuring that predictions are both grounded in real-world measurements and aligned with the fundamental physics governing pollution dispersion. To assess the performance of the system, we deployed 59 self-designed portable sensing devices in two cities, operating for 14 days to collect air pollution data. Compared to the second-best performing algorithm, our model achieved improvements of up to 89.12% in MAE, 82.30% in RMSE, and 25.00% in MAPE, with extensive evaluations demonstrating that STeP-Diff effectively captures the spatio-temporal dependencies in air pollution fields.</p></details> |  |

We propose a decay-adjusted spatio-temporal (DAST) model that explicitly accounts for the time-varying impact of MDA on NTD prevalence, providing a flexible and interpretable framework for estimating intervention effects from sparse survey data. Using case studies on soil-transmitted helminths and lymphatic filariasis, we show that DAST offers a practical alternative to standard geostatistical models when the objective includes quantifying MDA impact and supporting short-term programmatic forecasting. We also discuss extensions and identifiability challenges, advocating for data-driven parsimony over complexity in settings where the available data are too sparse to support the estimation of highly parameterised models.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[ToG-Bench: Task-Oriented Spatio-Temporal Grounding in Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03666v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core capability towards general embodied intelligence lies in localizing task-relevant objects from an egocentric perspective, formulated as Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG). Despite recent progress, existing STVG studies remain largely confined to object-centric and descriptive instructions, neglecting the task-oriented reasoning that is crucial for embodied agents to accomplish goal-directed interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{ToG-Bench}, the first task-oriented spatio-temporal video grounding benchmark for egocentric videos. ToG-Bench is characterized by three key features: (1) \textbf{Task-oriented Grounding}, which requires identifying and localizing objects based on intended tasks rather than straightforward descriptions; (2) \textbf{Explicit-Implicit Dual Grounding}, where target objects can be either explicitly mentioned or implicitly inferred by contextual reasoning; (3) \textbf{One-to-Many Grounding}, where a single instruction may correspond to multiple objects involved in task execution. Built upon videos sourced from ScanNet, ToG-Bench comprises 100 annotated clips with 2,704 task-oriented grounding instructions, constructed via a semi-automated pipeline that combines foundation model annotation and human refinement. In addition, we introduce a set of task-level evaluation metrics tailored for multi-object and explicit-implicit object grounding, and systematically benchmark seven state-of-the-art MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal the intrinsic challenges of task-oriented STVG and substantial performance gaps across explicit-implicit and multi-object grounding, highlighting the difficulty of bridging perception and interaction in embodied scenarios.

Therefore, it is imperative to develop a robust spatio-temporal learning methodology capable of extracting meaningful insights from incomplete datasets. Despite the existence of methodologies for spatio-temporal graph forecasting in the presence of missing values, unresolved issues persist. Primarily, the majority of extant research is predicated on time-series analysis, thereby neglecting the dynamic spatial correlations inherent in sensor networks. Additionally, the complexity of missing data patterns compounds the intricacy of the problem. Furthermore, the variability in maintenance conditions results in a significant fluctuation in the ratio and pattern of missing values, thereby challenging the generalizability of predictive models. In response to these challenges, this study introduces GeoMAE, a self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning model. The model is comprised of three principal components: an input preprocessing module, an attention-based spatio-temporal forecasting network (STAFN), and an auxiliary learning task, which draws inspiration from Masking AutoEncoders to enhance the robustness of spatio-temporal representation learning. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that GeoMAE significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, achieving up to 13.20\% relative improvement over the best baseline models.</p></details> | 34 pages |

Conservation professionals urgently need timely, high-resolution predictions of biodiversity risks, especially in ecologically diverse regions like Africa. We propose EcoCast, a spatio-temporal model designed for continual biodiversity and climate risk forecasting. Utilizing multisource satellite imagery, climate data, and citizen science occurrence records, EcoCast predicts near-term (monthly to seasonal) shifts in species distributions through sequence-based transformers that model spatio-temporal environmental dependencies. The architecture is designed with support for continual learning to enable future operational deployment with new data streams. Our pilot study in Africa shows promising improvements in forecasting distributions of selected bird species compared to a Random Forest baseline, highlighting EcoCast's potential to inform targeted conservation policies. By demonstrating an end-to-end pipeline from multi-modal data ingestion to operational forecasting, EcoCast bridges the gap between cutting-edge machine learning and biodiversity management, ultimately guiding data-driven strategies for climate resilience and ecosystem conservation throughout Africa.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 1 table.

| **[Beyond Scaffold: A Unified Spatio-Temporal Gradient Tracking Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01732v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In distributed and federated learning algorithms, communication overhead is often reduced by performing multiple local updates between communication rounds. However, due to data heterogeneity across nodes and the local gradient noise within each node, this strategy can lead to the drift of local models away from the global optimum. To address this issue, we revisit the well-known federated learning method Scaffold (Karimireddy et al., 2020) under a gradient tracking perspective, and propose a unified spatio-temporal gradient tracking algorithm, termed ST-GT, for distributed stochastic optimization over time-varying graphs. ST-GT tracks the global gradient across neighboring nodes to mitigate data heterogeneity, while maintaining a running average of local gradients to substantially suppress noise, with slightly more storage overhead. Without assuming bounded data heterogeneity, we prove that ST-GT attains a linear convergence rate for strongly convex problems and a sublinear rate for nonconvex cases. Notably, ST-GT achieves the first linear speed-up in communication complexity with respect to the number of local updates per round $τ$ for the strongly-convex setting. Compared to traditional gradient tracking methods, ST-GT reduces the topology-dependent noise term from $σ^2$ to $σ^2/τ$, where $σ^2$ denotes the noise level, thereby improving communication efficiency.</p></details> | 13 pages |

However, the standard approach of repeatedly sampling trajectories from scratch is computationally expensive. While recent methods have attempted to mitigate costs using specialized value agents, they can suffer from model miscalibration and fail to generalize to modern agents that synthesize custom bash scripts as tools. In this paper, we introduce SWE-Replay, the first efficient and generalizable test-time scaling technique for modern agents without reliance on potentially noisy value estimates. SWE-Replay optimizes the scaling process by recycling trajectories from prior trials, dynamically choosing to either explore from scratch or exploit archived experience by branching at critical intermediate steps. This selection of intermediate steps is driven by the potential and reasoning significance of repository exploration, rather than external LLM-based quality estimates. Our evaluation shows that, on SWE-Bench Verified, SWE-Replay consistently outperforms naive scaling, reducing costs by up to 17.4% while maintaining or even improving performance by up to 3.8%. Further evaluation on SWE-Bench Pro and Multilingual validates the generalizability of SWE-Replay, establishing it as a robust foundation for efficient test-time scaling of software engineering agents.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing approaches that rely on event generation models or contrast maximization, EROAM employs a spherical event representation by projecting events onto a unit sphere and introduces Event Spherical Iterative Closest Point (ES-ICP), a novel geometric optimization framework designed specifically for event camera data. The spherical representation simplifies rotational motion formulation while operating in a continuous spherical domain, enabling enhanced spatial resolution. Our system features an efficient map management approach using incremental k-d tree structures and intelligent regional density control, ensuring optimal computational performance during long-term operation. Combined with parallel point-to-line optimization, EROAM achieves efficient computation without compromising accuracy. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that EROAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Our method maintains consistent performance under challenging conditions, including high angular velocities and extended sequences, where other methods often fail or show significant drift. Additionally, EROAM produces high-quality panoramic reconstructions with preserved fine structural details.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2026.

| **[Exploring Diverse Generation Paths via Inference-time Stiefel Activation Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22010v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models often default to a narrow set of high-probability outputs, leaving their generation paths homogeneous and prone to mode collapse. Sampling-based strategies inject randomness but still struggle to guarantee diversity across multiple concurrent generation runs. We address this limitation by introducing STARS ($\textbf{St}$iefel-based $\textbf{A}$ctivation Steering for Diverse $\textbf{R}$ea$\textbf{S}$oning), a training-free, inference-time intervention method that transforms activation steering into an exploration engine. At each token, STARS collects the hidden activations of concurrent generation runs and optimizes multiple additive steering directions jointly on the Stiefel manifold. STARS maximizes the geometric volume of the steered activations, while the Stiefel manifold induces orthogonality of the steering interventions. This formulation explicitly promotes divergent activation vectors of concurrent generation runs, and implicitly promotes divergent generation trajectories. This manifold optimization formulation can be solved using a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm with convergence guarantees, but this algorithm is too time-consuming for real-time inference. To guarantee low latency, we further design a lightweight one-step update with an aggressive, closed-form stepsize. For test case generation and scientific discovery benchmarks, STARS consistently outperforms standard sampling methods, achieving greater diversity without sacrificing qualitative performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 2 figures.

| **[MoHETS: Long-term Time Series Forecasting with Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21866v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world multivariate time series can exhibit intricate multi-scale structures, including global trends, local periodicities, and non-stationary regimes, which makes long-horizon forecasting challenging. Although sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches improve scalability and specialization, they typically rely on homogeneous MLP experts that poorly capture the diverse temporal dynamics of time series data. We address these limitations with MoHETS, an encoder-only Transformer that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts (MoHE) layers. MoHE routes temporal patches to a small subset of expert networks, combining a shared depthwise-convolution expert for sequence-level continuity with routed Fourier-based experts for patch-level periodic structures. MoHETS further improves robustness to non-stationary dynamics by incorporating exogenous information via cross-attention over covariate patch embeddings. Finally, we replace parameter-heavy linear projection heads with a lightweight convolutional patch decoder, improving parameter efficiency, reducing training instability, and allowing a single model to generalize across arbitrary forecast horizons. We validate across seven multivariate benchmarks and multiple horizons, with MoHETS consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, reducing the average MSE by $12\%$ compared to strong recent baselines, demonstrating effective heterogeneous specialization for long-term forecasting.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Test-Time Compute Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21839v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time compute has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, this strategy has in turn increased how much users pay cloud-based providers offering LLM-as-a-service, since providers charge users for the amount of test-time compute they use to generate an output. In our work, we show that the market of LLM-as-a-service is socially inefficient: providers have a financial incentive to increase the amount of test-time compute, even if this increase contributes little to the quality of the outputs. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a reverse second-price auction mechanism where providers bid their offered price and (expected) quality for the opportunity to serve a user, and users pay proportionally to the marginal value generated by the winning provider relative to the second-highest bidder. To illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with multiple instruct models from the $\texttt{Llama}$ and $\texttt{Qwen}$ families, as well as reasoning models distilled from $\texttt{DeepSeek-R1}$, on math and science benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Decomposable Forward Process in Diffusion Models for Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21812v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a model-agnostic forward diffusion process for time-series forecasting that decomposes signals into spectral components, preserving structured temporal patterns such as seasonality more effectively than standard diffusion. Unlike prior work that modifies the network architecture or diffuses directly in the frequency domain, our proposed method alters only the diffusion process itself, making it compatible with existing diffusion backbones (e.g., DiffWave, TimeGrad, CSDI). By staging noise injection according to component energy, it maintains high signal-to-noise ratios for dominant frequencies throughout the diffusion trajectory, thereby improving the recoverability of long-term patterns. This strategy enables the model to maintain the signal structure for a longer period in the forward process, leading to improved forecast quality. Across standard forecasting benchmarks, we show that applying spectral decomposition strategies, such as the Fourier or Wavelet transform, consistently improves upon diffusion models using the baseline forward process, with negligible computational overhead.

| **[Distribution-Aware Reward Estimation for Test-Time Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21804v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) enables large language models (LLMs) to self-improve on unlabeled inputs, but its effectiveness critically depends on how reward signals are estimated without ground-truth supervision. Most existing TTRL methods rely on majority voting (MV) over rollouts to produce deterministic rewards, implicitly assuming that the majority rollout provides a reliable learning signal. We show that this assumption is fragile: MV reduces the rollout distribution into a single outcome, discarding information about non-majority but correct actions candidates, and yields systematically biased reward estimates. To address this, we propose Distribution-AwareReward Estimation (DARE), which shifts reward estimation from a single majority outcome to the full empirical rollout distribution. DARE further augments this distribution-based reward with an exploration bonus and a distribution pruning mechanism for non-majority rollout exploration and reward denoise, yielding a more informative and robust reward estimation. Extensive experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that DARE improves optimization stability and final performance over recent baselines, achieving relative improvements of 25.3% on challenging AIME 2024 and 5.3% on AMC.</p></details> |  |

We achieve this by using a sliding time window with short strides and consider the temporal dimension by storing convolution results between passes. This allows us to ignore unchanged regions, significantly reducing the number of convolution operations per forward pass without sacrificing accuracy. This data reuse scheme introduces extreme sparsity to detection data. To exploit this sparsity, we extend our previous work on scatter-based convolutions to allow for data reuse, and as such propose Sparse Scatter-Based Convolution Algorithm with Temporal Data Recycling (SSCATeR). This operation treats incoming LiDAR data as a continuous stream and acts only on the changing parts of the point cloud. By doing so, we achieve the same results with as much as a 6.61-fold reduction in processing time. Our test results show that the feature maps output by our method are identical to those produced by traditional sparse convolution techniques, whilst greatly increasing the computational efficiency of the network.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages, 27 Figures, This work has been accepted for publication by the IEEE Sensors Journal.

Among the key contributors is excessive optical flow-perceived visual motion that, when unmatched by vestibular input, leads to sensory conflict and discomfort. While previous efforts have explored geometric or hardware based mitigation strategies, such methods often rely on predefined scene structures, manual tuning, or intrusive equipment. In this work, we propose U-MAD, a lightweight, real-time, AI-based solution that suppresses perceptually disruptive optical flow directly at the image level. Unlike prior handcrafted approaches, this method learns to attenuate high-intensity motion patterns from rendered frames without requiring mesh-level editing or scene specific adaptation. Designed as a plug and play module, U-MAD integrates seamlessly into existing VR pipelines and generalizes well to procedurally generated environments. The experiments show that U-MAD consistently reduces average optical flow and enhances temporal stability across diverse scenes. A user study further confirms that reducing visual motion leads to improved perceptual comfort and alleviated cybersickness symptoms. These findings demonstrate that perceptually guided modulation of optical flow provides an effective and scalable approach to creating more user-friendly immersive experiences. The code will be released at https://github.com/XXXXX (upon publication).</p></details> |  |

Existing robustness strategies either prune data or rely on costly prior quantification, failing to balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce DropoutTS, a model-agnostic plugin that shifts the paradigm from "what" to learn to "how much" to learn. DropoutTS employs a Sample-Adaptive Dropout mechanism: leveraging spectral sparsity to efficiently quantify instance-level noise via reconstruction residuals, it dynamically calibrates model learning capacity by mapping noise to adaptive dropout rates - selectively suppressing spurious fluctuations while preserving fine-grained fidelity. Extensive experiments across diverse noise regimes and open benchmarks show DropoutTS consistently boosts superior backbones' performance, delivering advanced robustness with negligible parameter overhead and no architectural modifications. Our code is available at https://github.com/CityMind-Lab/DropoutTS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Not Waste Your Rollouts: Recycling Search Experience for Efficient Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21684v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Time Scaling enhances the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models by allocating additional inference compute to broaden the exploration of the solution space. However, existing search strategies typically treat rollouts as disposable samples, where valuable intermediate insights are effectively discarded after each trial. This systemic memorylessness leads to massive computational redundancy, as models repeatedly re-derive discovered conclusions and revisit known dead ends across extensive attempts. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Recycling Search Experience (RSE)}, a self-guided, training-free strategy that turns test-time search from a series of isolated trials into a cumulative process. By actively distilling raw trajectories into a shared experience bank, RSE enables positive recycling of intermediate conclusions to shortcut redundant derivations and negative recycling of failure patterns to prune encountered dead ends. Theoretically, we provide an analysis that formalizes the efficiency gains of RSE, validating its advantage over independent sampling in solving complex reasoning tasks. Empirically, extensive experiments on HMMT24, HMMT25, IMO-Bench, and HLE show that RSE consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost, achieving state-of-the-art scaling efficiency.</p></details> | preprint |

However, slow inference speeds and prevalent non-autoregressive paradigms severely constrain the application of diffusion-based THG models. In this study, we propose REST, a pioneering diffusion-based, real-time, end-to-end streaming audio-driven talking head generation framework. To support real-time end-to-end generation, a compact video latent space is first learned through a spatiotemporal variational autoencoder with a high compression ratio. Additionally, to enable semi-autoregressive streaming within the compact video latent space, we introduce an ID-Context Cache mechanism, which integrates ID-Sink and Context-Cache principles into key-value caching for maintaining identity consistency and temporal coherence during long-term streaming generation. Furthermore, an Asynchronous Streaming Distillation (ASD) strategy is proposed to mitigate error accumulation and enhance temporal consistency in streaming generation, leveraging a non-streaming teacher with an asynchronous noise schedule to supervise the streaming student. REST bridges the gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches, achieving a breakthrough in efficiency for applications requiring real-time THG. Experimental results demonstrate that REST outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generation speed and overall performance.</p></details> | 27 pages, 10 figures |

While automated machine learning pipelines are starting to recognize and integrate data preprocessing into their solutions for classification and regression tasks, this integration is lacking for more specialized tasks like survival or time-to-event models. As a result, survival analysis not only faces the general challenges of data preprocessing but also suffers from the lack of tailored, automated solutions in this area. To address this gap, this paper presents 'CleanSurvival', a reinforcement-learning-based solution for optimizing preprocessing pipelines, extended specifically for survival analysis. The framework can handle continuous and categorical variables, using Q-learning to select which combination of data imputation, outlier detection and feature extraction techniques achieves optimal performance for a Cox, random forest, neural network or user-supplied time-to-event model. The package is available on GitHub: https://github.com/datasciapps/CleanSurvival Experimental benchmarks on real-world datasets show that the Q-learning-based data preprocessing results in superior predictive performance to standard approaches, finding such a model up to 10 times faster than undirected random grid search. Furthermore, a simulation study demonstrates the effectiveness in different types and levels of missingness and noise in the data.</p></details> |  |
| **[ILRR: Inference-Time Steering Method for Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21647v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive alternative for text generation, yet effective mechanisms for inference-time control remain relatively underexplored. Existing approaches include sampling-level guidance procedures or trajectory optimization mechanisms. In this work, we introduce Iterative Latent Representation Refinement (ILRR), a learning-free framework for steering DLMs using a single reference sequence. ILRR guides generation by dynamically aligning the internal activations of the generated sequence with those of a given reference throughout the denoising process. This approach captures and transfers high-level semantic properties, with a tunable steering scale enabling flexible control over attributes such as sentiment. We further introduce Spatially Modulated Steering, an extension that enables steering long texts using shorter references by regulating guidance intensity across the sequence. Empirically, we demonstrate that ILRR achieves effective attribute steering on LLaDA and MDLM architectures with a minor computational overhead, requiring only one additional parallel forward pass per denoising step. Under the same compute budget, ILRR improves attribute accuracy over comparable baselines by 10$\%$ to 60$\%$ points, while maintaining high generation quality.</p></details> |  |

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are a proven solution to scaling problems in natural language processing. However, existing MoE approaches for time-series forecasting rely on token-wise routing mechanisms, which may fail to exploit the natural locality and continuity of temporal data. In this work, we introduce Seg-MoE, a sparse MoE design that routes and processes contiguous time-step segments rather than making independent expert decisions. Token segments allow each expert to model intra-segment interactions directly, naturally aligning with inherent temporal patterns. We integrate Seg-MoE layers into a time-series Transformer and evaluate it on multiple multivariate long-term forecasting benchmarks. Seg-MoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across almost all prediction horizons, outperforming both dense Transformers and prior token-wise MoE models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm that segment-level routing is the key factor driving these gains. Our results show that aligning the MoE routing granularity with the inherent structure of time series provides a powerful, yet previously underexplored, inductive bias, opening new avenues for conditionally sparse architectures in sequential data modeling.</p></details> | Under review |

While test-time training (TTT) offers a promising solution, existing Parameter Finetuning (PaFT) paradigm suffer from catastrophic forgetting, hindering their real-world applicability. We propose TTReFT, a novel Test-Time Representation FineTuning framework that transitions the adaptation target from model parameters to latent representations. Specifically, TTReFT achieves this through three key innovations: (1) uncertainty-guided node selection for specific interventions, (2) low-rank representation interventions that preserve pre-trained knowledge, and (3) an intervention-aware masked autoencoder that dynamically adjust masking strategy to accommodate the node selection scheme. Theoretically, we establish guarantees for TTReFT in OOD settings. Empirically, extensive experiments across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that TTReFT achieves consistent and superior performance. Our work establishes representation finetuning as a new paradigm for graph TTT, offering both theoretical grounding and immediate practical utility for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches relying on manual sampling or expensive commercial systems fail to address accessibility challenges in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents HydroSense, an innovative Internet of Things framework that integrates six critical water quality parameters including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), estimated nitrogen, and water level into a unified monitoring system. HydroSense employs a novel dual-microcontroller architecture, utilizing Arduino Uno for precision analog measurements with five-point calibration algorithms and ESP32 for wireless connectivity, edge processing, and cloud integration. The system implements advanced signal processing techniques including median filtering for TDS measurement, temperature compensation algorithms, and robust error handling. Experimental validation over 90 days demonstrates exceptional performance metrics: pH accuracy of plus or minus 0.08 units across the 0 to 14 range, DO measurement stability within plus or minus 0.2 mg/L, TDS accuracy of plus or minus 1.9 percent across 0 to 1000 ppm, and 99.8 percent cloud data transmission reliability. With a total implementation cost of 32,983 BDT (approximately 300 USD), HydroSense achieves an 85 percent cost reduction compared to commercial systems while providing enhanced connectivity through the Firebase real-time database. This research establishes a new paradigm for accessible environmental monitoring, demonstrating that professional-grade water quality assessment can be achieved through intelligent system architecture and cost-effective component selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entropy Guided Dynamic Patch Segmentation for Time Series Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26157v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Patch-based transformers have emerged as efficient and improved long-horizon modeling architectures for time series modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens representation learning. We propose a novel Entropy-Guided Dynamic Patch Encoder (EntroPE), as a temporally informed framework that dynamically detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations. Extensive experiments on long-term forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection demonstrate that the proposed method improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series modeling.

Recent multi-modal forecasting methods leverage textual information such as news reports to improve prediction, but most rely on token-level fusion that mixes temporal patches with language tokens in a shared embedding space. However, such fusion can be ill-suited when high-quality time-text pairs are scarce and when time series exhibit substantial variation in scale and characteristics, thus complicating cross-modal alignment. In parallel, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have proven effective for both time series modeling and multi-modal learning, yet many existing MoE-based modality integration methods still depend on token-level fusion. To address this, we propose Expert Modulation, a new paradigm for multi-modal time series prediction that conditions both routing and expert computation on textual signals, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal control over expert behavior. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and experiments, our proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-modal time series prediction.

Classical geometric approaches such as SLAM offer reliable localization but depend on detailed maps and cannot interpret human-targeted cues (e.g., signs, room numbers) essential for indoor reasoning. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models introduce semantic grounding but remain strictly reactive, basing decisions only on visible frames and failing to anticipate unseen intersections or reason about distant textual cues. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide richer contextual inference but suffer from high computational latency, making them unsuitable for real-time operation on embedded platforms. In this work, we present IROS, a real-time navigation framework that combines VLM-level contextual reasoning with the efficiency of lightweight perceptual modules on low-cost, on-device hardware. Inspired by Dual Process Theory, IROS separates fast reflexive decisions (System One) from slow deliberative reasoning (System Two), invoking the VLM only when necessary. Furthermore, by augmenting compact VLMs with spatial and textual cues, IROS delivers robust, human-like navigation with minimal latency. Across five real-world buildings, IROS improves decision accuracy and reduces latency by 66% compared to continuous VLM-based navigation.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a training-free inference method to sample directly from the optimal RL policy. The transition probability applied to Masked Language Modeling (MLM) consists of a reference policy model and an energy term. Based on this, our algorithm, Energy-Guided Test-Time Scaling (ETS), estimates the key energy term via online Monte Carlo, with a provable convergence rate. Moreover, to ensure practical efficiency, ETS leverages modern acceleration frameworks alongside tailored importance sampling estimators, substantially reducing inference latency while provably preserving sampling quality. Experiments on MLM (including autoregressive models and diffusion language models) across reasoning, coding, and science benchmarks show that our ETS consistently improves generation quality, validating its effectiveness and design.</p></details> |  |

This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size. Our approach is likely applicable to other cardiovascular scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We studied participants who watched a short robbery video (approximating a one-time eyewitness scenario) and composed recall statements using either a default GPT or a guided GPT prompted with a standardized eyewitness protocol. Results show that, in the default condition, participants who believed they had a clearer understanding of the event were more likely to trust GPT's output, whereas in the guided condition, participants showed stronger alignment between subjective clarity and actual recall. Additionally, participants evaluated the legitimacy of the individuals in the incident differently across conditions. Interaction analysis further revealed that default-GPT users spontaneously developed diverse strategies, including building on existing recollections, requesting potentially missing details, and treating GPT as a recall coach. This work shows how GPT-user interplay can subconsciously shape beliefs and perceptions of remembered events.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures, CHI 2026</p></details> |

Recent attempts hybridize numerical time series with their visualized plots, facilitating precise value reasoning and visual structure comprehension for comprehensive time series understanding of MLLMs. However, effective cross-modal integration remains challenging due to fine-grained temporal misalignment across modalities and severe entanglement between shared and modality-specific semantics, which hinder localized interpretation and complementary reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MADI, a multi-modal LLM enhanced with fine-grained alignment and disentangled interaction, featuring (1) Patch-level Alignment, which enforces physically grounded fine-grained correspondence across heterogeneous modalities, (2) Discrete Disentangled Interaction, which separates modality-common semantics into compact discrete latents and adaptively synergizes the purified modality-unique information, and (3) Critical-token Highlighting, which emphasizes informative, query-relevant signals for robust reasoning. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that MADI consistently outperforms general-purpose LLMs and time-series-specialized MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Real-Time Gas Crossover Prediction in PEM Electrolyzers: First Application with Multi-Membrane Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05879v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Green hydrogen production via polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is pivotal for energy transition, yet hydrogen crossover through membranes threatens safety and economic viability-approaching explosive limits (4 mol% H$_2$ in O$_2$) while reducing Faradaic efficiency and accelerating membrane degradation. Current physics-based models require extensive calibration and computational resources that preclude real-time implementation, while purely data-driven approaches fail to extrapolate beyond training conditions-critical for dynamic electrolyzer operation. Here we present the first application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for hydrogen crossover prediction, trained on 184 published measurements augmented to 1,114 points and constrained by a constitutive physics model (Henry's law, Fick's diffusion, and Faraday-based gas production) embedded in the loss function. Our compact architecture (17,793 parameters), validated across six membranes under industrially relevant conditions (0.05-5.0 A/cm$^2$, 1-200 bar, 25-85°C), achieves exceptional accuracy (R$^2$ = 99.84% $\pm$ 0.15%, RMSE = 0.0932% $\pm$ 0.0438%) based on five-fold cross-validation, with sub-millisecond inference enabling real-time control. Remarkably, the model maintains R$^2$ > 86% when predicting crossover at pressures 2.5x beyond training range-substantially outperforming pure neural networks (R$^2$ = 43.4%). The hardware-agnostic deployment, from desktop CPUs to edge devices (Raspberry Pi 4), enables distributed safety monitoring essential for gigawatt-scale installations. By bridging physical rigor and computational efficiency, this work establishes a new paradigm for real-time electrolyzer monitoring, accelerating deployment of safe, efficient green hydrogen infrastructure crucial for net-zero emissions targets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Test-Time Adaptation through Latent Subspace Coefficients Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11068v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world deployment often exposes models to distribution shifts, making test-time adaptation (TTA) critical for robustness. Yet most TTA methods are unfriendly to edge deployment, as they rely on backpropagation, activation buffering, or test-time mini-batches, leading to high latency and memory overhead. We propose $\textbf{ELaTTA}$ ($\textit{Efficient Latent Test-Time Adaptation}$), a gradient-free framework for single-instance TTA under strict on-device constraints. ELaTTA freezes model weights and adapts each test sample by optimizing a low-dimensional coefficient vector in a source-induced principal latent subspace, pre-computed offline via truncated SVD and stored with negligible overhead. At inference, ELaTTA encourages prediction confidence by optimizing the $k$-D coefficients with CMA-ES, effectively optimizing a Gaussian-smoothed objective and improving stability near decision boundaries. Across six benchmarks and multiple architectures, ELaTTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy under both strict and continual single-instance protocols, while reducing compute by up to $\textit{63$\times$}$ and peak memory by $\textit{11$\times$}$. We further demonstrate on-device deployment on a ZYNQ-7020 platform. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | Under review |

However, existing works do not effectively consider the impact of extraneous variables on the prediction of the target variable. On the other hand, they fail to fully extract complex sequence information based on various time patterns of the sequences. To address these drawbacks, we propose a DA-SPS model, which adopts different modules for feature extraction based on the information characteristics of different variables. DA-SPS mainly consists of two stages: the target variable processing stage (TVPS) and the extraneous variables processing stage (EVPS). In TVPS, the model first uses Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to process the target variable sequence and then uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and P-Conv-LSTM which deploys a patching strategy to extract features from trend and seasonality components, respectively. In EVPS, the model filters extraneous variables that have a strong correlation with the target variate by using Spearman correlation analysis and further analyses them using the L-Attention module which consists of LSTM and attention mechanism. Finally, the results obtained by TVPS and EVPS are combined through weighted summation and linear mapping to produce the final prediction. The results on four public datasets demonstrate that the DA-SPS model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, its performance in real-world scenarios is further validated using a private dataset collected by ourselves, which contains the test items' information on laptop motherboards.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence</p></details> |

While post-hoc explainable methods based on gradients and feature-based attributions have been popular, they suffer from reference state sensitivity and struggle to generalize across time-series datasets, as they treat time points independently and ignore sequential dependencies. Another perspective on explainable time-series classification is through interpretable components of the model, for instance, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to estimate temporal attribution; however, recent findings indicate that these attention weights often fail to provide faithful measures of temporal importance. In this work, we advance this perspective and present a novel explainability-driven deep learning framework, TimeSliver, which jointly utilizes raw time-series data and its symbolic abstraction to construct a representation that maintains the original temporal structure. Each element in this representation linearly encodes the contribution of each temporal segment to the final prediction, allowing us to assign a meaningful importance score to every time point. For time-series classification, TimeSliver outperforms other temporal attribution methods by 11% on 7 distinct synthetic and real-world multivariate time-series datasets. TimeSliver also achieves predictive performance within 2% of state-of-the-art baselines across 26 UEA benchmark datasets, positioning it as a strong and explainable framework for general time-series classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, its signals are high dimensional and noisy, hindering interpretation. We investigate compact representations of spatiotemporal articulatory dynamics for phoneme recognition from midsagittal vocal tract rtMRI videos. We compare three feature types: (1) raw video, (2) optical flow, and (3) six linguistically-relevant regions of interest (ROIs) for articulator movements. We evaluate models trained independently on each representation, as well as multi-feature combinations. Results show that multi-feature models consistently outperform single-feature baselines, with the lowest phoneme error rate (PER) of 0.34 obtained by combining ROI and raw video. Temporal fidelity experiments demonstrate a reliance on fine-grained articulatory dynamics, while ROI ablation studies reveal strong contributions from tongue and lips. Our findings highlight how rtMRI-derived features provide accuracy and interpretability, and establish strategies for leveraging articulatory data in speech processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOMEMTO: Patch-based Memory Gate Model in Time Series Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18751v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently reconstruction-based deep models have been widely used for time series anomaly detection, but as their capacity and generalization capability increase, these models tend to over-generalize, often reconstructing unseen anomalies accurately. Prior works have attempted to mitigate this by incorporating a memory architecture that stores prototypes of normal patterns. Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from high training costs and have yet to be effectively integrated with time series foundation models (TFMs). To address these challenges, we propose MOMEMTO, an improved variant of TFM for anomaly detection, enhanced with a patch-based memory module to mitigate over-generalization. The memory module is designed to capture representative normal patterns from multiple domains and enables a single model to be jointly fine-tuned across multiple datasets through a multi-domain training strategy. MOMEMTO initializes memory items with latent representations from a pre-trained encoder, organizes them into patch-level units, and updates them via an attention mechanism. We evaluate our method using 23 univariate benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MOMEMTO, as a single model, achieves higher scores on AUC and VUS metrics compared to baseline methods, and further enhances the performance of its backbone TFM, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictability-Aware Compression and Decompression Framework for Multichannel Time Series Data with Latent Seasonality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00614v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world multichannel time series prediction faces growing demands for efficiency across edge and cloud environments, making channel compression a timely and essential problem. Motivated by the success of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) methods in signal processing, we propose a predictability-aware compression-decompression framework to reduce runtime, decrease communication cost, and maintain prediction accuracy across diverse predictors. The core idea involves using a circular seasonal key matrix with orthogonality to capture underlying time series predictability during compression and to mitigate reconstruction errors during decompression by introducing more realistic data assumptions. Theoretical analyses show that the proposed framework is both time-efficient and accuracy-preserving under a large number of channels. Extensive experiments on six datasets across various predictors demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior overall performance by jointly considering prediction accuracy and runtime, while maintaining strong compatibility with diverse predictors.</p></details> | 17 pages,3 figures |
| **[Less Diverse, Less Safe: The Indirect But Pervasive Risk of Test-Time Scaling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08592v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning by exploring multiple candidate responses and then operating over this set to find the best output. A tacit premise behind TTS is that sufficiently diverse candidate pools enhance reliability. In this work, we show that this assumption in TTS introduces a previously unrecognized failure mode. When candidate diversity is curtailed, even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv) that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through extensive experiments across open-source models (e.g. Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1, Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited protection against this diversity-driven failure mode.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Models for Time Series Anomaly Detection in Aerospace Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12448v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of aerospace software systems. Although large language models (LLMs) provide a promising training-free alternative to unsupervised approaches, their effectiveness in aerospace settings remains under-examined because of complex telemetry, misaligned evaluation metrics, and the absence of domain knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce ATSADBench, the first benchmark for aerospace TSAD. ATSADBench comprises nine tasks that combine three pattern-wise anomaly types, univariate and multivariate signals, and both in-loop and out-of-loop feedback scenarios, yielding 108,000 data points. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under two paradigms: Direct, which labels anomalies within sliding windows, and Prediction-Based, which detects anomalies from prediction errors. To reflect operational needs, we reformulate evaluation at the window level and propose three user-oriented metrics: Alarm Accuracy (AA), Alarm Latency (AL), and Alarm Contiguity (AC), which quantify alarm correctness, timeliness, and credibility. We further examine two enhancement strategies, few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), to inject domain knowledge. The evaluation results show that (1) LLMs perform well on univariate tasks but struggle with multivariate telemetry, (2) their AA and AC on multivariate tasks approach random guessing, (3) few-shot learning provides modest gains whereas RAG offers no significant improvement, and (4) in practice LLMs can detect true anomaly onsets yet sometimes raise false alarms, which few-shot prompting mitigates but RAG exacerbates. These findings offer guidance for future LLM-based TSAD in aerospace software.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ASE 2025</p></details> |

This paper presents maxwait, a simple coordination mechanism with surprising generality that makes these tradeoffs explicit and configurable. We demonstrate that this mechanism subsumes classical distributed system methods such as PTIDES, Chandy-and-Misra with or without null messages, Jefferson's Time-Warp, and Lamport's time-based fault detection, while enabling real-time behavior in distributed cyber-physical applications. The mechanism can also realize many commonly used distributed system patterns, including logical execution time (LET), publish and subscribe, actors, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and remote procedure calls with futures. More importantly, it adds to these mechanisms better control over timing, bounded time fault detection, and the option of making them more deterministic, all within a single semantic framework. Implemented as an extension of the Lingua Franca coordination language, maxwait enforces logical-time consistency when communication latencies are bounded and provides structured fault handling when bounds are violated.</p></details> |  |

While normalization is well-studied in dataset-specific time-series models, it remains overlooked in TSFMs where generalization is critical. Time-series data, unlike text or images, exhibits significant scale variation across domains and channels, coupled with non-stationarity, can undermine TSFM performance regardless of architectural complexity. Through systematic evaluation across four architecturally diverse TSFMs, we empirically establish REVIN as the most efficient approach, reducing zero-shot MASE by 89\% relative to an un-normalized baseline and by 44\% versus other normalization methods, while matching the best in-domain accuracy (0.84 MASE) without any dataset-level preprocessing -- yielding the highest accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Yet its effect utilization depends on architectural design choices and optimization objective, particularly with respect to training loss scale sensitivity and model type (probabilistic, point-forecast, or LLM-based models).</p></details> |  |
| **[SMKC: Sketch Based Kernel Correlation Images for Variable Cardinality Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21050v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional anomaly detection in multivariate time series relies on the assumption that the set of observed variables remains static. In operational environments, however, monitoring systems frequently experience sensor churn. Signals may appear, disappear, or be renamed, creating data windows where the cardinality varies and may include values unseen during training. To address this challenge, we propose SMKC, a framework that decouples the dynamic input structure from the anomaly detector. We first employ permutation-invariant feature hashing to sketch raw inputs into a fixed size state sequence. We then construct a hybrid kernel image to capture global temporal structure through pairwise comparisons of the sequence and its derivatives. The model learns normal patterns using masked reconstruction and a teacher-student prediction objective. Our evaluation reveals that robust log-distance channels provide the primary discriminative signal, whereas cosine representations often fail to capture sufficient contrast. Notably, we find that a detector using random projections and nearest neighbors on the SMKC representation performs competitively with fully trained baselines without requiring gradient updates. This highlights the effectiveness of the representation itself and offers a practical cold-start solution for resource-constrained deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Adaptation for Unsupervised Combinatorial Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21048v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) enables learning powerful solvers without access to ground-truth solutions. Existing approaches fall into two disjoint paradigms: models trained for generalization across instances, and instance-specific models optimized independently at test time. While the former are efficient during inference, they lack effective instance-wise adaptability; the latter are flexible but fail to exploit learned inductive structure and are prone to poor local optima. This motivates the central question of our work: how can we leverage the inductive bias learned through generalization while unlocking the flexibility required for effective instance-wise adaptation? We first identify a challenge in bridging these two paradigms: generalization-focused models often constitute poor warm starts for instance-wise optimization, potentially underperforming even randomly initialized models when fine-tuned at test time. To resolve this incompatibility, we propose TACO, a model-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that unifies and extends the two existing paradigms for unsupervised NCO. TACO applies strategic warm-starting to partially relax trained parameters while preserving inductive bias, enabling rapid and effective unsupervised adaptation. Crucially, compared to naively fine-tuning a trained generalizable model or optimizing an instance-specific model from scratch, TACO achieves better solution quality while incurring negligible additional computational cost. Experiments on canonical CO problems, Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TACO across static, distribution-shifted, and dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, establishing it as a practical bridge between generalizable and instance-specific unsupervised NCO.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we formulate visual reasoning by means of video generation models, positing that generated frames can act as intermediate reasoning steps between initial states and solutions. We evaluate their capacity in two distinct regimes: Maze Navigation for sequential discrete planning with low visual change and Tangram Puzzle for continuous manipulation with high visual change. Our experiments reveal three critical insights: (1) Robust Zero-Shot Generalization: In both tasks, the model demonstrates strong performance on unseen data distributions without specific finetuning. (2) Visual Context: The model effectively uses visual context as explicit control, such as agent icons and tangram shapes, enabling it to maintain high visual consistency and adapt its planning capability robustly to unseen patterns. (3) Visual Test-Time Scaling: We observe a test-time scaling law in sequential planning; increasing the generated video length (visual inference budget) empowers better zero-shot generalization to spatially and temporally complex paths. These findings suggest that video generation is not merely a media tool, but a scalable, generalizable paradigm for visual reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables (26 pages, 13 figures, 6 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |

However, existing methods typically treat these streams as independent samples, overlooking the supervisory signal inherent in temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (OATTA). We formulate test-time adaptation as a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation task, using a learned dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior to refine the base model's predictions. To ensure safety in weakly structured streams, we introduce a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) that reverts to the base predictor when temporal evidence is absent. OATTA is a lightweight, model-agnostic module that incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments across image classification, wearable and physiological signal analysis, and language sentiment analysis demonstrate its universality; OATTA consistently boosts established baselines, improving accuracy by up to 6.35%. Our findings establish that modeling temporal dynamics provides a critical, orthogonal signal beyond standard order-agnostic TTA approaches.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

PatchFormer segments time series into patches and learns multiscale temporal representations with learnable aggregation across temporal scales. Pretraining uses masked patch reconstruction with dynamic masking and objectives that encourage both local accuracy and global consistency, followed by cross-domain knowledge distillation. Experiments on 24 benchmark datasets spanning weather, energy, traffic, finance, and healthcare demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot multi-horizon forecasting, reducing mean squared error by 27.3 percent relative to strong baselines while requiring 94 percent less task-specific training data.

Classical model selection methods, such as information criteria and cross-validation, rely heavily on the stationarity assumption and often fail in dynamic environments which undergo gradual or abrupt changes over time. Yet real-world data are rarely stationary, and model selection under nonstationarity remains a largely open problem. To tackle this challenge, we combine conformal inference with model confidence sets to develop a procedure that adaptively selects models best suited to the evolving dynamics at any given time. Concretely, the MPS updates in real time a confidence set of candidate models that covers the best model for the next time period with a specified long-run probability, while adapting to nonstationarity of unknown forms. Through simulations and real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that MPS reliably and efficiently identifies optimal models under nonstationarity, an essential capability lacking in offline methods. Moreover, MPS frequently produces high-quality sets with small cardinality, whose evolution offers deeper insights into changing dynamics. As a generic framework, MPS accommodates any data-generating process, data structure, model class, training method, and evaluation metric, making it broadly applicable across diverse problem settings.</p></details> |  |

We introduce EVEREST, a transformer-based architecture for probabilistic rare-event forecasting that delivers calibrated predictions and tail-aware risk estimation, with auxiliary interpretability via attention-based signal attribution. EVEREST integrates four components: (i) a learnable attention bottleneck for soft aggregation of temporal dynamics; (ii) an evidential head for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty via a Normal--Inverse--Gamma distribution; (iii) an extreme-value head that models tail risk using a Generalized Pareto Distribution; and (iv) a lightweight precursor head for early-event detection. These modules are jointly optimized with a composite loss (focal loss, evidential NLL, and a tail-sensitive EVT penalty) and act only at training time; deployment uses a single classification head with no inference overhead (approximately 0.81M parameters). On a decade of space-weather data, EVEREST achieves state-of-the-art True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.973/0.970/0.966 at 24/48/72-hour horizons for C-class flares. The model is compact, efficient to train on commodity hardware, and applicable to high-stakes domains such as industrial monitoring, weather, and satellite diagnostics. Limitations include reliance on fixed-length inputs and exclusion of image-based modalities, motivating future extensions to streaming and multimodal forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated author affiliation.

We investigate the replacement of HDBSCAN (offline clustering) with online (streaming/incremental) clustering methods in a production narrative report generation pipeline. The proposed system employs a three-stage architecture (data collection, modeling, dashboard generation) that processes thousands of multilingual social media documents daily. While HDBSCAN excels at discovering hierarchical density-based clusters and handling noise, its batch-only nature necessitates complete retraining for each time window, resulting in memory constraints, computational inefficiency, and inability to adapt to evolving narratives in real-time. This work evaluates a bunch of online clustering algorithms across dimensions of cluster quality preservation, computational efficiency, memory footprint, and integration compatibility with existing workflows. We propose evaluation criteria that balance traditional clustering metrics (Silhouette Coefficient, Davies-Bouldin Index) with narrative metrics (narrative distinctness, contingency and variance). Our methodology includes sliding-window simulations on historical datasets from Ukraine information space, enabling comparative analysis of algorithmic trade-offs in realistic operational contexts.

Existing approaches predominantly rely on parameter updates or experience replay, which inevitably suffer from knowledge overwriting or privacy risks. To address this, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP), a privacy-preserving framework that maintains a dynamic pool of specialized forecasters. Instead of storing raw samples, CEP utilizes lightweight statistical genes to decouple concept identification from forecasting. Specifically, it employs a Retrieval mechanism to identify the nearest concept based on gene similarity, an Evolution strategy to spawn new forecasters upon detecting distribution shifts, and an Elimination policy to prune obsolete models under memory constraints. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CEP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing forecasting error by over 20% without accessing historical ground truth.</p></details> |  |

Although recent research has highlighted the efficiency of linear architectures in capturing global trends, these models often struggle with non-linear signals. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic receptive field analysis of convolutional neural network (CNN) TSF models. We introduce the "individual receptive field" to uncover granular structural dependencies, revealing that convolutional layers act as feature extractors that mirror channel-wise attention while exhibiting superior robustness to non-linear fluctuations. Based on these insights, we propose ACFormer, an architecture designed to reconcile the efficiency of linear projections with the non-linear feature-extraction power of convolutions. ACFormer captures fine-grained information through a shared compression module, preserves temporal locality via gated attention, and reconstructs variable-specific temporal patterns using an independent patch expansion layer. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACFormer consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively mitigating the inherent drawbacks of linear models in capturing high-frequency components.</p></details> |  |
| **[Byte Pair Encoding for Efficient Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14411v3)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing time series tokenization methods predominantly encode a constant number of samples into individual tokens. This inflexible approach can generate excessive tokens for even simple patterns like extended constant values, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Inspired by the success of byte pair encoding, we propose the first pattern-centric tokenization scheme for time series analysis. Based on a discrete vocabulary of frequent motifs, our method merges samples with underlying patterns into tokens, compressing time series adaptively. Exploiting our finite set of motifs and the continuous properties of time series, we further introduce conditional decoding as a lightweight yet powerful post-hoc optimization method, which requires no gradient computation and adds no computational overhead. On recent time series foundation models, our motif-based tokenization improves forecasting performance by 36% and boosts efficiency by 1990% on average. Conditional decoding further reduces MSE by up to 44%. In an extensive analysis, we demonstrate the adaptiveness of our tokenization to diverse temporal patterns, its generalization to unseen data, and its meaningful token representations capturing distinct time series properties, including statistical moments and trends.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages in total, 22 figures</p></details> |

This paper presents a framework for achieving autonomous excavation using reinforcement learning (RL) through a rock excavation simulator. In the simulation, resolution can be defined by the particle size/number in the whole soil space. Fine-resolution simulations closely mimic real-world behavior but demand significant calculation time and challenging sample collection, while coarse-resolution simulations enable faster sample collection but deviate from real-world behavior. To combine the advantages of both resolutions, we explore using policies developed in coarse-resolution simulations for pre-training in fine-resolution simulations. To this end, we propose a novel policy learning framework called Progressive-Resolution Policy Distillation (PRPD), which progressively transfers policies through some middle-resolution simulations with conservative policy transfer to avoid domain gaps that could lead to policy transfer failure. Validation in a rock excavation simulator and nine real-world rock environments demonstrated that PRPD reduced sampling time to less than 1/7 while maintaining task success rates comparable to those achieved through policy learning in a fine-resolution simulation. Additional videos and supplementary results are available on our project page: https://yuki-kadokawa.github.io/prpd/</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering (T-ASE)</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we propose DiffVC-RT, the first framework designed to achieve real-time diffusion-based perceptual NVC. First, we introduce an Efficient and Informative Model Architecture. Through strategic module replacements and pruning, this architecture significantly reduces computational complexity while mitigating structural information loss. Second, to address generative flickering artifacts, we propose Explicit and Implicit Consistency Modeling. We enhance temporal consistency by explicitly incorporating a zero-cost Online Temporal Shift Module within the U-Net, complemented by hybrid implicit consistency constraints. Finally, we present an Asynchronous and Parallel Decoding Pipeline incorporating Mixed Half Precision, which enables asynchronous latent decoding and parallel frame reconstruction via a Batch-dimension Temporal Shift design. Experiments show that DiffVC-RT achieves 80.1% bitrate savings in terms of LPIPS over VTM-17.0 on HEVC dataset with real-time encoding and decoding speeds of 206 / 30 fps for 720p videos on an NVIDIA H800 GPU, marking a significant milestone in diffusion-based video compression.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

Accordingly, inflation risks are distributional and cannot be fully captured by mean-based models. We propose a flexible time-varying parameter distributional regression model that estimates the full conditional distribution of inflation, allowing macroeconomic drivers to have nonlinear and asymmetric effects across the distribution. Applied to U.S. inflation, the model captures major shifts in tail-risk probabilities. Analysis of risk drivers shows that deflationary pressures arise primarily from demand-side weakness and inflation persistence, whereas upside risks are driven mainly by supply-side shocks, particularly energy price inflation. Examining the impact of key drivers further reveals that the unemployment-inflation relationship weakens in the distributional tails. Energy price shocks, by contrast, have little effect on deflation risk but exhibit strongly time-varying and asymmetric effects on high-inflation risk.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness hinges on an implicit assumption of local stationarity assumption, making them prone to errors in long-term forecasting of highly non-stationary series, especially when abrupt fluctuations occur, a common challenge in domains like web traffic monitoring. To overcome this limitation, we propose TimeCatcher, a novel Volatility-Aware Variational Forecasting framework. TimeCatcher extends linear architectures with a variational encoder to capture latent dynamic patterns hidden in historical data and a volatility-aware enhancement mechanism to detect and amplify significant local variations. Experiments on nine real-world datasets from traffic, financial, energy, and weather domains show that TimeCatcher consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with particularly large improvements in long-term forecasting scenarios characterized by high volatility and sudden fluctuations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ColaPrinceCHEN/TimeCatcher.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. 13 pages, 8 figures.

This paper introduces AWGformer, a novel architecture that integrates adaptive wavelet decomposition with cross-scale attention mechanisms for enhanced multi-variate time series prediction. Our approach comprises: (1) an Adaptive Wavelet Decomposition Module (AWDM) that dynamically selects optimal wavelet bases and decomposition levels based on signal characteristics; (2) a Cross-Scale Feature Fusion (CSFF) mechanism that captures interactions between different frequency bands through learnable coupling matrices; (3) a Frequency-Aware Multi-Head Attention (FAMA) module that weights attention heads according to their frequency selectivity; (4) a Hierarchical Prediction Network (HPN) that generates forecasts at multiple resolutions before reconstruction. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AWGformer achieves significant average improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with particular effectiveness on multi-scale and non-stationary time series. Theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees and establishes the connection between our wavelet-guided attention and classical signal processing principles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

Contemporary learning techniques primarily focus on structured learning paths, knowledge tracing, and generic adaptive testing but fail to address real-time learning challenges driven by cognitive load, attention fluctuations, and engagement levels. Building on findings from a formative user study (N=66), we introduce GuideAI, a multi-modal framework that enhances LLM-driven learning by integrating real-time biosensory feedback including eye gaze tracking, heart rate variability, posture detection, and digital note-taking behavior. GuideAI dynamically adapts learning content and pacing through cognitive optimizations (adjusting complexity based on learning progress markers), physiological interventions (breathing guidance and posture correction), and attention-aware strategies (redirecting focus using gaze analysis). Additionally, GuideAI supports diverse learning modalities, including text-based, image-based, audio-based, and video-based instruction, across varied knowledge domains. A preliminary study (N = 25) assessed GuideAI's impact on knowledge retention and cognitive load through standardized assessments. The results show statistically significant improvements in both problem-solving capability and recall-based knowledge assessments. Participants also experienced notable reductions in key NASA-TLX measures including mental demand, frustration levels, and effort, while simultaneously reporting enhanced perceived performance. These findings demonstrate GuideAI's potential to bridge the gap between current LLM-based learning systems and individualized learner needs, paving the way for adaptive, cognition-aware education at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 31st International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI 2026)</p></details> |

This paper introduces ScatterFusion, a novel framework that synergistically integrates scattering transforms with hierarchical attention mechanisms for robust time series forecasting. Our approach comprises four key components: (1) a Hierarchical Scattering Transform Module (HSTM) that extracts multi-scale invariant features capturing both local and global patterns; (2) a Scale-Adaptive Feature Enhancement (SAFE) module that dynamically adjusts feature importance across different scales; (3) a Multi-Resolution Temporal Attention (MRTA) mechanism that learns dependencies at varying time horizons; and (4) a Trend-Seasonal-Residual (TSR) decomposition-guided structure-aware loss function. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that ScatterFusion outperforms other common methods, achieving significant reductions in error metrics across various prediction horizons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Policy of Thoughts: Scaling LLM Reasoning via Test-time Policy Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20379v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) struggle with complex, long-horizon reasoning due to instability caused by their frozen policy assumption. Current test-time scaling methods treat execution feedback merely as an external signal for filtering or rewriting trajectories, without internalizing it to improve the underlying reasoning strategy. Inspired by Popper's epistemology of "conjectures and refutations," we argue that intelligence requires real-time evolution of the model's policy through learning from failed attempts. We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process. PoT first generates diverse candidate solutions via an efficient exploration mechanism, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update a transient LoRA adapter based on execution feedback. This closed-loop design enables dynamic, instance-specific refinement of the model's reasoning priors. Experiments show that PoT dramatically boosts performance: a 4B model achieves 49.71% accuracy on LiveCodeBench, outperforming GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 despite being over 50 smaller.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional approaches maintain these systems as independent silos, creating operational inefficiencies, delayed emergency responses, and increased management complexity. This paper presents a comprehensive dual-modality Internet of Things framework that seamlessly integrates RFID-based access control with multi-sensor environmental safety monitoring through a unified cloud architecture. The system comprises two coordinated subsystems: Subsystem 1 implements RFID authentication with servo-actuated gate control and real-time Google Sheets logging, while Subsystem 2 provides comprehensive safety monitoring incorporating flame detection, water flow measurement, LCD status display, and personnel identification. Both subsystems utilize ESP32 microcontrollers for edge processing and wireless connectivity. Experimental evaluation over 45 days demonstrates exceptional performance metrics: 99.2\% RFID authentication accuracy with 0.82-second average response time, 98.5\% flame detection reliability within 5-meter range, and 99.8\% cloud data logging success rate. The system maintains operational integrity during network disruptions through intelligent local caching mechanisms and achieves total implementation cost of 5,400 BDT (approximately \$48), representing an 82\% reduction compared to commercial integrated solutions. This research establishes a practical framework for synergistic security-safety integration, demonstrating that professional-grade performance can be achieved through careful architectural design and component optimization while maintaining exceptional cost-effectiveness and accessibility for diverse application scenarios.</p></details> |  |

A Study on Sudoku](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20363v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can standard continuous-time generative models represent distributions whose support is an extremely sparse, globally constrained discrete set? We study this question using completed Sudoku grids as a controlled testbed, treating them as a subset of a continuous relaxation space. We train flow-matching and score-based models along a Gaussian probability path and compare deterministic (ODE) sampling, stochastic (SDE) sampling, and DDPM-style discretizations derived from the same continuous-time training. Unconditionally, stochastic sampling substantially outperforms deterministic flows; score-based samplers are the most reliable among continuous-time methods, and DDPM-style ancestral sampling achieves the highest validity overall. We further show that the same models can be repurposed for guided generation: by repeatedly sampling completions under clamped clues and stopping when constraints are satisfied, the model acts as a probabilistic Sudoku solver. Although far less sample-efficient than classical solvers and discrete-geometry-aware diffusion methods, these experiments demonstrate that classic diffusion/flow formulations can assign non-zero probability mass to globally constrained combinatorial structures and can be used for constraint satisfaction via stochastic search.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 5 figures.

However, standard space--time PINNs take time as an input but reuse a single network with shared weights across all times, forcing the same features to represent markedly different dynamics. This coupling degrades accuracy and can destabilize training when enforcing PDE, boundary, and initial constraints jointly. We propose Time-Induced Neural Networks (TINNs), a novel architecture that parameterizes the network weights as a learned function of time, allowing the effective spatial representation to evolve over time while maintaining shared structure. The resulting formulation naturally yields a nonlinear least-squares problem, which we optimize efficiently using a Levenberg--Marquardt method. Experiments on various time-dependent PDEs show up to $4\times$ improved accuracy and $10\times$ faster convergence compared to PINNs and strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, SD remains largely unexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which extend LLMs to process both image and text prompts. To address this gap, we benchmark existing inference methods with small draft models on 11 datasets across diverse input scenarios and observe scenario-specific performance fluctuations. Motivated by these findings, we propose Test-time Adaptive Batched Ensemble Drafting (TABED), which dynamically ensembles multiple drafts obtained via batch inference by leveraging deviations from past ground truths available in the SD setting. The dynamic ensemble method achieves an average robust walltime speedup of 1.74x over autoregressive decoding and a 5% improvement over single drafting methods, while remaining training-free and keeping ensembling costs negligible through parameter sharing. With its plug-and-play compatibility, we further enhance TABED by integrating advanced verification and alternative drafting methods.

Unlike thresholdbased binarisation, which produces brittle masks under distribution shift, TDA allows anomalies to be characterised as disruptions to global structure rather than local fluctuations. We introduce TopoOT, a topology-aware optimal transport (OT) framework that integrates multi-filtration persistence diagrams (PDs) with test-time adaptation (TTA). Our key innovation is Optimal Transport Chaining, which sequentially aligns PDs across thresholds and filtrations, yielding geodesic stability scores that identify features consistently preserved across scales. These stabilityaware pseudo-labels supervise a lightweight head trained online with OT-consistency and contrastive objectives, ensuring robust adaptation under domain shift. Across standard 2D and 3D anomaly detection benchmarks, TopoOT achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the most competitive methods by up to +24.1% mean F1 on 2D datasets and +10.2% on 3D AS benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Existing LLM-based reasoning methods prioritize contextual over structural relations, struggling to extract relevant subgraphs from dynamic graphs. This limits structural information understanding, leading to unstructured, hallucination-prone inferences especially with temporal inconsistencies. To address this problem, we propose IGETR (Integration of Graph and Editing-enhanced Temporal Reasoning), a hybrid reasoning framework that combines the structured temporal modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the contextual understanding of LLMs. IGETR operates through a three-stage pipeline. The first stage aims to ground the reasoning process in the actual data by identifying structurally and temporally coherent candidate paths through a temporal GNN, ensuring that inference starts from reliable graph-based evidence. The second stage introduces LLM-guided path editing to address logical and semantic inconsistencies, leveraging external knowledge to refine and enhance the initial paths. The final stage focuses on integrating the refined reasoning paths to produce predictions that are both accurate and interpretable. Experiments on standard TKG benchmarks show that IGETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines with relative improvements of up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on the challenging ICEWS datasets. Additionally, we execute ablation studies and additional analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> |  |

We achieve this by using a sliding time window with short strides and consider the temporal dimension by storing convolution results between passes. This allows us to ignore unchanged regions, significantly reducing the number of convolution operations per forward pass without sacrificing accuracy. This data reuse scheme introduces extreme sparsity to detection data. To exploit this sparsity, we extend our previous work on scatter-based convolutions to allow for data reuse, and as such propose Sparse Scatter-Based Convolution Algorithm with Temporal Data Recycling (SSCATeR). This operation treats incoming LiDAR data as a continuous stream and acts only on the changing parts of the point cloud. By doing so, we achieve the same results with as much as a 6.61-fold reduction in processing time. Our test results show that the feature maps output by our method are identical to those produced by traditional sparse convolution techniques, whilst greatly increasing the computational efficiency of the network.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages, 27 Figures, This work has been accepted for publication by the IEEE Sensors Journal.

| **[Temporal Sepsis Modeling: a Fully Interpretable Relational Way](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21747v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sepsis remains one of the most complex and heterogeneous syndromes in intensive care, characterized by diverse physiological trajectories and variable responses to treatment. While deep learning models perform well in the early prediction of sepsis, they often lack interpretability and ignore latent patient sub-phenotypes. In this work, we propose a machine learning framework by opening up a new avenue for addressing this issue: a relational approach. Temporal data from electronic medical records (EMRs) are viewed as multivariate patient logs and represented in a relational data schema. Then, a propositionalisation technique (based on classic aggregation/selection functions from the field of relational data) is applied to construct interpretable features to "flatten" the data. Finally, the flattened data is classified using a selective naive Bayesian classifier. Experimental validation demonstrates the relevance of the suggested approach as well as its extreme interpretability. The interpretation is fourfold: univariate, global, local, and counterfactual.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Guidance for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21744v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Decoding (CD) enhances the generation quality of large language models (LLMs) but incurs significant additional computational overhead due to the need for an auxiliary model. Existing internal self-contrastive decoding methods, such as Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), focus on discrepancies across different layers, which are notably unstable on small-scale models. In this work, based on the observation that LLMs exhibit local preferences, we propose a novel contrastive guidance strategy along the temporal dimension, namely Temporal Guidance (TeGu). Our method ingeniously leverages Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) to construct weaker amateur predictions for model self-contrast. To standardize the implementation of this mechanism, we further introduce a lightweight Conditional MTP Projector (cMTPP), which avoids maintaining multiple independent networks as required by other MTP modules. Across various model series and benchmarks, TeGu achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining low additional memory consumption and computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Attention Patterns Exist: A Unifying Temporal Perspective Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21709v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention patterns play a crucial role in both training and inference of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have identified individual patterns such as retrieval heads, sink heads, and diagonal traces, yet these observations remain fragmented and lack a unifying explanation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Temporal Attention Pattern Predictability Analysis (TAPPA), a unifying framework that explains diverse attention patterns by analyzing their underlying mathematical formulations} from a temporally continuous perspective. TAPPA both deepens the understanding of attention behavior and guides inference acceleration approaches. Specifically, TAPPA characterizes attention patterns as predictable patterns with clear regularities and unpredictable patterns that appear effectively random. Our analysis further reveals that this distinction can be explained by the degree of query self-similarity along the temporal dimension. Focusing on the predictable patterns, we further provide a detailed mathematical analysis of three representative cases through the joint effect of queries, keys, and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We validate TAPPA by applying its insights to KV cache compression and LLM pruning tasks. Across these tasks, a simple metric motivated by TAPPA consistently improves performance over baseline methods.

| **[Mining Forgery Traces from Reconstruction Error: A Weakly Supervised Framework for Multimodal Deepfake Temporal Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21458v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern deepfakes have evolved into localized and intermittent manipulations that require fine-grained temporal localization. The prohibitive cost of frame-level annotation makes weakly supervised methods a practical necessity, which rely only on video-level labels. To this end, we propose Reconstruction-based Temporal Deepfake Localization (RT-DeepLoc), a weakly supervised temporal forgery localization framework that identifies forgeries via reconstruction errors. Our framework uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained exclusively on authentic data to learn its intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns; this allows the model to produce significant reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments, effectively providing the missing fine-grained cues for localization. To robustly leverage these indicators, we introduce a novel Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss (AICL). By focusing on the compactness of authentic features guided by these reconstruction cues, AICL establishes a stable decision boundary that enhances local discrimination while preserving generalization to unseen forgeries. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including LAV-DF, demonstrate that RT-DeepLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[MPF-Net: Exposing High-Fidelity AI-Generated Video Forgeries via Hierarchical Manifold Deviation and Micro-Temporal Fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21408v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Veo and Wan, the visual quality of synthetic content has reached a level where macro-level semantic errors and temporal inconsistencies are no longer prominent. However, this does not imply that the distinction between real and cutting-edge high-fidelity fake is untraceable. We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter. By analyzing the structured MPF that persists even in visually perfect sequences, our framework ensures that forgeries are exposed regardless of whether they manifest as global real-world manifold deviations or subtle computational fingerprints.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiHateLoc: Towards Temporal Localisation of Multimodal Hate Content in Online Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10408v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of video content on platforms such as TikTok and YouTube has intensified the spread of multimodal hate speech, where harmful cues emerge subtly and asynchronously across visual, acoustic, and textual streams. Existing research primarily focuses on video-level classification, leaving the practically crucial task of temporal localisation, identifying when hateful segments occur, largely unaddressed. This challenge is even more noticeable under weak supervision, where only video-level labels are available, and static fusion or classification-based architectures struggle to capture cross-modal and temporal dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose MultiHateLoc, the first framework designed for weakly-supervised multimodal hate localisation. MultiHateLoc incorporates (1) modality-aware temporal encoders to model heterogeneous sequential patterns, including a tailored text-based preprocessing module for feature enhancement; (2) dynamic cross-modal fusion to adaptively emphasise the most informative modality at each moment and a cross-modal contrastive alignment strategy to enhance multimodal feature consistency; (3) a modality-aware MIL objective to identify discriminative segments under video-level supervision. Despite relying solely on coarse labels, MultiHateLoc produces fine-grained, interpretable frame-level predictions. Experiments on HateMM and MultiHateClip show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the localisation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2026 (WWW 2026)</p></details> |
| **[MMGRid: Navigating Temporal-aware and Cross-domain Generative Recommendation via Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15930v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging (MM) offers an efficient mechanism for integrating multiple specialized models without access to original training data or costly retraining. While MM has demonstrated success in domains like computer vision, its role in recommender systems (RSs) remains largely unexplored. Recently, Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in RSs, characterized by rapidly growing model scales and substantial computational costs, making MM particularly appealing for cost-sensitive deployment scenarios. In this work, we present the first systematic study of MM in GR through a contextual lens. We focus on a fundamental yet underexplored challenge in real-world: how to merge generative recommenders specialized to different real-world contexts, arising from temporal evolving user behaviors and heterogeneous application domains. To this end, we propose a unified framework MMGRid, a structured contextual grid of GR checkpoints that organizes models trained under diverse contexts induced by temporal evolution and domain diversity. All checkpoints are derived from a shared base LLM but fine-tuned on context-specific data, forming a realistic and controlled model space for systematically analyzing MM across GR paradigms and merging algorithms. Our investigation reveals several key insights. First, training GR models from LLMs can introduce parameter conflicts during merging due to token distribution shifts and objective disparities; such conflicts can be alleviated by disentangling task-aware and context-specific parameter changes via base model replacement. Second, incremental training across contexts induces recency bias, which can be effectively balanced through weighted contextual merging. Notably, we observe that optimal merging weights correlate with context-dependent interaction characteristics, offering practical guidance for weight selection in real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Joinn99/MMGRid</p></details> |

However, its signals are high dimensional and noisy, hindering interpretation. We investigate compact representations of spatiotemporal articulatory dynamics for phoneme recognition from midsagittal vocal tract rtMRI videos. We compare three feature types: (1) raw video, (2) optical flow, and (3) six linguistically-relevant regions of interest (ROIs) for articulator movements. We evaluate models trained independently on each representation, as well as multi-feature combinations. Results show that multi-feature models consistently outperform single-feature baselines, with the lowest phoneme error rate (PER) of 0.34 obtained by combining ROI and raw video. Temporal fidelity experiments demonstrate a reliance on fine-grained articulatory dynamics, while ROI ablation studies reveal strong contributions from tongue and lips. Our findings highlight how rtMRI-derived features provide accuracy and interpretability, and establish strategies for leveraging articulatory data in speech processing.</p></details> |  |

Using the HBN movie-watching dataset, we benchmark five architectures, CNN, LSTM, a stabilized Transformer (EEGXF), S4, and S5, on a 4-class task across segment lengths from 8s to 128s. Accuracy improves with longer context: at 64s, S5 reaches 98.7%+/-0.6 and CNN 98.3%+/-0.3, while S5 uses ~20x fewer parameters than CNN. To probe real-world robustness, we evaluate zero-shot cross-frequency shifts, cross-task OOD inputs, and leave-one-subject-out generalization. S5 achieves stronger cross-subject accuracy but makes over-confident errors on OOD tasks; EEGXF is more conservative and stable under frequency shifts, though less calibrated in-distribution. These results reveal a practical efficiency-robustness trade-off: S5 for parameter-efficient peak accuracy; EEGXF when robustness and conservative uncertainty are critical.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-Assisted Engineering Should Track the Epistemic Status and Temporal Validity of Architectural Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21116v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This position paper argues that AI-assisted software engineering requires explicit mechanisms for tracking the epistemic status and temporal validity of architectural decisions. LLM coding assistants generate decisions faster than teams can validate them, yet no widely-adopted framework distinguishes conjecture from verified knowledge, prevents trust inflation through conservative aggregation, or detects when evidence expires. We propose three requirements for responsible AI-assisted engineering: (1) epistemic layers that separate unverified hypotheses from empirically validated claims, (2) conservative assurance aggregation grounded in the Gödel t-norm that prevents weak evidence from inflating confidence, and (3) automated evidence decay tracking that surfaces stale assumptions before they cause failures. We formalize these requirements as the First Principles Framework (FPF), ground its aggregation semantics in fuzzy logic, and define a quintet of invariants that any valid aggregation operator must satisfy. Our retrospective audit applying FPF criteria to two internal projects found that 20-25% of architectural decisions had stale evidence within two months, validating the need for temporal accountability. We outline research directions including learnable aggregation operators, federated evidence sharing, and SMT-based claim validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 13 tables.

| **[Towards Mitigating Modality Bias in Vision-Language Models for Temporal Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21078v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Action Localization (TAL) requires identifying both the boundaries and categories of actions in untrimmed videos. While vision-language models (VLMs) offer rich semantics to complement visual evidence, existing approaches tend to overemphasize linguistic priors at the expense of visual performance, leading to a pronounced modality bias. We propose ActionVLM, a vision-language aggregation framework that systematically mitigates modality bias in TAL. Our key insight is to preserve vision as the dominant signal while adaptively exploiting language only when beneficial. To this end, we introduce (i) a debiasing reweighting module that estimates the language advantage-the incremental benefit of language over vision-only predictions-and dynamically reweights language modality accordingly, and (ii) a residual aggregation strategy that treats language as a complementary refinement rather than the primary driver. This combination alleviates modality bias, reduces overconfidence from linguistic priors, and strengthens temporal reasoning. Experiments on THUMOS14 show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art by up to 3.2% mAP.</p></details> |  |
| **[STEMS: Spatial-Temporal Mapping For Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03287v3)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising bio-inspired third-generation neural networks. Recent research has trained deep SNN models with accuracy on par with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Although the event-driven and sparse nature of SNNs show potential for more energy efficient computation than ANNs, SNN neurons have internal states which evolve over time. Keeping track of SNN states can significantly increase data movement and storage requirements, potentially losing its advantages with respect to ANNs. This paper investigates the energy effects of having neuron states, and how it is influenced by the chosen mapping to realistic hardware architectures with advanced memory hierarchies. Therefore, we develop STEMS, a mapping design space exploration for SNNs. STEMS models SNN's stateful behavior and explores intra-layer and inter-layer mapping optimizations to minimize data movement, considering both spatial and temporal SNN dimensions. Using STEMS, we show up to 12x reduction in off-chip data movement and 5x reduction in energy (on top of intra-layer optimizations), on two event-based vision SNN benchmarks. Finally, neuron states may not be needed for all SNN layers. By optimizing neuron states for one of our benchmarks, we show 20x reduction in neuron states and 1.4x better performance without accuracy loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 23 figures, under review at IEEE TC</p></details> |

However, existing methods typically treat these streams as independent samples, overlooking the supervisory signal inherent in temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (OATTA). We formulate test-time adaptation as a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation task, using a learned dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior to refine the base model's predictions. To ensure safety in weakly structured streams, we introduce a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) that reverts to the base predictor when temporal evidence is absent. OATTA is a lightweight, model-agnostic module that incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments across image classification, wearable and physiological signal analysis, and language sentiment analysis demonstrate its universality; OATTA consistently boosts established baselines, improving accuracy by up to 6.35%. Our findings establish that modeling temporal dynamics provides a critical, orthogonal signal beyond standard order-agnostic TTA approaches.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

However, existing Video LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments, especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment, semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with LLM-generated temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision. Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.</p></details> |  |

A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by time precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally-Similar Structure-Aware Spatiotemporal Fusion of Satellite Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11259v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a spatiotemporal (ST) fusion framework robust against diverse noise for satellite images, named Temporally-Similar Structure-Aware ST fusion (TSSTF). ST fusion is a promising approach to address the trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolution of satellite images. In real-world scenarios, observed satellite images are severely degraded by noise due to measurement equipment and environmental conditions. Consequently, some recent studies have focused on enhancing the robustness of ST fusion methods against noise. However, existing noise-robust ST fusion approaches often fail to capture fine spatial structure, leading to oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this issue, TSSTF introduces two key mechanisms: Temporally-Guided Total Variation (TGTV) and Temporally-Guided Edge Constraint (TGEC). TGTV is a weighted total variation-based regularization that promotes spatial piecewise smoothness while preserving structural details, guided by a reference high spatial resolution image acquired on a nearby date. TGEC enforces consistency in edge locations between two temporally adjacent images, while allowing for spectral variations. We formulate the ST fusion task as a constrained optimization problem incorporating TGTV and TGEC, and develop an efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method. Experimental results demonstrate that TSSTF performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods under noise-free conditions and outperforms them under noisy conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2308.00500</p></details> |
| **[Regularized Gradient Temporal-Difference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20599v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient temporal-difference (GTD) learning algorithms are widely used for off-policy policy evaluation with function approximation. However, existing convergence analyses rely on the restrictive assumption that the so-called feature interaction matrix (FIM) is nonsingular. In practice, the FIM can become singular and leads to instability or degraded performance. In this paper, we propose a regularized optimization objective by reformulating the mean-square projected Bellman error (MSPBE) minimization. This formulation naturally yields a regularized GTD algorithms, referred to as R-GTD, which guarantees convergence to a unique solution even when the FIM is singular. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees and explicit error bounds for the proposed method, and validate its effectiveness through empirical experiments.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |

This is due to noise disrupting temporal coherence and increasing the difficulty of learning dynamic regions. {Unfortunately, existing diffusion models rely on static loss for all scenarios, constraining their ability to capture complex dynamics.} To address this issue, we introduce Latent Temporal Discrepancy (LTD) as a motion prior to guide loss weighting. LTD measures frame-to-frame variation in the latent space, assigning larger penalties to regions with higher discrepancy while maintaining regular optimization for stable regions. This motion-aware strategy stabilizes training and enables the model to better reconstruct high-frequency dynamics. Extensive experiments on the general benchmark VBench and the motion-focused VMBench show consistent gains, with our method outperforming strong baselines by 3.31% on VBench and 3.58% on VMBench, achieving significant improvements in motion quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

However, existing CBF-STL approaches typically rely on fixed hyperparameters and per-step optimization, which can lead to overly conservative behavior, infeasibility near tight input limits, and difficulty satisfying long-horizon STL tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a feasibility-aware learning framework that constructs trainable, time-varying High Order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF) constraints and hyperparameters that guarantee satisfaction of a given STL specification. We introduce a unified robustness measure that jointly captures STL satisfaction, constraint feasibility, and control-bound compliance, and propose a neural network architecture to generate control inputs that maximize this robustness. The resulting controller guarantees STL satisfaction with strictly feasible HOCBF constraints and requires no manual tuning. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains high STL robustness under tight input bounds and significantly outperforms fixed-parameter and non-adaptive baselines in complex environments.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

This paper introduces a new paradigm for constructing asymmetric space-time covariances, which we refer to as "reflective asymmetric," by leveraging recently-introduced models for multivariate spatial data. We first provide new results for reflective asymmetric multivariate spatial models that extends their applicability. We then propose their asymmetric space-time extension, which come from a substantially different perspective than Lagrangian asymmetric space-time covariances. There are fewer parameters in the new models, one controls both the spatial and temporal marginal covariances, and the standard separable model is a special case. In simulation studies and analysis of the frequently-studied Irish wind data, these new models also improve model fit and prediction performance, and they can be easier to estimate. These features indicate broad applicability for improved analysis in environmental and other space-time data.</p></details> |  |

Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query-Guided Spatial-Temporal-Frequency Interaction for Music Audio-Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19821v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio--Visual Question Answering (AVQA) is a challenging multimodal task that requires jointly reasoning over audio, visual, and textual information in a given video to answer natural language questions. Inspired by recent advances in Video QA, many existing AVQA approaches primarily focus on visual information processing, leveraging pre-trained models to extract object-level and motion-level representations. However, in those methods, the audio input is primarily treated as complementary to video analysis, and the textual question information contributes minimally to audio--visual understanding, as it is typically integrated only in the final stages of reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Query-guided Spatial--Temporal--Frequency (QSTar) interaction method, which effectively incorporates question-guided clues and exploits the distinctive frequency-domain characteristics of audio signals, alongside spatial and temporal perception, to enhance audio--visual understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a Query Context Reasoning (QCR) block inspired by prompting, which guides the model to focus more precisely on semantically relevant audio and visual features. Extensive experiments conducted on several AVQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving significant performance improvements over existing Audio QA, Visual QA, Video QA, and AVQA approaches. The code and pretrained models will be released after publication.</p></details> |  |

However, silicon-grade correctness remains bottlenecked by: (i) limited test coverage and reliability of simulation-centric evaluation, (ii) regressions and repair hallucinations introduced by iterative debugging, and (iii) semantic drift as intent is reinterpreted across agent handoffs. In this work, we propose Veri-Sure, a multi-agent framework that establishes a design contract to align agents' intent and uses a patching mechanism guided by static dependency slicing to perform precise, localized repairs. By integrating a multi-branch verification pipeline that combines trace-driven temporal analysis with formal verification consisting of assertion-based checking and boolean equivalence proofs, Veri-Sure enables functional correctness beyond pure simulations. We also introduce VerilogEval-v2-EXT, extending the original benchmark with 53 more industrial-grade design tasks and stratified difficulty levels, and show that Veri-Sure achieves state-of-the-art verified-correct RTL code generation performance, surpassing standalone LLMs and prior agentic systems.</p></details> |  |

These challenges are especially relevant in spatio-temporal analyses, where their joint exploration remains limited. To study the effects of fine particulate matter on mortality among elderly people in Italy, we propose a Bayesian spatial dynamic generalized linear model that captures the non-linear exposure-outcome association and decomposes the exposure effect across fine and coarse spatio-temporal scales of variation. Together, these features allow reducing the spatio-temporal confounding bias and recovering the shape of the association, as demonstrated through simulation studies. The real-data analysis reveals a clear temporal pattern in the exposure effect, with peaks during summer months. We argue that this finding may be due to interactions of particulate matter with air temperature and unmeasured confounders.</p></details> | 45 pages, 9 figures |

Building on recent work, we analyse SSM expressiveness through fragments and extensions of linear temporal logic over finite traces. Our results show that the expressive capabilities of SSM vary substantially depending on the underlying gating mechanism. We further distinguish between SSM operating over fixed-width arithmetic (quantised models), whose expressive power remains within regular languages, and SSM with unbounded precision, which can capture counting properties and non-regular languages. In addition, we provide a systematic comparison between these different SSM variants and known results on transformers, thereby clarifying how the two architectures relate in terms of expressive power.</p></details> |  |

Current learning-based methods attempt to leverage ``more" information from both the spatial and the short-term temporal domains, but suffer from unreliable performance under complex conditions while incurring computational redundancy. In this paper, we explore the ``more essential" information from a more crucial domain for the detection. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal that the global temporal saliency and correlation information in the temporal profile demonstrate significant superiority in distinguishing target signals from other signals. To investigate whether such superiority is preferentially leveraged by well-trained networks, we built the first prediction attribution tool in this field and verified the importance of the temporal profile information. Inspired by the above conclusions, we remodel the IRST detection task as a one-dimensional signal anomaly detection task, and propose an efficient deep temporal probe network (DeepPro) that only performs calculations in the time dimension for IRST detection. We conducted extensive experiments to fully validate the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results are exciting, as our DeepPro outperforms existing state-of-the-art IRST detection methods on widely-used benchmarks with extremely high efficiency, and achieves a significant improvement on dim targets and in complex scenarios. We provide a new modeling domain, a new insight, a new method, and a new performance, which can promote the development of IRST detection.

Existing tracking methods optimize for prediction accuracy but ignore pursuit feasibility, resulting in trajectories that are physically impossible to intercept 99.9% of the time. We propose Perception-to-Pursuit (P2P), a track-centric temporal reasoning framework that bridges detection and actionable pursuit planning. Our method represents drone motion as compact 8-dimensional tokens capturing velocity, acceleration, scale, and smoothness, enabling a 12-frame causal transformer to reason about future behavior. We introduce the Intercept Success Rate (ISR) metric to measure pursuit feasibility under realistic interceptor constraints. Evaluated on the Anti-UAV-RGBT dataset with 226 real drone sequences, P2P achieves 28.12 pixel average displacement error and 0.597 ISR, representing a 77% improvement in trajectory prediction and 597x improvement in pursuit feasibility over tracking-only baselines, while maintaining perfect drone classification accuracy (100%). Our work demonstrates that temporal reasoning over motion patterns enables both accurate prediction and actionable pursuit planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, 15 references.

Although powerful multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis, previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by addressing these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce LEMON, a Lecture-based Evaluation benchmark for MultimOdal uNderstanding, focusing on STEM lecture videos that require long-horizon reasoning and cross-modal integration. LEMON comprises 2,277 video segments spanning 5 disciplines and 29 courses, with an average duration of 196.1 seconds, yielding 4,181 high-quality QA pairs, including 3,413 multiple-choice and 768 open-ended questions. Distinct from existing video benchmarks, LEMON features: (1) semantic richness and disciplinary density, (2) tightly coupled video-audio-text modalities, (3) explicit temporal and pedagogical structure, and (4) contextually linked multi-turn questioning. It further encompasses six major tasks and twelve subtasks, covering the full cognitive spectrum from perception to reasoning and then to generation. Comprehensive experiments reveal substantial performance gaps across tasks, highlighting that even state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o struggle with temporal reasoning and instructional prediction. We expect LEMON to serve as an extensible and challenging benchmark for advancing multimodal perception, reasoning, and generation in long-form instructional contents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Knowledge-Graph Memory in a Partially Observable Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05861v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents in partially observable environments require persistent memory to integrate observations over time. While KGs (knowledge graphs) provide a natural representation for such evolving state, existing benchmarks rarely expose agents to environments where both the world dynamics and the agent's memory are explicitly graph-shaped. We introduce the Room Environment v3, a configurable environment whose hidden state is an RDF KG and whose observations are RDF triples. The agent may extend these observations into a temporal KG when storing them in long-term memory. The environment is easily adjustable in terms of grid size, number of rooms, inner walls, and moving objects. We define a lightweight temporal KG memory for agents, based on RDF-star-style qualifiers (time_added, last_accessed, num_recalled), and evaluate several symbolic baselines that maintain and query this memory under different capacity constraints. Two neural sequence models (LSTM and Transformer) serve as contrasting baselines without explicit KG structure. Agents train on one layout and are evaluated on a held-out layout with the same dynamics but a different query order, exposing train-test generalization gaps. In this setting, temporal qualifiers lead to more stable performance, and the symbolic TKG (temporal knowledge graph) agent achieves roughly fourfold higher test QA (question-answer) accuracy than the neural baselines under the same environment and query conditions. The environment, agent implementations, and experimental scripts are released for reproducible research at https://github.com/humemai/agent-room-env-v3 and https://github.com/humemai/room-env.</p></details> |  |
| **[Goal-oriented Semantic Communication for Robot Arm Reconstruction in Digital Twin: Feature and Temporal Selections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08835v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the most promising technologies in industry, the Digital Twin (DT) facilitates real-time monitoring and predictive analysis for real-world systems by precisely reconstructing virtual replicas of physical entities. However, this reconstruction faces unprecedented challenges due to the everincreasing communication overhead, especially for digital robot arm reconstruction. To this end, we propose a novel goal-oriented semantic communication (GSC) framework to extract the GSC information for the robot arm reconstruction task in the DT, with the aim of minimising the communication load under the strict and relaxed reconstruction error constraints. Unlike the traditional reconstruction framework that periodically transmits a reconstruction message for real-time DT reconstruction, our framework implements a feature selection (FS) algorithm to extract the semantic information from the reconstruction message, and a deep reinforcement learning-based temporal selection algorithm to selectively transmit the semantic information over time. We validate our proposed GSC framework through both Pybullet simulations and lab experiments based on the Franka Research 3 robot arm. For a range of distinct robotic tasks, simulation results show that our framework can reduce the communication load by at least 59.5% under strict reconstruction error constraints and 80% under relaxed reconstruction error constraints, compared with traditional communication framework. Also, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our framework, where the communication load is reduced by 53% in strict constraint case and 74% in relaxed constraint case.

| **[Learning temporal embeddings from electronic health records of chronic kidney disease patients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18675v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate whether temporal embedding models trained on longitudinal electronic health records can learn clinically meaningful representations without compromising predictive performance, and how architectural choices affect embedding quality. Model-guided medicine requires representations that capture disease dynamics while remaining transparent and task agnostic, whereas most clinical prediction models are optimised for a single task. Representation learning facilitates learning embeddings that generalise across downstream tasks, and recurrent architectures are well-suited for modelling temporal structure in observational clinical data. Using the MIMIC-IV dataset, we study patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and compare three recurrent architectures: a vanilla LSTM, an attention-augmented LSTM, and a time-aware LSTM (T-LSTM). All models are trained both as embedding models and as direct end-to-end predictors. Embedding quality is evaluated via CKD stage clustering and in-ICU mortality prediction. The T-LSTM produces more structured embeddings, achieving a lower Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI = 9.91) and higher CKD stage classification accuracy (0.74) than the vanilla LSTM (DBI = 15.85, accuracy = 0.63) and attention-augmented LSTM (DBI = 20.72, accuracy = 0.67). For in-ICU mortality prediction, embedding models consistently outperform end-to-end predictors, improving accuracy from 0.72-0.75 to 0.82-0.83, which indicates that learning embeddings as an intermediate step is more effective than direct end-to-end learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

These drawbacks lead to larger data distribution shift, making features less stable for MI-EEG tasks.To address these problems, we introduce STGMFM, a tri-branch framework tailored for dry-electrode MI-EEG, which models complementary spatio-temporal dependencies via dual graph orders, and captures robust envelope dynamics with a multi-scale frequency mixing branch, motivated by the observation that amplitude envelopes are less sensitive to contact variability than instantaneous waveforms. Physiologically meaningful connectivity priors guide learning, and decision-level fusion consolidates a noise-tolerant consensus. On our collected dry-electrode MI-EEG, STGMFM consistently surpasses competitive CNN/Transformer/graph baselines. Codes are available at https://github.com/Tianyi-325/STGMFM.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods rely on fixed workflows and expensive closed-source APIs, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose Temp-R1, the first autonomous end-to-end agent for TKGQA trained through reinforcement learning. To address cognitive overload in single-action reasoning, we expand the action space with specialized internal actions alongside external action. To prevent shortcut learning on simple questions, we introduce reverse curriculum learning that trains on difficult questions first, forcing the development of sophisticated reasoning before transferring to easier cases. Our 8B-parameter Temp-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA, improving 19.8% over strong baselines on complex questions. Our work establishes a new paradigm for autonomous temporal reasoning agents. Our code will be publicly available soon at https://github.com/zjukg/Temp-R1.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[TEFormer: Structured Bidirectional Temporal Enhancement Modeling in Spiking Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18274v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have achieved remarkable progress, with Spiking Transformers emerging as a promising architecture for energy-efficient sequence modeling. However, existing Spiking Transformers still lack a principled mechanism for effective temporal fusion, limiting their ability to fully exploit spatiotemporal dependencies. Inspired by feedforward-feedback modulation in the human visual pathway, we propose TEFormer, the first Spiking Transformer framework that achieves bidirectional temporal fusion by decoupling temporal modeling across its core components. Specifically, TEFormer employs a lightweight and hyperparameter-free forward temporal fusion mechanism in the attention module, enabling fully parallel computation, while incorporating a backward gated recurrent structure in the MLP to aggregate temporal information in reverse order and reinforce temporal consistency. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that TEFormer consistently and significantly outperforms strong SNN and Spiking Transformer baselines under diverse datasets. Moreover, through the first systematic evaluation of Spiking Transformers under different neural encoding schemes, we show that the performance gains of TEFormer remain stable across encoding choices, indicating that the improved temporal modeling directly translates into reliable accuracy improvements across varied spiking representations. These results collectively establish TEFormer as an effective and general framework for temporal modeling in Spiking Transformers.</p></details> | 15pages, 2 figures |

Accurate and robust 2D-3D vessel registration is essential to guide microcatheter and instruments during TACE, enabling precise localization of vascular structures and optimal therapeutic targeting. To tackle this issue, we develop a coarse-to-fine registration strategy. First, we introduce a global alignment module, structure-aware perspective n-point (SA-PnP), to establish correspondence between 2D and 3D vessel structures. Second, we propose TempDiffReg, a temporal diffusion model that performs vessel deformation iteratively by leveraging temporal context to capture complex anatomical variations and local structural changes. We collected data from 23 patients and constructed 626 paired multi-frame samples for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both accuracy and anatomical plausibility. Specifically, our method achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.63 mm and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.51 mm in registration accuracy, representing 66.7\% lower MSE and 17.7\% lower MAE compared to the most competitive existing approaches. It has the potential to assist less-experienced clinicians in safely and efficiently performing complex TACE procedures, ultimately enhancing both surgical outcomes and patient care.

| **[Enhancing Federated Class-Incremental Learning via Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01327v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) enables Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) from distributed data. Existing FCIL methods typically integrate old knowledge preservation into local client training. However, these methods cannot avoid spatial-temporal client drift caused by data heterogeneity and often incur significant computational and communication overhead, limiting practical deployment. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a novel approach, Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation (STSA), which provides a unified framework to aggregate feature statistics both spatially (across clients) and temporally (across stages). The aggregated feature statistics are unaffected by data heterogeneity and can be used to update the classifier in closed form at each stage. Additionally, we introduce STSA-E, a communication-efficient variant with theoretical guarantees, achieving similar performance to STSA-E with much lower communication overhead. Extensive experiments on three widely used FCIL datasets, with varying degrees of data heterogeneity, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FCIL methods in terms of performance, flexibility, and both communication and computation efficiency.

| **[How Much Temporal Modeling is Enough? A Systematic Study of Hybrid CNN-RNN Architectures for Multi-Label ECG Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18830v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals remains challenging due to the coexistence of multiple cardiac conditions, pronounced class imbalance, and long-range temporal dependencies in multi-lead recordings. Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity. This configuration attains superior Hamming loss (0.0338), macro-AUPRC (0.4715), micro-F1 score (0.6979), and subset accuracy (0.5723) compared with deeper recurrent combinations. Although stacked recurrent models occasionally improve recall for specific rare classes, our results provide empirical evidence that increasing recurrent depth yields diminishing returns and may degrade generalization due to reduced precision and overfitting. These findings suggest that architectural alignment with the intrinsic temporal structure of ECG signals, rather than increased recurrent depth, is a key determinant of robust performance and clinically relevant deployment.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

Temporal Focus of Tone Representation under Low-resource Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12285v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lexical tone is central to many languages but remains underexplored in self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models, especially beyond Mandarin. We study four languages with complex and diverse tone systems (Burmese, Thai, Lao, and Vietnamese) to ask how far such models "listen" for tone and how transfer operates in low-resource conditions. As a baseline reference, we estimate the temporal span of tone cues: approximately 100ms (Burmese/Thai) and 180ms (Lao/Vietnamese). Probes and gradient analysis on fine-tuned SSL models reveal that tone transfer varies by downstream task: automatic speech recognition fine-tuning aligns spans with language-specific tone cues, while prosody- and voice-related tasks bias toward overly long spans. These findings indicate that tone transfer is shaped by downstream task, highlighting task effects on temporal focus in tone modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 7 figures, accepted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Video Compression with Hierarchical Temporal Neural Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17743v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video compression has recently benefited from implicit neural representations (INRs), which model videos as continuous functions. INRs offer compact storage and flexible reconstruction, providing a promising alternative to traditional codecs. However, most existing INR-based methods treat the temporal dimension as an independent input, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal dependencies. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Temporal Neural Representation for Videos, TeNeRV. TeNeRV integrates short- and long-term dependencies through two key components. First, an Inter-Frame Feature Fusion (IFF) module aggregates features from adjacent frames, enforcing local temporal coherence and capturing fine-grained motion. Second, a GoP-Adaptive Modulation (GAM) mechanism partitions videos into Groups-of-Pictures and learns group-specific priors. The mechanism modulates network parameters, enabling adaptive representations across different GoPs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TeNeRV consistently outperforms existing INR-based methods in rate-distortion performance, validating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG) construction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of real-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent zero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance on prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as well as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we introduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that builds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from unstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained "atomic" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it constructs atomic TKGs from these facts, employing a dual-time modeling that distinguishes between when information is observed and when it is valid. The resulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~33% better stability, and over ~90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods, demonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EACL 2026</p></details> |

However, predicting multiple fine-grained states of a scene at multiple temporal scales is difficult for vision-language models. We formalize the Multi-Scale Temporal Prediction (MSTP) task in general and surgical scenes by decomposing multi-scale into two orthogonal dimensions: the temporal scale, forecasting states of humans and surgery at varying look-ahead intervals, and the state scale, modeling a hierarchy of states in general and surgical scenes. For example, in general scenes, states of contact relationships are finer-grained than states of spatial relationships. In surgical scenes, medium-level steps are finer-grained than high-level phases yet remain constrained by their encompassing phase. To support this unified task, we introduce the first MSTP Benchmark, featuring synchronized annotations across multiple state scales and temporal scales. We further propose a method, Incremental Generation and Multi-agent Collaboration (IG-MC), which integrates two key innovations. First, we present a plug-and-play incremental generation module that continuously synthesizes up-to-date visual previews at expanding temporal scales to inform multiple decision-making agents, keeping decisions and generated visuals synchronized and preventing performance degradation as look-ahead intervals lengthen. Second, we present a decision-driven multi-agent collaboration framework for multi-state prediction, comprising generation, initiation, and multi-state assessment agents that dynamically trigger and evaluate prediction cycles to balance global coherence and local fidelity.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Complexity Gaps between Point and Interval Temporal Graphs for some Reachability Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11380v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graphs arise when modeling interactions that evolve over time. They usually come in several flavors, depending on the number of parameters used to describe the temporal aspects of the interactions: time of appearance, duration, delay of transmission. In the point model, edges appear at specific points in time, whereas in the more general interval model, edges can be present over specific time intervals. In both models, the delay for traversing an edge can change with each edge appearance. When time is discrete, the two models are equivalent in the sense that the presence of an edge during an interval is equivalent to a sequence of point-in-time occurrences of the edge. However, this transformation can drastically change the size of the input and has implications for complexity. Indeed, we show a gap between the two models with respect to the complexity of the classical problem of computing a fastest temporal path from a source vertex to a target vertex, i.e. a path where edges can be traversed one after another in time and such that the total duration from source to target is minimized. It can be solved in near-linear time in the point model, while we show that the interval model requires quadratic time under classical assumptions of fine-grained complexity. With respect to linear time, our lower bound implies a factor of the number of vertices, while the best known algorithm has a factor of the number of underlying edges. We also show a similar complexity gap for computing a shortest temporal path, i.e. a temporal path with a minimum number of edges. Here our lower bound matches known upper bounds up to a logarithmic factor. Interestingly, we show that near-linear time for fastest temporal path computation is possible in the interval model when it is restricted to uniform delay zero, i.e., when traversing an edge is instantaneous. However, this special case is not exempt from our lower bound for shortest temporal path computation. These two results should be contrasted with the computation of a foremost temporal path, i.e., a temporal path that arrives as early as possible. It is well known that this computation can be solved in near-linear time in both models. We also show that there is no gap in testing the all-to-all temporal connectivity of a temporal graph. We demonstrate a quadratic lower bound that applies to both the interval and point models and aligns with the existing upper bounds.</p></details> |  |

Effective battery health management is essential for battery system safety, cost-efficiency, and sustainability. In this paper, we propose Pace, a physics-aware attentive temporal convolutional network for battery health estimation. Pace integrates raw sensor measurements with battery physics features derived from the equivalent circuit model. We develop three battery-specific modules, including dilated temporal blocks for efficient temporal encoding, chunked attention blocks for context modeling, and a dual-head output block for fusing short- and long-term battery degradation patterns. Together, the modules enable Pace to predict battery health accurately and efficiently in various battery usage conditions. In a large public dataset, Pace performs much better than existing models, achieving an average performance improvement of 6.5 and 2.0x compared to two best-performing baseline models. We further demonstrate its practical viability with a real-time edge deployment on a Raspberry Pi. These results establish Pace as a practical and high-performance solution for battery health analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the ACM Symposium On Applied Computing (SAC), 2026</p></details> |

These approaches suffer from coordination overhead that scales poorly with agent count and task complexity. We propose a fundamentally different paradigm inspired by natural coordination mechanisms: agents operate locally on a shared artifact, guided only by pressure gradients derived from measurable quality signals, with temporal decay preventing premature convergence. We formalize this as optimization over a pressure landscape and prove convergence guarantees under mild conditions. Empirically, on meeting room scheduling across 1,350 trials, pressure-field coordination outperforms all baselines: 48.5% aggregate solve rate versus 12.6% for conversation-based coordination, 1.5% for hierarchical control, and 0.4% for sequential and random baselines (all pairwise comparisons p < 0.001). Temporal decay is essential: disabling it reduces solve rate by 10 percentage points. On easy problems, pressure-field achieves 86.7% solve rate. The approach maintains consistent performance from 1 to 4 agents. Implicit coordination through shared pressure gradients outperforms explicit hierarchical control, suggesting that constraint-driven emergence offers a simpler and more effective foundation for multi-agent AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 figures, 12 tables.

TCP couples a modern quantile forecaster with a rolling split-conformal calibration layer; its \textbf{TCP-RM} variant adds an online Robbins-Monro offset to steer coverage in real time. We benchmark TCP against GARCH, Historical Simulation, Quantile Regression (QR), linear QR, and Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI) across S\&P 500, Bitcoin, and Gold. Three results are consistent. First, QR baselines yield the sharpest intervals but are materially under-calibrated; even ACI remains below the 95\% target. Second, TCP achieves near-nominal coverage, yielding intervals slightly wider than Historical Simulation (e.g., S\&P 500: 5.21 vs.\ 5.06). Third, the RM update changes calibration only marginally at default hyperparameters. Crisis-window visualizations (March 2020) show TCP promptly expanding and contracting intervals as volatility spikes. A sensitivity study confirms robustness to hyperparameters. Overall, TCP bridges statistical inference and machine learning, providing a practical solution for calibrated risk forecasting under distribution shift.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compositional Verification of Concurrency Using Past-Time Temporal Epistemic Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18885v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shared-memory concurrency is difficult to reason about because each thread executes under interference from other threads. At the same time, many correctness arguments for classic algorithms are epistemic: a thread enters a critical region only when, from its local view, it can rule out that another thread is concurrently in that region. We make such arguments explicit by introducing a past-time temporal epistemic logic interpreted over interleaving executions with perfect-recall local histories. Past-time operators support "since" reasoning, while epistemic modalities capture what a given thread can conclude from its own observation history. We give semantics and a sound proof system, instantiate the logic to a simple shared-memory language with instrumented read/write observations, and illustrate the approach on Peterson's mutual exclusion algorithm by proving a local knowledge condition that implies mutual exclusion.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ActionMesh, a generative model that predicts production-ready 3D meshes "in action" in a feed-forward manner. Drawing inspiration from early video models, our key insight is to modify existing 3D diffusion models to include a temporal axis, resulting in a framework we dubbed "temporal 3D diffusion". Specifically, we first adapt the 3D diffusion stage to generate a sequence of synchronized latents representing time-varying and independent 3D shapes. Second, we design a temporal 3D autoencoder that translates a sequence of independent shapes into the corresponding deformations of a pre-defined reference shape, allowing us to build an animation. Combining these two components, ActionMesh generates animated 3D meshes from different inputs like a monocular video, a text description, or even a 3D mesh with a text prompt describing its animation. Besides, compared to previous approaches, our method is fast and produces results that are rig-free and topology consistent, hence enabling rapid iteration and seamless applications like texturing and retargeting. We evaluate our model on standard video-to-4D benchmarks (Consistent4D, Objaverse) and report state-of-the-art performances on both geometric accuracy and temporal consistency, demonstrating that our model can deliver animated 3D meshes with unprecedented speed and quality.</p></details> |  |

Representative queries over such data include range queries, nearest neighbor queries, and join queries. However, formulating those queries usually requires domain-specific expertise and familiarity with executable query languages, which would be a challenging task for non-expert users. It leads to a great demand for well-supported natural language queries (NLQs) in spatio-temporal databases. To bridge the gap between non-experts and query plans in databases, we present NL4ST, an interactive tool that allows users to query spatio-temporal databases in natural language. NL4ST features a three-layer architecture: (i) knowledge base and corpus for knowledge preparation, (ii) natural language understanding for entity linking, and (iii) generating physical plans. Our demonstration will showcase how NL4ST provides effective spatio-temporal physical plans, verified by using four real and synthetic datasets.

Most existing methods construct dense scene representations for occupancy prediction, overlooking the inherent sparsity of real-world driving scenes. Recently, 3D superquadric representation has emerged as a promising sparse alternative to dense scene representations due to the strong geometric expressiveness of superquadrics. However, existing superquadric frameworks still suffer from insufficient temporal modeling, a challenging trade-off between query sparsity and geometric expressiveness, and inefficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting. To address these issues, we propose SuperOcc, a novel framework for superquadric-based 3D occupancy prediction. SuperOcc incorporates three key designs: (1) a cohesive temporal modeling mechanism to simultaneously exploit view-centric and object-centric temporal cues; (2) a multi-superquadric decoding strategy to enhance geometric expressiveness without sacrificing query sparsity; and (3) an efficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting scheme to improve computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the SurroundOcc and Occ3D benchmarks demonstrate that SuperOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency.

An increasingly prominent approach to studying community structure in temporal networks is statistical inference. In the present paper, we study the performance of a class of statistical-inference methods for community detection in temporal networks. We represent temporal networks as multilayer networks, with each layer encoding a time step, and we illustrate that statistical-inference models that generate community assignments via either a uniform distribution on community assignments or discrete-time Markov processes are biased against generating communities with large or small numbers of nodes. In particular, we demonstrate that statistical-inference methods that use such generative models tend to poorly identify community structure in networks with large or small communities. To rectify this issue, we introduce a novel statistical model that generates the community assignments of the nodes in given layer (i.e., at a given time) using all of the community assignments in the previous layer. We prove results that guarantee that our approach greatly mitigates the bias against large and small communities, so using our generative model is beneficial for studying community structure in networks with large or small communities.

| **[Constraint Breeds Generalization: Temporal Dynamics as an Inductive Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23916v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional deep learning prioritizes unconstrained optimization, yet biological systems operate under strict metabolic constraints. We propose that these physical constraints shape dynamics to function not as limitations, but as a temporal inductive bias that breeds generalization. Through a phase-space analysis of signal propagation, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry: expansive dynamics amplify noise, whereas proper dissipative dynamics compress phase space that aligns with the network's spectral bias, compelling the abstraction of invariant features. This condition can be imposed externally via input encoding, or intrinsically through the network's own temporal dynamics. Both pathways require architectures capable of temporal integration and proper constraints to decode induced invariants, whereas static architectures fail to capitalize on temporal structure. Through comprehensive evaluations across supervised classification, unsupervised reconstruction, and zero-shot reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that a critical "transition" regime maximizes generalization capability. These findings establish dynamical constraints as a distinct class of inductive bias, suggesting that robust AI development requires not only scaling and removing limitations, but computationally mastering the temporal characteristics that naturally promote generalization.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Scalable Anytime Algorithms for Learning Fragments of Linear Temporal Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06726v4)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a specification language for finite sequences (called traces) widely used in program verification, motion planning in robotics, process mining, and many other areas. We consider the problem of learning LTL formulas for classifying traces; despite a growing interest of the research community, existing solutions suffer from two limitations: they do not scale beyond small formulas, and they may exhaust computational resources without returning any result. We introduce a new algorithm addressing both issues: our algorithm is able to construct formulas an order of magnitude larger than previous methods, and it is anytime, meaning that it in most cases successfully outputs a formula, albeit possibly not of minimal size. We evaluate the performances of our algorithm using an open source implementation against publicly available benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Thus, for accurately generating contextually-relevant images, knowledge and reasoning about time can be crucial (e.g., for generating a landscape in spring vs. in winter). Yet, although substantial work exists on understanding and improving temporal knowledge in natural language processing, research on how temporal phenomena appear and are handled in text-to-image (T2I) models remains scarce. We address this gap with TempViz, the first data set to holistically evaluate temporal knowledge in image generation, consisting of 7.9k prompts and more than 600 reference images. Using TempViz, we study the capabilities of five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories. Human evaluation shows that temporal competence is generally weak, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy across categories. Towards larger-scale studies, we also examine automated evaluation methods, comparing several established approaches against human judgments. However, none of these approaches provides a reliable assessment of temporal cues - further indicating the pressing need for future research on temporal knowledge in T2I.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIDAL: Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop for High-Frequency VLA Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14945v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer semantic generalization but suffer from high inference latency, limiting them to low-frequency batch-and-execute paradigm. This frequency mismatch creates an execution blind spot, causing failures in dynamic environments where targets move during the open-loop execution window. We propose TIDAL (Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop), a hierarchical framework that decouples semantic reasoning from high-frequency actuation. TIDAL operates as a backbone-agnostic module for diffusion-based VLAs, using a dual-frequency architecture to redistribute the computational budget. Specifically, a low-frequency macro-intent loop caches semantic embeddings, while a high-frequency micro-control loop interleaves single-step flow integration with execution. This design enables approximately 9 Hz control updates on edge hardware (vs. approximately 2.4 Hz baselines) without increasing marginal overhead. To handle the resulting latency shift, we introduce a temporally misaligned training strategy where the policy learns predictive compensation using stale semantic intent alongside real-time proprioception. Additionally, we address the insensitivity of static vision encoders to velocity by incorporating a differential motion predictor. TIDAL is architectural, making it orthogonal to system-level optimizations. Experiments show a 2x performance gain over open-loop baselines in dynamic interception tasks. Despite a marginal regression in static success rates, our approach yields a 4x increase in feedback frequency and extends the effective horizon of semantic embeddings beyond the native action chunk size. Under non-paused inference protocols, TIDAL remains robust where standard baselines fail due to latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[UBATrack: Spatio-Temporal State Space Model for General Multi-Modal Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14799v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal object tracking has attracted considerable attention by integrating multiple complementary inputs (e.g., thermal, depth, and event data) to achieve outstanding performance. Although current general-purpose multi-modal trackers primarily unify various modal tracking tasks (i.e., RGB-Thermal infrared, RGB-Depth or RGB-Event tracking) through prompt learning, they still overlook the effective capture of spatio-temporal cues. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-modal tracking framework based on a mamba-style state space model, termed UBATrack. Our UBATrack comprises two simple yet effective modules: a Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) and a Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer. The former leverages Mamba's long-sequence modeling capability to jointly model cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal visual cues in an adapter-tuning manner. The latter further enhances multi-modal representation capacity across multiple feature dimensions to improve tracking robustness. In this way, UBATrack eliminates the need for costly full-parameter fine-tuning, thereby improving the training efficiency of multi-modal tracking algorithms. Experiments show that UBATrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks, achieving outstanding results on the LasHeR, RGBT234, RGBT210, DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD22, and VisEvent datasets.</p></details> |  |

While multi-frame detection methods leverages temporal cues to improve upon single-frame approaches, existing methods still struggle with inefficient long-range dependency modeling and insufficient robustness. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel scheme for ISTD, realized through a sparse frames-based spatio-temporal semantic feedback network named FeedbackSTS-Det. The core of our approach is a novel spatio-temporal semantic feedback strategy with a closed-loop semantic association mechanism, which consists of paired forward and backward refinement modules that work cooperatively across the encoder and decoder. Moreover, both modules incorporate an embedded sparse semantic module (SSM), which performs structured sparse temporal modeling to capture long-range dependencies with low computational cost. This integrated design facilitates robust implicit inter-frame registration and continuous semantic refinement, effectively suppressing false alarms. Furthermore, our overall procedure maintains a consistent training-inference pipeline, which ensures reliable performance transfer and increases model robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of FeedbackSTS-Det.

Since encoding all frames is prohibitively expensive, uniform sampling is the default choice, but it enforces equal temporal coverage while ignoring the uneven events distribution. This motivates a Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) that selects temporally diverse and event-relevant frames. LFS explicitly models temporal importance to balance temporal diversity and event relevance, and employs a stratified strategy to ensure temporal coverage while avoiding clustering. Crucially, LFS leverages caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs to learn frame selection that directly optimizes downstream caption quality. Additionally, we identify the gap between existing benchmark and human's cognition. Thus, we introduce ICH-CC built from carefully designed questions by annotators that reflect human-consistent understanding of video. Experiments indicate that LFS consistently improves detailed video captioning across two representative community benchmarks and ICH-CC, achieving up to 2.0% gains on VDC and over 4% gains on ICH-CC. Moreover, we observe that enhanced captions with LFS leads to improved performance on video question answering. Overall, LFS provides an effective and easy-to-integrate solution for detailed video captioning.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods mainly learn sequential dependencies from raw trajectories, but often fail to capture high-level behavioral semantics and to effectively disentangle long-term habitual preferences from short-term contextual intentions. In this paper, we propose a semantic embedding based dual stream spatiotemporal attention model for next pickup location prediction. Raw trajectories are first transformed into semantically enriched activity sequences to encode users' stay behaviors and movement semantics. A dual stream architecture is then designed to explicitly decouple long-term historical patterns and short-term dynamic intentions, where each stream employs spatiotemporal attention mechanisms to model dependencies at different temporal scales. To integrate heterogeneous contextual information, a context aware dynamic fusion module adaptively balances the contributions of the two streams. Finally, an attention based matching strategy is used to predict the probability distribution over candidate pickup locations. Experiments on real world ride hailing datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state of the art methods, validating the effectiveness of semantic trajectory abstraction and dual stream spatiotemporal attention for individualized mobility behavior modeling.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing video customization methods rely on reference images or task-specific temporal priors, failing to fully exploit the rich spatio-temporal information inherent in videos, thereby limiting flexibility and generalization in video generation. To address these limitations, we propose OmniTransfer, a unified framework for spatio-temporal video transfer. It leverages multi-view information across frames to enhance appearance consistency and exploits temporal cues to enable fine-grained temporal control. To unify various video transfer tasks, OmniTransfer incorporates three key designs: Task-aware Positional Bias that adaptively leverages reference video information to improve temporal alignment or appearance consistency; Reference-decoupled Causal Learning separating reference and target branches to enable precise reference transfer while improving efficiency; and Task-adaptive Multimodal Alignment using multimodal semantic guidance to dynamically distinguish and tackle different tasks. Extensive experiments show that OmniTransfer outperforms existing methods in appearance (ID and style) and temporal transfer (camera movement and video effects), while matching pose-guided methods in motion transfer without using pose, establishing a new paradigm for flexible, high-fidelity video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github Page: https://pangzecheung.github.io/OmniTransfer/</p></details> |

While substantial works continue to rely on the popular but old benchmarks, their temporal misalignment with real-world facts and modern LLMs, and their effects on LLM factuality evaluation remain underexplored. Therefore, in this work, we present a systematic investigation of this issue by examining five popular factuality benchmarks and eight LLMs released across different years. An up-to-date fact retrieval pipeline and three metrics are tailored to quantify benchmark aging and its impact on LLM factuality evaluation. Experimental results and analysis illustrate that a considerable portion of samples in the widely used factuality benchmarks are outdated, leading to unreliable assessments of LLM factuality. We hope our work can provide a testbed to assess the reliability of a benchmark for LLM factuality evaluation and inspire more research on the benchmark aging issue.

This limitation introduces significant geometric distortion when representing real-world graphs with inherent non-Euclidean structures (e.g., hierarchies and cycles), degrading representation quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for RLSTG, extending stability theorems of LTCs to the Riemannian domain and quantifying its expressive power via state trajectory analysis. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that, by combining advanced temporal dynamics with a Riemannian spatial representation, RLSTG achieves superior performance on graphs with complex structures.

Lately, transformer networks, through their self-attention mechanism capabilities, have proved their efficiency in many applications. In this study, we introduce a new two-stream transformer video classifier, which extracts spatio-temporal information from content and optical flow representing movement information. The proposed model identifies self-attention features across the joint optical flow and temporal frame domain and represents their relationships within the transformer encoder mechanism. The experimental results show that our proposed methodology provides excellent classification results on three well-known video datasets of human activities.</p></details> |  |

Such VCSPs will be called temporal, in analogy to the (classical) constraint satisfaction problem: a relational structure is preserved by all order-preserving bijections if and only if all its relations have a first-order definition in $({\mathbb Q};<)$, and the CSPs for such structures are called temporal CSPs. Many optimization problems that have been studied intensively in the literature can be phrased as a temporal VCSP. We prove that a temporal VCSP is in P, or NP-complete. Our analysis uses the concept of fractional polymorphisms. This is the first dichotomy result for VCSPs over infinite domains which is complete in the sense that it treats all valued structures with a given automorphism group.</p></details> |  |
| **[STEC: A Reference-Free Spatio-Temporal Entropy Coverage Metric for Evaluating Sampled Video Frames](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13974v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frame sampling is a fundamental component in video understanding and video--language model pipelines, yet evaluating the quality of sampled frames remains challenging. Existing evaluation metrics primarily focus on perceptual quality or reconstruction fidelity, and are not designed to assess whether a set of sampled frames adequately captures informative and representative video content. We propose Spatio-Temporal Entropy Coverage (STEC), a simple and non-reference metric for evaluating the effectiveness of video frame sampling. STEC builds upon Spatio-Temporal Frame Entropy (STFE), which measures per-frame spatial information via entropy-based structural complexity, and evaluates sampled frames based on their temporal coverage and redundancy. By jointly modeling spatial information strength, temporal dispersion, and non-redundancy, STEC provides a principled and lightweight measure of sampling quality. Experiments on the MSR-VTT test-1k benchmark demonstrate that STEC clearly differentiates common sampling strategies, including random, uniform, and content-aware methods. We further show that STEC reveals robustness patterns across individual videos that are not captured by average performance alone, highlighting its practical value as a general-purpose evaluation tool for efficient video understanding. We emphasize that STEC is not designed to predict downstream task accuracy, but to provide a task-agnostic diagnostic signal for analyzing frame sampling behavior under constrained budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper corresponds to the camera-ready version of a WACV 2026 Workshop paper</p></details> |

We propose Temporal Physics-Informed AI (TPI-AI), a hybrid framework that fuses deep temporal representations with physics-inspired interaction cues. A two-layer bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) encoder learns compact embeddings from multi-step trajectory histories; we concatenate these embeddings with kinematics-, safety-, and interaction-aware features (e.g., headway, TTC, and safe-gap indicators) and train a LightGBM classifier for three-class intention recognition (No-LC, Left-LC, Right-LC). To improve minority-class reliability, we apply imbalance-aware optimization including resampling/weighting and fold-wise threshold calibration. Experiments on two large-scale drone-based datasets, highD (straight highways) and exiD (ramp-rich environments), use location-based splits and evaluate prediction horizons T = 1, 2, 3 s. TPI-AI outperforms standalone LightGBM and Bi-LSTM baselines, achieving macro-F1 of 0.9562, 0.9124, 0.8345 on highD and 0.9247, 0.8197, 0.7605 on exiD at T = 1, 2, 3 s, respectively. These results show that combining physics-informed interaction features with learned temporal embeddings yields robust multi-scenario lane-change intention prediction.</p></details> |  |

By monitoring a given STL specification, we can detect the executions that violate it, which are often referred to as counterexamples. In practice, these counterexamples may arise from different causes and thus are relevant to different system defects. To effectively address this, we need a proper criterion for classifying these counterexamples, by which we can comprehend the possible violation patterns and the distributions of these counterexamples with respect to the patterns. In this paper, we propose a classification criterion by using parametric signal temporal logic (PSTL) to represent each class. Due to this formalism, identifying the classes of a counterexample requires finding proper parameter values of PSTL that enable a class to include the counterexample. To improve the efficiency of class identification, we further derive an inclusion relation between different classes, and then propose a binary search-like approach over it that significantly prunes the classes needed to query. We implement a prototype tool and experimentally evaluate its effectiveness on two widely-studied systems.</p></details> |  |

We present ActAvatar, a framework that achieves phase-level precision in action control through textual guidance by capturing both action semantics and temporal context. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) Phase-Aware Cross-Attention (PACA), which decomposes prompts into a global base block and temporally-anchored phase blocks, enabling the model to concentrate on phase-relevant tokens for precise temporal-semantic alignment; (2) Progressive Audio-Visual Alignment, which aligns modality influence with the hierarchical feature learning process-early layers prioritize text for establishing action structure while deeper layers emphasize audio for refining lip movements, preventing modality interference; (3) A two-stage training strategy that first establishes robust audio-visual correspondence on diverse data, then injects action control through fine-tuning on structured annotations, maintaining both audio-visual alignment and the model's text-following capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActAvatar significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both action control and visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ziqiaopeng.github.io/ActAvatar/</p></details> |

Mainstream approaches based on modality-invariant and modality-specific factorization or on complex fusion still rely on spatiotemporal mixed modeling. This ignores spatiotemporal heterogeneity, leading to spatiotemporal information asymmetry and thus limited performance. Hence, we propose TSDA, Temporal-Spatial Decouple before Act, which explicitly decouples each modality into temporal dynamics and spatial structural context before any interaction. For every modality, a temporal encoder and a spatial encoder project signals into separate temporal and spatial body. Factor-Consistent Cross-Modal Alignment then aligns temporal features only with their temporal counterparts across modalities, and spatial features only with their spatial counterparts. Factor specific supervision and decorrelation regularization reduce cross factor leakage while preserving complementarity. A Gated Recouple module subsequently recouples the aligned streams for task. Extensive experiments show that TSDA outperforms baselines.

The temporal version of that task, temporal knowledge graph extraction (TKGE), involves extracting temporally grounded facts from text, represented as semantic quadruples (subject, relation, object, timestamp). Many recent systems take advantage of large language models (LLMs), which are becoming a new cornerstone of the web due to their performance on many tasks across the natural language processing (NLP) field. Despite the importance of TKGE, existing datasets for training and evaluation remain scarce, and contamination of evaluation data is an unaddressed issue, potentially inflating LLMs' perceived performance due to overlaps between training and evaluation sets. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel synthetic evaluation dataset constructed from predicted future, previously unseen temporal facts, thereby eliminating contamination and enabling robust and unbiased benchmarking. Our dataset creation involves a two-step approach: (1) Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting (TKGF) generates plausible future quadruples, which are subsequently filtered to adhere to the original knowledge base schema; (2) LLMs perform quadruple-to-text generation, creating semantically aligned textual descriptions. We benchmark Extract, Define and Canonicalize (EDC), a state-of-the-art LLM-based extraction framework, demonstrating that LLM performance decreases when evaluated on our dataset compared to a dataset of known facts. We publicly release our dataset consisting of 4.2K future quadruples and corresponding textual descriptions, along with the generation methodology, enabling continuous creation of unlimited future temporal datasets to serve as long-term, contamination-free benchmarks for TKGE.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Despite strong performance, existing confidence estimation methods typically reduce an entire reasoning process to a single scalar score, ignoring how confidence evolves throughout the generation. As a result, these methods are often sensitive to superficial factors such as response length or verbosity, and struggle to distinguish correct reasoning from confidently stated errors. We propose to characterize the stepwise confidence signal using Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Using a discriminative STL mining procedure, we discover temporal formulas that distinguish confidence signals of correct and incorrect responses. Our analysis found that the STL patterns generalize across tasks, and numeric parameters exhibit sensitivity to individual questions. Based on these insights, we develop a confidence estimation approach that informs STL blocks with parameter hypernetworks. Experiments on multiple reasoning tasks show our confidence scores are more calibrated than the baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recurrent Confidence Chain: Temporal-Aware Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13368v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As reasoning modules, such as the chain-of-thought mechanism, are applied to large language models, they achieve strong performance on various tasks such as answering common-sense questions and solving math problems. The main challenge now is to assess the uncertainty of answers, which can help prevent misleading or serious hallucinations for users. Although current methods analyze long reasoning sequences by filtering unrelated tokens and examining potential connections between nearby tokens or sentences, the temporal spread of confidence is often overlooked. This oversight can lead to inflated overall confidence, even when earlier steps exhibit very low confidence. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that incorporates inter-step attention to analyze semantic correlations across steps. For handling long-horizon responses, we introduce a hidden confidence mechanism to retain historical confidence information, which is then combined with stepwise confidence to produce a more accurate overall estimate. We evaluate our method on the GAOKAO math benchmark and the CLadder causal reasoning dataset using mainstream open-source large language models. Our approach is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods by achieving a superior balance between predictive quality and calibration, demonstrated by strong performance on both Negative Log-Likelihood and Expected Calibration Error.</p></details> |  |
| **[Verifying First-Order Temporal Properties of Infinite-State Systems via Timers and Rankings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13325v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a unified deductive verification framework for first-order temporal properties based on well-founded rankings, where verification conditions are discharged using SMT solvers. To that end, we introduce a novel reduction from verification of arbitrary temporal properties to verification of termination. Our reduction augments the system with prophecy timer variables that predict the number of steps along a trace until the next time certain temporal formulas, including the negated property, hold. In contrast to standard tableaux-based reductions, which reduce the problem to fair termination, our reduction does not introduce fairness assumptions. To verify termination of the augmented system, we follow the traditional approach of assigning each state a rank from a well-founded set and showing that the rank decreases in every transition. We leverage the recently proposed formalism of implicit rankings to express and automatically verify the decrease of rank using SMT solvers, even when the rank is not expressible in first-order logic. We extend implicit rankings from finite to infinite domains, enabling verification of more general systems and making them applicable to the augmented systems generated by our reduction, which allows us to exploit the decrease of timers in termination proofs. We evaluate our technique on a range of temporal verification tasks from previous works, giving simple, intuitive proofs for them within our framework.</p></details> |  |

Current LLM architectures and evaluation protocols rarely test for temporal awareness under real-time deadlines. We use simulated negotiations between paired agents under strict deadlines to investigate how LLMs adjust their behavior in time-sensitive settings. In a control condition, agents know only the global time limit. In a time-aware condition, they receive remaining-time updates at each turn. Deal closure rates are substantially higher (32\% vs. 4\% for GPT-5.1) and offer acceptances are sixfold higher in the time-aware condition than in the control, suggesting LLMs struggle to internally track elapsed time. However, the same LLMs achieve near-perfect deal closure rates ($\geq$95\%) under turn-based limits, revealing the failure is in temporal tracking rather than strategic reasoning. These effects replicate across negotiation scenarios and models, illustrating a systematic lack of LLM time awareness that will constrain LLM deployment in many time-sensitive applications.</p></details> |  |

Despite long-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and accurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and random shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal Perception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical motion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in an end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to capture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained perception progressively refines the object-level features using previous outputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation. Because there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation, we manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on GasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such as gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)</p></details> |

Point processes specified on linear networks can provide a more accurate description of crime incidents by considering the geometry of the city. We propose a spatio-temporal Dirichlet process mixture model on a linear network to analyze crime events in Valencia, Spain. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with a Dirichlet process prior to automatically detect space-time clusters of the events and adopt a convolution kernel estimator to account for the network structure in the city. From the fitted model, we provide crime hotspot visualizations that can inform social interventions to prevent crime incidents. Furthermore, we study the relationships between the detected cluster centers and the city's amenities, which provides an intuitive explanation of criminal contagion.</p></details> |  |

However, it faces two major challenges: (1) demographic-based targeting creates segment-specific LTV distributions with large value variations across user groups; and (2) dynamic marketing strategies generate irregular behavioral sequences where engagement patterns evolve rapidly. We propose a Hyper-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HT-GNN), which jointly models demographic heterogeneity and temporal dynamics through three key components: (i) a hypergraph-supervised module capturing inter-segment relationships; (ii) a transformer-based temporal encoder with adaptive weighting; and (iii) a task-adaptive mixture-of-experts with dynamic prediction towers for multi-horizon LTV forecasting. Experiments on \textit{Baidu Ads} with 15 million users demonstrate that HT-GNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics and prediction horizons.</p></details> |  |

While advances in semantic scene representations have enriched robotic scene understanding, current approaches lack a connection between spatial features and dynamic events; e.g., connecting the blue mug to the event washing a mug. In this work, we introduce the event-grounding graph (EGG), a framework grounding event interactions to spatial features of a scene. This representation allows robots to perceive, reason, and respond to complex spatio-temporal queries. Experiments using real robotic data demonstrate EGG's capability to retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human inquiries concerning the environment and events within. Furthermore, the EGG framework's source code and evaluation dataset are released as open-source at: https://github.com/aalto-intelligent-robotics/EGG.</p></details> | Submitted to RA-L |

Compared with existing static graph clustering, it can find the balance between time requirement and space requirement (Time-Space Balance) through the interaction sequence-based batch-processing pattern. However, there are two major challenges that hinder the development of TGC, i.e., inapplicable clustering techniques and inapplicable datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive benchmark, called BenchTGC. Specially, we design a BenchTGC Framework to illustrate the paradigm of temporal graph clustering and improve existing clustering techniques to fit temporal graphs. In addition, we also discuss problems with public temporal graph datasets and develop multiple datasets suitable for TGC task, called BenchTGC Datasets. According to extensive experiments, we not only verify the advantages of BenchTGC, but also demonstrate the necessity and importance of TGC task. We wish to point out that the dynamically changing and complex scenarios in real world are the foundation of temporal graph clustering. The code and data is available at: https://github.com/MGitHubL/BenchTGC.</p></details> |  |

We investigate Temporal Envy-Freeness Up to One Good (TEF1) and Up to Any Good (TEFX), its approximation $α$-TEFX, and Temporal Maximin Share (TMMS). Motivated by known impossibilities in standard settings, we consider the model in various restricted settings and extend it by introducing scheduling. Our main contributions draw the boundary between possibility and impossibility. First, regarding temporal fair division without scheduling, we prove that while constant-factor $α$-TEFX is impossible in general, a $1/2$-approximation is achievable for generalized binary valuations and identical days with two agents. Second, regarding temporal fair division with scheduling, we demonstrate that a scheduling buffer of size at least $n/2$ enables TEF1 for identical days. However, we establish that TEFX and TMMS remain largely impossible even with scheduling or restricted domains. These results highlight the inherent difficulty of strict temporal fairness and quantify the trade-offs required to achieve approximation guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IJCAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Towards Temporal Fusion Beyond the Field of View for Camera-based Semantic Scene Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12498v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) methods have increasingly explored leveraging temporal cues to enrich the features of the current frame. However, while these approaches primarily focus on enhancing in-frame regions, they often struggle to reconstruct critical out-of-frame areas near the sides of the ego-vehicle, although previous frames commonly contain valuable contextual information about these unseen regions. To address this limitation, we propose the Current-Centric Contextual 3D Fusion (C3DFusion) module, which generates hidden region-aware 3D feature geometry by explicitly aligning 3D-lifted point features from both current and historical frames. C3DFusion performs enhanced temporal fusion through two complementary techniques-historical context blurring and current-centric feature densification-which suppress noise from inaccurately warped historical point features by attenuating their scale, and enhance current point features by increasing their volumetric contribution. Simply integrated into standard SSC architectures, C3DFusion demonstrates strong effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets. Furthermore, it exhibits robust generalization, achieving notable performance gains when applied to other baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[A Graph Prompt Fine-Tuning Method for WSN Spatio-Temporal Correlation Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12745v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection of multi-temporal modal data in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can provide an important guarantee for reliable network operation. Existing anomaly detection methods in multi-temporal modal data scenarios have the problems of insufficient extraction of spatio-temporal correlation features, high cost of anomaly sample category annotation, and imbalance of anomaly samples. In this paper, a graph neural network anomaly detection backbone network incorporating spatio-temporal correlation features and a multi-task self-supervised training strategy of "pre-training - graph prompting - fine-tuning" are designed for the characteristics of WSN graph structure data. First, the anomaly detection backbone network is designed by improving the Mamba model based on a multi-scale strategy and inter-modal fusion method, and combining it with a variational graph convolution module, which is capable of fully extracting spatio-temporal correlation features in the multi-node, multi-temporal modal scenarios of WSNs. Secondly, we design a three-subtask learning "pre-training" method with no-negative comparative learning, prediction, and reconstruction to learn generic features of WSN data samples from unlabeled data, and design a "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning. The model is fine-tuned through the "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning model to complete the parameter fine-tuning, thereby reducing the training cost and enhancing the detection generalization performance. The F1 metrics obtained from experiments on the public dataset and the actual collected dataset are up to 91.30% and 92.31%, respectively, which provides better detection performance and generalization ability than existing methods designed by the method.</p></details> |  |

However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

However, realizing these benefits in practice is non-trivial, as dLLMs inherently face an accuracy-parallelism trade-off. Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/d3LLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Guided Diffusion for Foreground-Preserving Background Generation in Multi-Layer Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21857v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a diffusion-based framework for document-centric background generation that achieves foreground preservation and multi-page stylistic consistency through latent-space design rather than explicit constraints. Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents. By reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, we offer a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling.</p></details> | 47 pages, 36 figures |

Existing methods often struggle to maintain global directional consistency, leading to drifting or implausible trajectories when extrapolated over long time horizons. To address this issue, we propose a semantic-key-point-conditioned trajectory modeling framework, in which future trajectories are predicted by conditioning on a high-level Next Key Point (NKP) that captures navigational intent. This formulation decomposes long-horizon prediction into global semantic decision-making and local motion modeling, effectively restricting the support of future trajectories to semantically feasible subsets. To efficiently estimate the NKP prior from historical observations, we adopt a pretrain-finetune strategy. Extensive experiments on real-world AIS data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly for long travel durations, directional accuracy, and fine-grained trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASTRA: Automated Synthesis of agentic Trajectories and Reinforcement Arenas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21558v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as tool-augmented agents for multi-step decision making, yet training robust tool-using agents remains challenging. Existing methods still require manual intervention, depend on non-verifiable simulated environments, rely exclusively on either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), and struggle with stable long-horizon, multi-turn learning. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRA, a fully automated end-to-end framework for training tool-augmented language model agents via scalable data synthesis and verifiable reinforcement learning. ASTRA integrates two complementary components. First, a pipeline that leverages the static topology of tool-call graphs synthesizes diverse, structurally grounded trajectories, instilling broad and transferable tool-use competence. Second, an environment synthesis framework that captures the rich, compositional topology of human semantic reasoning converts decomposed question-answer traces into independent, code-executable, and rule-verifiable environments, enabling deterministic multi-turn RL. Based on this method, we develop a unified training methodology that integrates SFT with online RL using trajectory-level rewards to balance task completion and interaction efficiency. Experiments on multiple agentic tool-use benchmarks demonstrate that ASTRA-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales, approaching closed-source systems while preserving core reasoning ability. We release the full pipelines, environments, and trained models at https://github.com/LianjiaTech/astra.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios: weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance, which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative models for interactive systems. https://guillem-cf.github.io/JointDiff/</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[TRACE: Trajectory Recovery for Continuous Mechanism Evolution in Causal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21135v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal causal representation learning methods assume that causal mechanisms switch instantaneously between discrete domains, yet real-world systems often exhibit continuous mechanism transitions. For example, a vehicle's dynamics evolve gradually through a turning maneuver, and human gait shifts smoothly from walking to running. We formalize this setting by modeling transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finitely many atomic mechanisms, governed by time-varying mixing coefficients. Our theoretical contributions establish that both the latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are jointly identifiable. We further propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework where each expert learns one atomic mechanism during training, enabling recovery of mechanism trajectories at test time. This formulation generalizes to intermediate mechanism states never observed during training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that TRACE recovers mixing trajectories with up to 0.99 correlation, substantially outperforming discrete-switching baselines.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

Optimizing the trajectory over the full racing horizon is computationally expensive, and tracking such a trajectory in the real world hardly assures global optimality due to uncertain dynamics. Yet, existing work mostly focuses on dynamics learning at the tracking level, without updating the trajectory itself to account for the learned dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a track-centric approach that directly learns and optimizes the full-horizon trajectory. We first represent trajectories through a track-agnostic parametric space in light of the wavelet transform. This space is then efficiently explored using Bayesian optimization, where the lap time of each candidate is evaluated by running simulations with the learned dynamics. This optimization is embedded in an iterative learning framework, where the optimized trajectory is deployed to collect real-world data for updating the dynamics, progressively refining the trajectory over the iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating lap time improvement of up to 20.7% over a nominal baseline and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Modular pipelines restrict information flow and can amplify upstream errors. Recent query-based, fully differentiable perception-and-prediction (PnP) models mitigate these issues, yet the complementarity of cameras and LiDAR in the query-space has not been sufficiently explored. Models often rely on fusion schemes that introduce heuristic alignment and discrete selection steps which prevent full utilization of available information and can introduce unwanted bias. We propose Li-ViP3D++, a query-based multimodal PnP framework that introduces Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to integrate multi-view RGB and LiDAR in query space. QGDF (i) aggregates image evidence via masked attention across cameras and feature levels, (ii) extracts LiDAR context through fully differentiable BEV sampling with learned per-query offsets, and (iii) applies query-conditioned gating to adaptively weight visual and geometric cues per agent. The resulting architecture jointly optimizes detection, tracking, and multi-hypothesis trajectory forecasting in a single end-to-end model. On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ improves end-to-end behavior and detection quality, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502) while substantially reducing false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and it is faster than the prior Li-ViP3D variant (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms). These results indicate that query-space, fully differentiable camera-LiDAR fusion can increase robustness of end-to-end PnP without sacrificing deployability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This paper presents a scalable alternative: high-accuracy whole-body touch localization via vibro-acoustic sensing. By equipping a robotic hand with seven low-cost piezoelectric microphones and leveraging an Audio Spectrogram Transformer, we decode the vibrational signatures generated during physical interaction. Extensive evaluation across stationary and dynamic tasks reveals a localization error of under 5 mm in static conditions. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the distinct influence of material properties: stiff materials (e.g., metal) excel in impulse response localization due to sharp, high-bandwidth responses, whereas textured materials (e.g., wood) provide superior friction-based features for trajectory tracking. The system demonstrates robustness to the robot's own motion, maintaining effective tracking even during active operation. Our primary contribution is demonstrating that complex physical contact dynamics can be effectively decoded from simple vibrational signals, offering a viable pathway to widespread, affordable contact perception in robotics. To accelerate research, we provide our full datasets, models, and experimental setups as open-source resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review: Springer Autonomous Robots Journal</p></details> |

We argue that current evaluation paradigms suffer from an unanchored defect, leading to two forms of instability: process drift, where unsteered client simulation wanders away from specific counseling goals, and standard drift, where static pointwise scoring lacks the stability for reliable judgment. To address this, we introduce Ps, a unified framework that calibrates the therapeutic competence of LLMs via trajectory-anchored tournaments. We first anchor the interaction trajectory in simulation, where clients precisely control the fluid consultation process to probe multifaceted capabilities. We then anchor the battle trajectory in judgments through an efficient Swiss-system tournament, utilizing dynamic pairwise battles to yield robust Elo ratings. Beyond ranking, we demonstrate that tournament trajectories can be transformed into credible reward signals, enabling on-policy reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PsychePass and its strong consistency with human expert judgments.</p></details> |  |

Learning-based MAPF solvers offer fast and scalable planning but often produce feasible trajectories that contain unnecessary or oscillatory movements. We propose Judgelight, a post-optimization layer that improves trajectory quality after a MAPF solver generates a feasible schedule. Judgelight collapses closed subwalks in agents' trajectories to remove redundant movements while preserving all feasibility constraints. We formalize this process as MAPF-Collapse, prove that it is NP-hard, and present an exact optimization approach by formulating it as integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Experimental results show Judgelight consistently reduces solution cost by around 20%, particularly for learning-based solvers, producing trajectories that are better suited for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Out-of-Distribution Generalization via Invariant Trajectories for Multimodal Large Language Model Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19700v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.</p></details> |  |

To this end, a deep autoencoder (DAE) model is employed to infer the ID in the weakly nonlinear regime ($β\lesssim 1$). We find that the trajectories lie on a nonlinear manifold of dimension $m^{\ast} = 2$ embedded in a $64$-dimensional phase space. The DAE further reveals that this dimensionality increases to $m^{\ast} = 3$ at $β= 1.1$, coinciding with a symmetry breaking transition, in which additional energy modes with even wave numbers $k = 2, 4$ become excited. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the linear approach based on principal component analysis (PCA), which fails to capture the underlying structure of the data and therefore yields unreliable results in most cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures.

Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDF) enable fixed-base manipulators to model collisions directly in configuration space via smooth, implicit distances. This representation holds strong potential to bypass the nonlinear configuration-to-workspace mapping while preserving accurate whole-body geometry and providing optimization-friendly collision costs. Yet, extending this capability to mobile manipulators is hindered by unbounded workspaces and tighter base-arm coupling. We lift this promise to mobile manipulation with Generalized Configuration Space Distance Fields (GCDF), extending CDF to robots with both translational and rotational joints in unbounded workspaces with tighter base-arm coupling. We prove that GCDF preserves Euclidean-like local distance structure and accurately encodes whole-body geometry in configuration space, and develop a data generation and training pipeline that yields continuous neural GCDFs with accurate values and gradients, supporting efficient GPU-batched queries. Building on this representation, we develop a high-performance sequential convex optimization framework centered on GCDF-based collision reasoning. The solver scales to large numbers of implicit constraints through (i) online specification of neural constraints, (ii) sparsity-aware active-set detection with parallel batched evaluation across thousands of constraints, and (iii) incremental constraint management for rapid replanning under scene changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Video Generation for Robotic Manipulation with Collaborative Trajectory Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01943v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video diffusion models shows promise for generating robotic decision-making data, with trajectory conditions further enabling fine-grained control. However, existing methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex manipulation. This limitation arises from entangled features in overlapping regions, leading to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics via a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction, and models each phase using the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction. This design effectively alleviates the multi-object feature fusion issue in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency across the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge dataset, as well as RLBench and SIMPLER benchmarks, demonstrate that our method establishs new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.

We propose Generative Chain of Behavior (GCB), a generative framework that models user interactions as an autoregressive chain of semantic behaviors over multiple future steps. GCB first encodes items into semantic IDs via RQ-VAE with k-means refinement, forming a discrete latent space that preserves semantic proximity. On top of this space, a transformer-based autoregressive generator predicts multi-step future behaviors conditioned on user history, capturing long-horizon intent transitions and generating coherent trajectories. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that GCB consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommenders in multi-step accuracy and trajectory consistency. Beyond these gains, GCB offers a unified generative formulation for capturing user preference evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Refusal Circuits Across LLMs: Cross-Model Transfer via Trajectory Replay and Concept-Basis Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16034v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refusal behavior in aligned LLMs is often viewed as model-specific, yet we hypothesize it stems from a universal, low-dimensional semantic circuit shared across models. To test this, we introduce Trajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction, a framework that transfers refusal interventions from donor to target models, spanning diverse architectures (e.g., Dense to MoE) and training regimes, without using target-side refusal supervision. By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space. To preserve capabilities, we introduce a weight-SVD stability guard that projects interventions away from high-variance weight subspaces to prevent collateral damage. Our evaluation across 8 model pairs confirms that these transferred recipes consistently attenuate refusal while maintaining performance, providing strong evidence for the semantic universality of safety alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Trajectory Representation Learning for Travel Time Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05840v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, traditional approaches typically convert trajectory data into fixed-length representations. This overlooks the inherent variability of real-world motion patterns, often resulting in information loss and redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance the performance of TTE. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a multimodal fusion module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics, while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong generalization abilities. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/City-Computing/MDTI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Reasoning Trajectories for Hallucination Detection via Answer-agreement Representation Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17467v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) often generate long, seemingly coherent reasoning traces yet still produce incorrect answers, making hallucination detection challenging. Although trajectories contain useful signals, directly using trace text or vanilla hidden states for detection is brittle: traces vary in form and detectors can overfit to superficial patterns rather than answer validity. We introduce Answer-agreement Representation Shaping (ARS), which learns detection-friendly trace-conditioned representations by explicitly encoding answer stability. ARS generates counterfactual answers through small latent interventions, specifically, perturbing the trace-boundary embedding, and labels each perturbation by whether the resulting answer agrees with the original. It then learns representations that bring answer-agreeing states together and separate answer-disagreeing ones, exposing latent instability indicative of hallucination risk. The shaped embeddings are plug-and-play with existing embedding-based detectors and require no human annotations during training. Experiments demonstrate that ARS consistently improves detection and achieves substantial gains over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches focus on single learning experiences and do not account for students' gradual knowledge construction and evolving skill sets. Moreover, large language models are optimized to produce direct and accurate responses, making it challenging to represent the incomplete understanding and developmental constraints that characterize real learners. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for memory-based student simulation that incorporates developmental trajectories through a hierarchical memory mechanism with structured knowledge representation. The framework also integrates metacognitive processes and personality traits to enrich the individual learner profiling, through dynamical consolidation of both cognitive development and personal learning characteristics. In practice, we implement a curriculum-aligned simulator grounded on the Next Generation Science Standards. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively reflect the gradual nature of knowledge development and the characteristic difficulties students face, providing a more accurate representation of learning processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed some grammar and format issues.

| **[Hierarchical Informative Path Planning via Graph Guidance and Trajectory Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17227v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study informative path planning (IPP) with travel budgets in cluttered environments, where an agent collects measurements of a latent field modeled as a Gaussian process (GP) to reduce uncertainty at target locations. Graph-based solvers provide global guarantees but assume pre-selected measurement locations, while continuous trajectory optimization supports path-based sensing but is computationally intensive and sensitive to initialization in obstacle-dense settings. We propose a hierarchical framework with three stages: (i) graph-based global planning, (ii) segment-wise budget allocation using geometric and kernel bounds, and (iii) spline-based refinement of each segment with hard constraints and obstacle pruning. By combining global guidance with local refinement, our method achieves lower posterior uncertainty than graph-only and continuous baselines, while running faster than continuous-space solvers (up to 9x faster than gradient-based methods and 20x faster than black-box optimizers) across synthetic cluttered environments and Arctic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Trajectory Alignment Coefficient in Two Acts: From Reward Tuning to Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16906v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of reinforcement learning (RL) is fundamentally tied to having a reward function that accurately reflects the task objective. Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents HumanDiffusion, a lightweight image-conditioned diffusion planner that generates human-aware navigation trajectories directly from RGB imagery. The system combines YOLO-11 based human detection with diffusion-driven trajectory generation, enabling a quadrotor to approach a target person and deliver medical assistance without relying on prior maps or computationally intensive planning pipelines. Trajectories are predicted in pixel space, ensuring smooth motion and a consistent safety margin around humans. We evaluate HumanDiffusion in simulation and real-world indoor mock-disaster scenarios. On a 300-sample test set, the model achieves a mean squared error of 0.02 in pixel-space trajectory reconstruction. Real-world experiments demonstrate an overall mission success rate of 80% across accident-response and search-and-locate tasks with partial occlusions. These results indicate that human-conditioned diffusion planning offers a practical and robust solution for human-aware UAV navigation in time-critical assistance settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at HRI, Late Breaking Report, 2026</p></details> |
| **[MoE-Enhanced Multi-Domain Feature Selection and Fusion for Fast Map-Free Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02368v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for the reliability and safety of autonomous driving systems, yet it remains a challenging task in complex interactive scenarios due to noisy trajectory observations and intricate agent interactions. Existing methods often struggle to filter redundant scene data for discriminative information extraction, directly impairing trajectory prediction accuracy especially when handling outliers and dynamic multi-agent interactions. In response to these limitations, we present a novel map-free trajectory prediction method which adaptively eliminates redundant information and selects discriminative features across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains, thereby enabling precise trajectory prediction in real-world driving environments. First, we design a MoE based frequency domain filter to adaptively weight distinct frequency components of observed trajectory data and suppress outlier related noise; then a selective spatiotemporal attention module that reallocates weights across temporal nodes (sequential dependencies), temporal trends (evolution patterns), and spatial nodes to extract salient information is proposed. Finally, our multimodal decoder-supervised by joint patch level and point-level losses generates reasonable and temporally consistent trajectories, and comprehensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance and low-latency inference performance compared with recently proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[R$^2$PO: Decoupling Training Trajectories from Inference Responses for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11960v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has become a central paradigm for improving LLM reasoning. However, existing methods use a single policy to produce both inference responses and training optimization trajectories. The objective conflict between generating stable inference responses and diverse training trajectories leads to insufficient exploration, which harms reasoning capability. In this paper, to address the problem, we propose R$^2$PO (Residual Rollout Policy Optimization), which introduces a lightweight Residual Rollout-Head atop the policy to decouple training trajectories from inference responses, enabling controlled trajectory diversification during training while keeping inference generation stable. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms baselines, achieving average accuracy gains of 3.4% on MATH-500 and 1.3% on APPS, while also reducing formatting errors and mitigating length bias for stable optimization.

We extend this line of work to the social sciences by introducing a Transformer-based generative model tailored to longitudinal socio-economic data. Our contributions are: (i) we design a novel encoding method that represents socio-economic life histories as sequences, including overlapping events across life domains; and (ii) we adapt generative modelling techniques to simulate plausible alternative life trajectories conditioned on past histories. Using large-scale data from the Italian social security administration (INPS), we show that the model can be trained at scale, reproduces realistic labour market patterns consistent with known causal relationships, and generates coherent hypothetical life paths. This work demonstrates the feasibility of generative modelling for socio-economic trajectories and opens new opportunities for policy-oriented research, with counterfactual generation as a particularly promising application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emerging from Ground: Addressing Intent Deviation in Tool-Using Agents via Deriving Real Calls into Virtual Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15120v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have advanced tool-using agents for real-world applications, yet they often lead to unexpected behaviors or results. Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of "intent deviation" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a "Real-to-Virtual" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses. Integrating with training, RISE achieves an average 35.28% improvement in Acctask (task completion) and 23.27% in Accintent (intent alignment), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20--42.09% and 1.17--54.93% respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAD-TRO: Projection-Augmented Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04436v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have gained popularity and attention in trajectory optimization due to their capability of modeling multi-modal probability distributions. However, addressing nonlinear equality constraints, i.e, dynamic feasibility, remains a great challenge in diffusion-based trajectory optimization. Recent diffusion-based trajectory optimization frameworks rely on a single-shooting style approach where the denoised control sequence is applied to forward propagate the dynamical system, which cannot explicitly enforce constraints on the states and frequently leads to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we propose a novel direct trajectory optimization approach via model-based diffusion, which directly generates a sequence of states. To ensure dynamic feasibility, we propose a gradient-free projection mechanism that is incorporated into the reverse diffusion process. Our results show that, compared to a recent state-of-the-art baseline, our approach leads to zero dynamic feasibility error and approximately 4x higher success rate in a quadrotor waypoint navigation scenario involving dense static obstacles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2026 American Control Conference</p></details> |
| **[CLEANER: Self-Purified Trajectories Boost Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15141v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to utilize tools like Python interpreters for complex problem-solving. However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops. Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. Notably, CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, highlighting trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL.

| **[Context-aware Learned Mesh-based Simulation via Trajectory-Level Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05234v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating object deformations is a critical challenge across many scientific domains, including robotics, manufacturing, and structural mechanics. Learned Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer a promising alternative to traditional mesh-based physics simulators. Their speed and inherent differentiability make them particularly well suited for applications that require fast and accurate simulations, such as robotic manipulation or manufacturing optimization. However, existing learned simulators typically rely on single-step observations, which limits their ability to exploit temporal context. Without this information, these models fail to infer, e.g., material properties. Further, they rely on auto-regressive rollouts, which quickly accumulate error for long trajectories. We instead frame mesh-based simulation as a trajectory-level meta-learning problem. Using Conditional Neural Processes, our method enables rapid adaptation to new simulation scenarios from limited initial data while capturing their latent simulation properties. We utilize movement primitives to directly predict fast, stable and accurate simulations from a single model call. The resulting approach, Movement-primitive Meta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of the runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art GNSs across several tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages.

| **[Trajectory-Driven Multi-Product Influence Maximization in Billboard Advertising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14737v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Billboard Advertising has emerged as an effective out-of-home advertising technique, where the goal is to select a limited number of slots and play advertisement content there, with the hope that it will be observed by many people and, effectively, a significant number of them will be influenced towards the brand. Given a trajectory and a billboard database and a positive integer $k$, how can we select $k$ highly influential slots to maximize influence? In this paper, we study a variant of this problem where a commercial house wants to make a promotion of multiple products, and there is an influence demand for each product. We have studied two variants of the problem. In the first variant, our goal is to select $k$ slots such that the respective influence demand of each product is satisfied. In the other variant of the problem, we are given with $\ell$ integers $k_1,k_2, \ldots, k_{\ell}$, the goal here is to search for $\ell$ many set of slots $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_{\ell}$ such that for all $i \in [\ell]$, $|S_{i}| \leq k_i$ and for all $i \neq j$, $S_i \cap S_j=\emptyset$ and the influence demand of each of the products gets satisfied. We model the first variant of the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and the second variant as its generalization. To solve the common-slot variant, we formulate the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and design a bi-criteria approximation algorithm based on the continuous greedy framework and randomized rounding. For the disjoint-slot variant, we proposed a sampling-based approximation approach along with an efficient primal-dual greedy algorithm that enforces disjointness naturally. Extensive experiments with real-world trajectory and billboard datasets highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 Pa...</summary><p>31 Pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2510.09050</p></details> |

Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors. We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

A Simple Metric of Informative Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14249v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories provide rich supervision signals for distilling reasoning from teacher to student LLMs. However, both prior work and our experiments show that trajectories from stronger teachers do not necessarily yield better students, highlighting the importance of data-student suitability in distillation. Existing methods assess suitability primarily through student likelihood, favoring trajectories that closely align with the model's current behavior but overlooking more informative ones. Addressing this, we propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), a simple metric that captures both alignment and informativeness to assess the suitability of a reasoning trajectory. RSR is motivated by the observation that effective trajectories typically combine low absolute probability with relatively high-ranked tokens under the student model, balancing learning signal strength and behavioral alignment. Concretely, RSR is defined as the ratio of a trajectory's average token-wise rank to its average negative log-likelihood, and is straightforward to compute and interpret. Across five student models and reasoning trajectories from 11 diverse teachers, RSR strongly correlates with post-training performance (average Spearman 0.86), outperforming existing metrics. We further demonstrate its practical utility in both trajectory selection and teacher selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages.

A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03515v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations. Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably, WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving. Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without proper validation against independently collected data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Surrogate Models for Adaptive Aircraft Trajectory Prediction in En route Airspace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03075v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction (TP) is crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency in modern air traffic management systems. It is, for example, a core component of conflict detection and resolution tools, arrival sequencing algorithms, capacity planning, as well as several future concepts. However, TP accuracy within operational systems is hampered by a range of epistemic uncertainties such as the mass and performance settings of aircraft and the effect of meteorological conditions on aircraft performance. It can also require considerable computational resources. This paper proposes a method for adaptive TP that has two components: first, a fast surrogate TP model based on linear state space models (LSSM)s with an execution time that was 6.7 times lower on average than an implementation of the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) in Python. It is demonstrated that such models can effectively emulate the BADA aircraft performance model, which is based on the numerical solution of a partial differential equation (PDE), and that the LSSMs can be fitted to trajectories in a dataset of historic flight data. Secondly, the paper proposes an algorithm to assimilate radar observations using particle filtering to adaptively refine TP accuracy. Comparison with baselines using BADA and Kalman filtering demonstrate that the proposed framework improves system identification and state estimation for both climb and descent phases, with 46.3% and 64.7% better estimates for time to top of climb and bottom of descent compared to the best performing benchmark model. In particular, the particle filtering approach provides the flexibility to capture non-linear performance effects including the CAS-Mach transition.</p></details> |  |

Popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and inference-time reward aggregation are typically analyzed from a performance perspective, leaving their effects on the underlying reasoning distribution less understood. In this work, we study post-training reasoning from a stochastic trajectory viewpoint. Following Kim et al. (2025), we model reasoning steps of varying difficulty as Markov transitions with different probabilities, and formalize reasoning processes using tree-structured Markov chains. Within this framework, pretraining corresponds to discovering the reasoning structure, while post-training primarily reweights existing chains of thought. We show that both RLVR and inference-time reward aggregation concentrate probability mass on a small number of high-probability trajectories, leading to the suppression of rare but essential reasoning paths. As a consequence, solving hard instances often depends on low-probability trajectories already present in the base model. We further prove that exploration-oriented mechanisms, such as rejecting easy instances and applying KL regularization, help preserve these rare trajectories. Empirical simulations support our theoretical analysis.</p></details> |  |

Developing accurate prediction algorithms relies on reliable, multimodal, and realistic datasets; however, such datasets for roundabout scenarios are scarce, as real-world data collection is often limited by incomplete observations and entangled factors that are difficult to isolate. We present CARLA-Round, a systematically designed simulation dataset for roundabout trajectory prediction. The dataset varies weather conditions (five types) and traffic density levels (spanning Level-of-Service A-E) in a structured manner, resulting in 25 controlled scenarios. Each scenario incorporates realistic mixtures of driving behaviors and provides explicit annotations that are largely absent from existing datasets. Unlike randomly sampled simulation data, this structured design enables precise analysis of how different conditions influence trajectory prediction performance. Validation experiments using standard baselines (LSTM, GCN, GRU+GCN) reveal traffic density dominates prediction difficulty with strong monotonic effects, while weather shows non-linear impacts. The best model achieves 0.312m ADE on real-world rounD dataset, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer. This systematic approach quantifies factor impacts impossible to isolate in confounded real-world datasets.

Yet existing self-evolving frameworks mainly reward final outcomes, leaving intermediate reasoning weakly constrained despite its importance for visually grounded decision making. We propose iReasoner, a self-evolving framework that improves an LMM's implicit reasoning by explicitly eliciting chain-of-thought (CoT) and rewarding its internal agreement. In a Proposer--Solver loop over unlabeled images, iReasoner augments outcome-level intrinsic rewards with a trajectory-aware signal defined over intermediate reasoning steps, providing learning signals that distinguish reasoning paths leading to the same answer without ground-truth labels or external judges. Starting from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, iReasoner yields up to $+2.1$ points across diverse multimodal reasoning benchmarks under fully unsupervised post-training. We hope this work serves as a starting point for reasoning-aware self-improvement in LMMs in purely unsupervised settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attesting Model Lineage by Consisted Knowledge Evolution with Fine-Tuning Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11683v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fine-tuning technique in deep learning gives rise to an emerging lineage relationship among models. This lineage provides a promising perspective for addressing security concerns such as unauthorized model redistribution and false claim of model provenance, which are particularly pressing in \textcolor{blue}{open-weight model} libraries where robust lineage verification mechanisms are often lacking. Existing approaches to model lineage detection primarily rely on static architectural similarities, which are insufficient to capture the dynamic evolution of knowledge that underlies true lineage relationships. Drawing inspiration from the genetic mechanism of human evolution, we tackle the problem of model lineage attestation by verifying the joint trajectory of knowledge evolution and parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel model lineage attestation framework. In our framework, model editing is first leveraged to quantify parameter-level changes introduced by fine-tuning. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge vectorization mechanism that refines the evolved knowledge within the edited models into compact representations by the assistance of probe samples. The probing strategies are adapted to different types of model families. These embeddings serve as the foundation for verifying the arithmetic consistency of knowledge relationships across models, thereby enabling robust attestation of model lineage. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and resilience of our approach in a variety of adversarial scenarios in the real world. Our method consistently achieves reliable lineage verification across a broad spectrum of model types, including classifiers, diffusion models, and large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 35th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 2026)</p></details> |

However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

| **[Modeling mental health trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic using UK-wide data in the presence of sociodemographic variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10445v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: The negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and well-being of populations are an important public health issue. Our study aims to determine the underlying factors shaping mental health trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Methods: Data from the Understanding Society COVID-19 Study were utilized and the core analysis focussed on GHQ36 scores as the outcome variable. We used GAMs to evaluate trends over time and the role of sociodemographic variables, i.e., age, sex, ethnicity, country of residence (in UK), job status (employment), household income, living with a partner, living with children under age 16, and living with a long-term illness, on the variation of mental health during the study period. Results: Statistically significant differences in mental health were observed for age, sex,ethnicity, country of residence (in UK), job status (employment), household income, living with a partner, living with children under age 16, and living with a long-term illness. Women experienced higher GHQ36 scores relative to men with the GHQ36 score expected to increase by 1.260 (95%CI: 1.176, 1.345). Individuals living without a partner were expected to have higher GHQ36 scores, of 1.050 (95%CI: 0.949, 1.148) more than those living with a partner, and age groups 16-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64 experienced higher GHQ36 scores relative to those who were 65+. Individuals with relatively lower household income were likely to have poorer mental health relative to those who were more well off. Conclusion: This study identifies key demographic determinants shaping mental health trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Policies aiming to reduce mental health inequalities should target women, youth, individuals living without a partner, individuals living with children under 16, individuals with a long-term illness, and lower income families.</p></details> | 5 figures |

Current visual navigation methods are typically limited to simulated or off-street environments, and often rely on precise goal formats, such as specific coordinates or images. This limits their effectiveness for autonomous agents like last-mile delivery robots navigating unfamiliar cities. To address these limitations, we introduce UrbanNav, a scalable framework that trains embodied agents to follow free-form language instructions in diverse urban settings. Leveraging web-scale city walking videos, we develop an scalable annotation pipeline that aligns human navigation trajectories with language instructions grounded in real-world landmarks. UrbanNav encompasses over 1,500 hours of navigation data and 3 million instruction-trajectory-landmark triplets, capturing a wide range of urban scenarios. Our model learns robust navigation policies to tackle complex urban scenarios, demonstrating superior spatial reasoning, robustness to noisy instructions, and generalization to unseen urban settings. Experimental results show that UrbanNav significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the potential of large-scale web video data to enable language-guided, real-world urban navigation for embodied agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, accepted to AAAI 2026.

However, acquiring diverse and realistic multi-turn tool-use data remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel text-based paradigm. We observe that textual corpora naturally contain rich, multi-step problem-solving experiences, which can serve as an untapped, scalable, and authentic data source for multi-turn tool-use tasks. Based on this insight, we introduce GEM, a data synthesis pipeline that enables the generation and extraction of multi-turn tool-use trajectories from text corpora through a four-stage process: relevance filtering, workflow & tool extraction, trajectory grounding, and complexity refinement. To reduce the computational cost, we further train a specialized Trajectory Synthesizer via supervised fine-tuning. This model distills the complex generation pipeline into an efficient, end-to-end trajectory generator. Experiments demonstrate that our GEM-32B achieve a 16.5% improvement on the BFCL V3 Multi-turn benchmark. Our models partially surpass the performance of models trained on τ - bench (Airline and Retail) in-domain data, highlighting the superior generalization capability derived from our text-based synthesis paradigm. Notably, our Trajectory Synthesizer matches the quality of the full pipeline while significantly reducing inference latency and costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10348v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient distillation is a key pathway for converting expensive reasoning capability into deployable efficiency, yet in the frontier regime where the student already has strong reasoning ability, naive continual distillation often yields limited gains or even degradation. We observe a characteristic training phenomenon: even as loss decreases monotonically, all performance metrics can drop sharply at almost the same bottleneck, before gradually recovering. We further uncover a token-level mechanism: confidence bifurcates into steadily increasing Imitation-Anchor Tokens that quickly anchor optimization and other yet-to-learn tokens whose confidence is suppressed until after the bottleneck. And the characteristic that these two types of tokens cannot coexist is the root cause of the failure in continual distillation. To this end, we propose Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection (T3S) to reconstruct the training objective at the token level, clearing the optimization path for yet-to-learn tokens. T3 yields consistent gains in both AR and dLLM settings: with only hundreds of examples, Qwen3-8B surpasses DeepSeek-R1 on competitive reasoning benchmarks, Qwen3-32B approaches Qwen3-235B, and T3-trained LLaDA-2.0-Mini exceeds its AR baseline, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all of 16B-scale no-think models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep g-Pricing for CSI 300 Index Options with Volatility Trajectories and Market Sentiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18804v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Option pricing in real markets faces fundamental challenges. The Black--Scholes--Merton (BSM) model assumes constant volatility and uses a linear generator $g(t,x,y,z)=-ry$, while lacking explicit behavioral factors, resulting in systematic departures from observed dynamics. This paper extends the BSM model by learning a nonlinear generator within a deep Forward--Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE) framework. We propose a dual-network architecture where the value network $u_θ$ learns option prices and the generator network $g_φ$ characterizes the pricing mechanism, with the hedging strategy $Z_t=σ_t X_t \nabla_x u_θ$ obtained via automatic differentiation. The framework adopts forward recursion from a learnable initial condition $Y_0=u_θ(0,\cdot)$, naturally accommodating volatility trajectory and sentiment features. Empirical results on CSI 300 index options show that our method reduces Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 32.2\% and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by 35.3\% compared with BSM. Interpretability analysis indicates that architectural improvements are effective across all option types, while the information advantage is asymmetric between calls and puts. Specifically, call option improvements are primarily driven by sentiment features, whereas put options show more balanced contributions from volatility trajectory and sentiment features. This finding aligns with economic intuition regarding option pricing mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 10 tables.

With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReflexDiffusion: Reflection-Enhanced Trajectory Planning for High-lateral-acceleration Scenarios in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09377v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating safe and reliable trajectories for autonomous vehicles in long-tail scenarios remains a significant challenge, particularly for high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers such as sharp turns, which represent critical safety situations. Existing trajectory planners exhibit systematic failures in these scenarios due to data imbalance. This results in insufficient modelling of vehicle dynamics, road geometry, and environmental constraints in high-risk situations, leading to suboptimal or unsafe trajectory prediction when vehicles operate near their physical limits. In this paper, we introduce ReflexDiffusion, a novel inference-stage framework that enhances diffusion-based trajectory planners through reflective adjustment. Our method introduces a gradient-based adjustment mechanism during the iterative denoising process: after each standard trajectory update, we compute the gradient between the conditional and unconditional noise predictions to explicitly amplify critical conditioning signals, including road curvature and lateral vehicle dynamics. This amplification enforces strict adherence to physical constraints, particularly improving stability during high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers where precise vehicle-road interaction is paramount. Evaluated on the nuPlan Test14-hard benchmark, ReflexDiffusion achieves a 14.1% improvement in driving score for high-lateral-acceleration scenarios over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This demonstrates that inference-time trajectory optimization can effectively compensate for training data sparsity by dynamically reinforcing safety-critical constraints near handling limits. The framework's architecture-agnostic design enables direct deployment to existing diffusion-based planners, offering a practical solution for improving autonomous vehicle safety in challenging driving conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Trajectory Optimization for Arbitrary-Shaped Mobile Robots via Polynomial Separating Hypersurfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09231v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An emerging class of trajectory optimization methods enforces collision avoidance by jointly optimizing the robot's configuration and a separating hyperplane. However, as linear separators only apply to convex sets, these methods require convex approximations of both the robot and obstacles, which becomes an overly conservative assumption in cluttered and narrow environments. In this work, we unequivocally remove this limitation by introducing nonlinear separating hypersurfaces parameterized by polynomial functions. We first generalize the classical separating hyperplane theorem and prove that any two disjoint bounded closed sets in Euclidean space can be separated by a polynomial hypersurface, serving as the theoretical foundation for nonlinear separation of arbitrary geometries. Building on this result, we formulate a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem that jointly optimizes the robot's trajectory and the coefficients of the separating polynomials, enabling geometry-aware collision avoidance without conservative convex simplifications. The optimization remains efficiently solvable using standard NLP solvers. Simulation and real-world experiments with nonconvex robots demonstrate that our method achieves smooth, collision-free, and agile maneuvers in environments where convex-approximation baselines fail.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods for map matching are generally based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or encoder-decoder framework. However, these methods continue to face significant challenges when handling noisy or sparsely sampled GPS trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose DiffMM, an encoder-diffusion-based map matching framework that produces effective yet efficient matching results through a one-step diffusion process. We first introduce a road segment-aware trajectory encoder that jointly embeds the input trajectory and its surrounding candidate road segments into a shared latent space through an attention mechanism. Next, we propose a one step diffusion method to realize map matching through a shortcut model by leveraging the joint embedding of the trajectory and candidate road segments as conditioning context. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art map matching methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, particularly for sparse trajectories and complex road network topologies.</p></details> | AAAI-26 |

Repeated sampling over the same input often produces divergent reasoning trajectories and inconsistent final predictions. To address this, we introduce two complementary approaches inspired by test-time scaling: (1) CASHEW, an inference-time framework that stabilizes reasoning by iteratively aggregating multiple candidate trajectories into higher-quality reasoning traces, with explicit visual verification filtering hallucinated steps and grounding reasoning in visual evidence, and (2) CASHEW-RL, a learned variant that internalizes this aggregation behavior within a single model. CASHEW-RL is trained using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) with a composite reward that encourages correct answers grounded in minimal yet sufficient visual evidence, while adaptively allocating reasoning effort based on task difficulty. This training objective enables robust self-aggregation at inference. Extensive experiments on 13 image understanding, video understanding, and video reasoning benchmarks show significant performance improvements, including gains of up to +23.6 percentage points on ScienceQA and +8.1 percentage points on EgoSchema.</p></details> |  |
| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v4)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[PsyCLIENT: Client Simulation via Conversational Trajectory Modeling for Trainee Practice and Model Evaluation in Mental Health Counseling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07312v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based client simulation has emerged as a promising tool for training novice counselors and evaluating automated counseling systems. However, existing client simulation approaches face three key challenges: (1) limited diversity and realism in client profiles, (2) the lack of a principled framework for modeling realistic client behaviors, and (3) a scarcity in Chinese-language settings. To address these limitations, we propose PsyCLIENT, a novel simulation framework grounded in conversational trajectory modeling. By conditioning LLM generation on predefined real-world trajectories that incorporate explicit behavior labels and content constraints, our approach ensures diverse and realistic interactions. We further introduce PsyCLIENT-CP, the first open-source Chinese client profile dataset, covering 60 distinct counseling topics. Comprehensive evaluations involving licensed professional counselors demonstrate that PsyCLIENT significantly outperforms baselines in terms of authenticity and training effectiveness. Notably, the simulated clients are nearly indistinguishable from human clients, achieving an about 95\% expert confusion rate in discrimination tasks. These findings indicate that conversational trajectory modeling effectively bridges the gap between theoretical client profiles and dynamic, realistic simulations, offering a robust solution for mental health education and research. Code and data will be released to facilitate future research in mental health counseling.</p></details> |  |

Existing imputation methods emphasize trajectory recovery, paying limited attention to interpretability and failing to provide underlying knowledge that benefits downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and route planning. We propose knowledge-driven interpretable vessel trajectory imputation (VISTA), the first trajectory imputation framework that offers interpretability while simultaneously providing underlying knowledge to support downstream analysis. Specifically, we first define underlying knowledge as a combination of Structured Data-derived Knowledge (SDK) distilled from AIS data and Implicit LLM Knowledge acquired from large-scale Internet corpora. Second, to manage and leverage the SDK effectively at scale, we develop a data-knowledge-data loop that employs a Structured Data-derived Knowledge Graph for SDK extraction and knowledge-driven trajectory imputation. Third, to efficiently process large-scale AIS data, we introduce a workflow management layer that coordinates the end-to-end pipeline, enabling parallel knowledge extraction and trajectory imputation with anomaly handling and redundancy elimination. Experiments on two large AIS datasets show that VISTA is capable of state-of-the-art imputation accuracy and computational efficiency, improving over state-of-the-art baselines by 5%-94% and reducing time cost by 51%-93%, while producing interpretable knowledge cues that benefit downstream tasks.

| **[Mobility Trajectories from Network-Driven Markov Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06020v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a generative model of human mobility in which trajectories arise as realizations of a prescribed, time-dependent Markov dynamics defined on a spatial interaction network. The model constructs a hierarchical routing structure with hubs, corridors, feeder paths, and metro links, and specifies transition matrices using gravity-type distance decay combined with externally imposed temporal schedules and directional biases. Population mass evolves as indistinguishable, memoryless movers performing a single transition per time step. When aggregated, the resulting trajectories reproduce structured origin-destination flows that reflect network geometry, temporal modulation, and connectivity constraints. By applying the Perron-Frobenius theorem to the daily evolution operator, we identify a unique periodic invariant population distribution that serves as a natural non-transient reference state. We verify consistency between trajectory-level realizations and multi-step Markov dynamics, showing that discrepancies are entirely attributable to finite-population sampling. The framework provides a network-centric, privacy-preserving approach to generating mobility trajectories and studying time-elapsed flow structure without invoking individual-level behavioral assumptions.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

This pattern is also often observed within-seasons, as an athlete aims for their performance to peak at key events such as the Olympic Games or World Championships. A Bayesian hierarchical model is developed to analyse the evolution of athletic sporting performance throughout an athlete's career and separate these effects whilst allowing for confounding factors such as environmental conditions. Our model works in continuous time and estimates both $g(t)$, the average performance level of the population at age $t$, and $f_i(t)$, the difference of the $i$-th athlete from this average. We further decompose $f_i(t)$ into a season-to-season trajectory and a within-season trajectory, which is modelled by a restricted Bernstein polynomial. The model is fitted using an adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm with a carefully chosen blocking scheme. The model allows us to understand seasonal patterns in athlete performance, how these differ between athletes, and provides individual fitted and trend performance trajectories. The properties of the model are illustrated using a simulation study and an application to 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle swimming for both female and male athletes.</p></details> |  |

However, we find that directly applying these techniques to image-to-video (I2V) models often fails to yield consistent reward improvements. To address this limitation, we present TAGRPO, a robust post-training framework for I2V models inspired by contrastive learning. Our approach is grounded in the observation that rollout videos generated from identical initial noise provide superior guidance for optimization. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel GRPO loss applied to intermediate latents, encouraging direct alignment with high-reward trajectories while maximizing distance from low-reward counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a memory bank for rollout videos to enhance diversity and reduce computational overhead. Despite its simplicity, TAGRPO achieves significant improvements over DanceGRPO in I2V generation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Here we analyzed 97,564 longitudinal PASC assessments from 13,511 participants with linked vaccination histories to disentangle passive temporal progression from vaccine-associated change. Using a clinically validated threshold (PASC $\geq 12$), trajectories separated into three phenotypes: Protected (persistently sub-threshold), Refractory (persistently symptomatic), and Responders (transitioning from symptomatic to recovered). Across the full cohort, symptom severity increased modestly with elapsed time ($r=0.0521$, $P=1.26\times10^{-59}$), whereas cumulative vaccination showed an inverse association with severity ($r=-0.0434$, $P=5.95\times10^{-42}$). In summary, baseline Long COVID severity appears clinically deterministic. In the absence of intervention, symptoms typically persist without spontaneous resolution. Recovery is primarily associated with repeated immunization.</p></details> |  |

Despite performance improvements from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), current models lack a mechanism to trace how small targets trigger directional, layer-wise perturbations in the feature space, which is an essential cue for distinguishing signal from structured noise in infrared scenes. To address this limitation, we propose the Trajectory-Aware Mamba Propagation Network (TAPM-Net), which explicitly models the spatial diffusion behavior of target-induced feature disturbances. TAPM-Net is built upon two novel components: a Perturbation-guided Path Module (PGM) and a Trajectory-Aware State Block (TASB). The PGM constructs perturbation energy fields from multi-level features and extracts gradient-following feature trajectories that reflect the directionality of local responses. The resulting feature trajectories are fed into the TASB, a Mamba-based state-space unit that models dynamic propagation along each trajectory while incorporating velocity-constrained diffusion and semantically aligned feature fusion from word-level and sentence-level embeddings. Unlike existing attention-based methods, TAPM-Net enables anisotropic, context-sensitive state transitions along spatial trajectories while maintaining global coherence at low computational cost. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1K demonstrate that TAPM-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in ISTD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in BMVC 2025 see: https://bmva-archive.org.uk/bmvc/2025/assets/papers/Paper_709/paper.pdf.

We aim to endow computational systems with a similar ability to predict plausible future object motions directly from passive visual observation. We introduce ObjectForesight, a 3D object-centric dynamics model that predicts future 6-DoF poses and trajectories of rigid objects from short egocentric video sequences. Unlike conventional world or dynamics models that operate in pixel or latent space, ObjectForesight represents the world explicitly in 3D at the object level, enabling geometrically grounded and temporally coherent predictions that capture object affordances and trajectories. To train such a model at scale, we leverage recent advances in segmentation, mesh reconstruction, and 3D pose estimation to curate a dataset of 2 million plus short clips with pseudo-ground-truth 3D object trajectories.

Remote assistance concepts, where operators provide discrete inputs to aid specific automation modules like planning, is gaining interest due to its reduced workload on the human remote operator and improved safety. However, these concepts are challenging to implement and maintain due to their deep integration and interaction with the automated driving system. In this paper, we propose a solution to facilitate the implementation of remote assistance concepts that intervene on planning level and extend the operational design domain of the vehicle at runtime. Using arbitration graphs, a modular decision-making framework, we integrate remote assistance into an existing automated driving system without modifying the original software components. Our simulative implementation demonstrates this approach in two use cases, allowing operators to adjust planner constraints and enable trajectory generation beyond nominal operational design domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, presented at IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium 2025, video demonstration available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVSO-YOeGMk</p></details> |
| **[EntroLnn: Entropy-Guided Liquid Neural Networks for Operando Refinement of Battery Capacity Fade Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06195v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Battery capacity degradation prediction has long been a central topic in battery health analytics, and most studies focus on state of health (SoH) estimation and end of life (EoL) prediction. This study extends the scope to online refinement of the entire capacity fade trajectory (CFT) through EntroLnn, a framework based on entropy-guided transformable liquid neural networks (LNNs). EntroLnn treats CFT refinement as an integrated process rather than two independent tasks for pointwise SoH and EoL. We introduce entropy-based features derived from online temperature fields, applied for the first time in battery analytics, and combine them with customized LNNs that model temporal battery dynamics effectively. The framework enhances both static and dynamic adaptability of LNNs and achieves robust and generalizable CFT refinement across different batteries and operating conditions. The approach provides a high fidelity battery health model with lightweight computation, achieving mean absolute errors of only 0.004577 for CFT and 18 cycles for EoL prediction. This work establishes a foundation for entropy-informed learning in battery analytics and enables self-adaptive, lightweight, and interpretable battery health prediction in practical battery management systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Exploring Similarity between Neural and LLM Trajectories in Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24307v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the similarity between large language models (LLMs) and human brain activity is crucial for advancing both AI and cognitive neuroscience. In this study, we provide a multilinguistic, large-scale assessment of this similarity by systematically comparing 16 publicly available pretrained LLMs with human brain responses during natural language processing tasks in both English and Chinese. Specifically, we use ridge regression to assess the representational similarity between LLM embeddings and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and analyze the similarity between the "neural trajectory" and the "LLM latent trajectory." This method captures key dynamic patterns, such as magnitude, angle, uncertainty, and confidence. Our findings highlight both similarities and crucial differences in processing strategies: (1) We show that middle-to-high layers of LLMs are central to semantic integration and correspond to the N400 component observed in EEG; (2) The brain exhibits continuous and iterative processing during reading, whereas LLMs often show discrete, stage-end bursts of activity, which suggests a stark contrast in their real-time semantic processing dynamics. This study could offer new insights into LLMs and neural processing, and also establish a critical framework for future investigations into the alignment between artificial intelligence and biological intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[PILOT: Planning via Internalized Latent Optimization Trajectories for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19917v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strategic planning is critical for multi-step reasoning, yet compact Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the capacity to formulate global strategies, leading to error propagation in long-horizon tasks. Our analysis reveals that LLMs possess latent reasoning capabilities that can be unlocked when conditioned on explicit plans from a teacher model; however, runtime reliance on external guidance is often impractical due to latency and availability constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose PILOT (Planning via Internalized Latent Optimization Trajectories), a non-invasive framework designed to internalize the strategic oversight of large models into intrinsic Latent Guidance. Instead of altering backbone weights, PILOT employs a lightweight Hyper-Network to synthesize a query-conditioned Latent Guidance vector. This vector acts as an internal steering mechanism, guiding the model's representations toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on mathematical and coding benchmarks demonstrate that PILOT effectively stabilizes reasoning trajectories, consistently outperforming strong baselines (e.g., +8.9% on MATH500) with negligible inference latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Table Pruning in TableQA: From Sequential Revisions to Gold Trajectory-Supervised Parallel Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03851v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Table Question Answering (TableQA) benefits significantly from table pruning, which extracts compact sub-tables by eliminating redundant cells to streamline downstream reasoning. However, existing pruning methods typically rely on sequential revisions driven by unreliable critique signals, often failing to detect the loss of answer-critical data. To address this limitation, we propose TabTrim, a novel table pruning framework which transforms table pruning from sequential revisions to gold trajectory-supervised parallel search. TabTrim derives a gold pruning trajectory using the intermediate sub-tables in the execution process of gold SQL queries, and trains a pruner and a verifier to make the step-wise pruning result align with the gold pruning trajectory. During inference, TabTrim performs parallel search to explore multiple candidate pruning trajectories and identify the optimal sub-table. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TabTrim achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tabular reasoning tasks: TabTrim-8B reaches 73.5% average accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.2%, including 79.4% on WikiTQ and 61.2% on TableBench.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

Starting with a small number of embodiment-flexible human demonstrations collected in a virtual reality simulation environment, the pipeline refines these demonstrations using optimization-based kinematic retargeting and trajectory optimization to adapt them across various robot embodiments and physical parameters. This process yields a diverse, physically consistent dataset that enables cross-embodiment data transfer, and offers the potential to reuse legacy datasets collected under different hardware configurations or physical parameters. We validate the pipeline's effectiveness by training diffusion policies from the generated datasets for challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks across multiple robot embodiments, including a floating Allegro hand and bimanual robot arms. The trained policies are deployed zero-shot on hardware for bimanual iiwa arms, achieving high success rates with minimal human input.

While text-based affect inference has become increasingly feasible, prior approaches often treat sentiment as a deterministic point estimate for individual speakers, failing to capture the inherent subjectivity, latent ambiguity, and sequential coupling found in mutual exchanges. We introduce LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework that characterizes emotion not as a static label, but as a continuous latent probability distribution defined over an affective space. By leveraging stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation, the methodology approximates these distributions to derive high-fidelity sentiment trajectories that explicitly quantify both central affective tendencies and perceptual ambiguity. These trajectories enable a structured analysis of interpersonal coupling through sequential cross-correlation and slope-based indicators, identifying leading or lagging influences between interlocutors. To validate the interpretive capacity of this approach, we utilize teacher-student instructional dialogues as a representative case study, where our quantitative indicators successfully distill high-level interaction insights such as effective scaffolding. This work establishes a scalable and deployable pathway for understanding interpersonal dynamics, offering a generalizable solution that extends beyond education to broader social and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Continuous-Time Trajectory Estimation via Gaussian Processes and the Magnus Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03360v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous-time state estimation has been shown to be an effective means of (i) handling asynchronous and high-rate measurements, (ii) introducing smoothness to the estimate, (iii) post hoc querying the estimate at times other than those of the measurements, and (iv) addressing certain observability issues related to scanning-while-moving sensors. A popular means of representing the trajectory in continuous time is via a Gaussian process (GP) prior, with the prior's mean and covariance functions generated by a linear time-varying (LTV) stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by white noise. When the state comprises elements of Lie groups, previous works have resorted to a patchwork of local GPs each with a linear time-invariant SDE kernel, which while effective in practice, lacks theoretical elegance. Here we revisit the full LTV GP approach to continuous-time trajectory estimation, deriving a global GP prior on Lie groups via the Magnus expansion, which offers a more elegant and general solution. We provide a numerical comparison between the two approaches and discuss their relative merits.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Dual-quaternion learning control for autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking with safety guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03097v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a learning-based trajectory tracking controller for autonomous robotic platforms whose motion can be described kinematically on $\mathrm{SE}(3)$. The controller is formulated in the dual quaternion framework and operates at the velocity level, assuming direct command of angular and linear velocities, as is standard in many aerial vehicles and omnidirectional mobile robots. Gaussian Process (GP) regression is integrated into a geometric feedback law to learn and compensate online for unknown, state-dependent disturbances and modeling imperfections affecting both attitude and position, while preserving the algebraic structure and coupling properties inherent to rigid-body motion. The proposed approach does not rely on explicit parametric models of the unknown effects, making it well-suited for robotic systems subject to sensor-induced disturbances, unmodeled actuation couplings, and environmental uncertainties. A Lyapunov-based analysis establishes probabilistic ultimate boundedness of the pose tracking error under bounded GP uncertainty, providing formal stability guarantees for the learning-based controller. Simulation results demonstrate accurate and smooth trajectory tracking in the presence of realistic, localized disturbances, including correlated rotational and translational effects arising from magnetometer perturbations. These results illustrate the potential of combining geometric modeling and probabilistic learning to achieve robust, data-efficient pose control for autonomous robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Action: Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09990v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation; reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Swept Volume-Based Trajectory Generation for Arbitrary-Shaped Ground Robot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07554v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating an arbitrary-shaped ground robot safely in cluttered environments remains a challenging problem. The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-Regularized Generative Auto-Bidding: From Suboptimal Trajectories to Optimal Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02754v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of e-commerce, auto-bidding has become a key asset in optimizing advertising performance under diverse advertiser environments. The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning. To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.</p></details> | <details><summary>11pag...</summary><p>11pages, 5figures, In Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining</p></details> |

However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

However, realizing these benefits in practice is non-trivial, as dLLMs inherently face an accuracy-parallelism trade-off. Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/d3LLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Guided Diffusion for Foreground-Preserving Background Generation in Multi-Layer Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21857v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a diffusion-based framework for document-centric background generation that achieves foreground preservation and multi-page stylistic consistency through latent-space design rather than explicit constraints. Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents. By reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, we offer a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling.</p></details> | 47 pages, 36 figures |
| **[SKETCH: Semantic Key-Point Conditioning for Long-Horizon Vessel Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18537v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate long-horizon vessel trajectory prediction remains challenging due to compounded uncertainty from complex navigation behaviors and environmental factors. Existing methods often struggle to maintain global directional consistency, leading to drifting or implausible trajectories when extrapolated over long time horizons. To address this issue, we propose a semantic-key-point-conditioned trajectory modeling framework, in which future trajectories are predicted by conditioning on a high-level Next Key Point (NKP) that captures navigational intent. This formulation decomposes long-horizon prediction into global semantic decision-making and local motion modeling, effectively restricting the support of future trajectories to semantically feasible subsets. To efficiently estimate the NKP prior from historical observations, we adopt a pretrain-finetune strategy. Extensive experiments on real-world AIS data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly for long travel durations, directional accuracy, and fine-grained trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASTRA: Automated Synthesis of agentic Trajectories and Reinforcement Arenas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21558v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as tool-augmented agents for multi-step decision making, yet training robust tool-using agents remains challenging. Existing methods still require manual intervention, depend on non-verifiable simulated environments, rely exclusively on either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), and struggle with stable long-horizon, multi-turn learning. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRA, a fully automated end-to-end framework for training tool-augmented language model agents via scalable data synthesis and verifiable reinforcement learning. ASTRA integrates two complementary components. First, a pipeline that leverages the static topology of tool-call graphs synthesizes diverse, structurally grounded trajectories, instilling broad and transferable tool-use competence. Second, an environment synthesis framework that captures the rich, compositional topology of human semantic reasoning converts decomposed question-answer traces into independent, code-executable, and rule-verifiable environments, enabling deterministic multi-turn RL. Based on this method, we develop a unified training methodology that integrates SFT with online RL using trajectory-level rewards to balance task completion and interaction efficiency. Experiments on multiple agentic tool-use benchmarks demonstrate that ASTRA-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales, approaching closed-source systems while preserving core reasoning ability. We release the full pipelines, environments, and trained models at https://github.com/LianjiaTech/astra.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios: weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance, which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative models for interactive systems. https://guillem-cf.github.io/JointDiff/</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

For example, a vehicle's dynamics evolve gradually through a turning maneuver, and human gait shifts smoothly from walking to running. We formalize this setting by modeling transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finitely many atomic mechanisms, governed by time-varying mixing coefficients. Our theoretical contributions establish that both the latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are jointly identifiable. We further propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework where each expert learns one atomic mechanism during training, enabling recovery of mechanism trajectories at test time. This formulation generalizes to intermediate mechanism states never observed during training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that TRACE recovers mixing trajectories with up to 0.99 correlation, substantially outperforming discrete-switching baselines.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Track-centric Iterative Learning for Global Trajectory Optimization in Autonomous Racing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21027v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a global trajectory optimization framework for minimizing lap time in autonomous racing under uncertain vehicle dynamics. Optimizing the trajectory over the full racing horizon is computationally expensive, and tracking such a trajectory in the real world hardly assures global optimality due to uncertain dynamics. Yet, existing work mostly focuses on dynamics learning at the tracking level, without updating the trajectory itself to account for the learned dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a track-centric approach that directly learns and optimizes the full-horizon trajectory. We first represent trajectories through a track-agnostic parametric space in light of the wavelet transform. This space is then efficiently explored using Bayesian optimization, where the lap time of each candidate is evaluated by running simulations with the learned dynamics. This optimization is embedded in an iterative learning framework, where the optimized trajectory is deployed to collect real-world data for updating the dynamics, progressively refining the trajectory over the iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating lap time improvement of up to 20.7% over a nominal baseline and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Modular pipelines restrict information flow and can amplify upstream errors. Recent query-based, fully differentiable perception-and-prediction (PnP) models mitigate these issues, yet the complementarity of cameras and LiDAR in the query-space has not been sufficiently explored. Models often rely on fusion schemes that introduce heuristic alignment and discrete selection steps which prevent full utilization of available information and can introduce unwanted bias. We propose Li-ViP3D++, a query-based multimodal PnP framework that introduces Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to integrate multi-view RGB and LiDAR in query space. QGDF (i) aggregates image evidence via masked attention across cameras and feature levels, (ii) extracts LiDAR context through fully differentiable BEV sampling with learned per-query offsets, and (iii) applies query-conditioned gating to adaptively weight visual and geometric cues per agent. The resulting architecture jointly optimizes detection, tracking, and multi-hypothesis trajectory forecasting in a single end-to-end model. On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ improves end-to-end behavior and detection quality, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502) while substantially reducing false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and it is faster than the prior Li-ViP3D variant (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms). These results indicate that query-space, fully differentiable camera-LiDAR fusion can increase robustness of end-to-end PnP without sacrificing deployability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This paper presents a scalable alternative: high-accuracy whole-body touch localization via vibro-acoustic sensing. By equipping a robotic hand with seven low-cost piezoelectric microphones and leveraging an Audio Spectrogram Transformer, we decode the vibrational signatures generated during physical interaction. Extensive evaluation across stationary and dynamic tasks reveals a localization error of under 5 mm in static conditions. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the distinct influence of material properties: stiff materials (e.g., metal) excel in impulse response localization due to sharp, high-bandwidth responses, whereas textured materials (e.g., wood) provide superior friction-based features for trajectory tracking. The system demonstrates robustness to the robot's own motion, maintaining effective tracking even during active operation. Our primary contribution is demonstrating that complex physical contact dynamics can be effectively decoded from simple vibrational signals, offering a viable pathway to widespread, affordable contact perception in robotics. To accelerate research, we provide our full datasets, models, and experimental setups as open-source resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review: Springer Autonomous Robots Journal</p></details> |

We argue that current evaluation paradigms suffer from an unanchored defect, leading to two forms of instability: process drift, where unsteered client simulation wanders away from specific counseling goals, and standard drift, where static pointwise scoring lacks the stability for reliable judgment. To address this, we introduce Ps, a unified framework that calibrates the therapeutic competence of LLMs via trajectory-anchored tournaments. We first anchor the interaction trajectory in simulation, where clients precisely control the fluid consultation process to probe multifaceted capabilities. We then anchor the battle trajectory in judgments through an efficient Swiss-system tournament, utilizing dynamic pairwise battles to yield robust Elo ratings. Beyond ranking, we demonstrate that tournament trajectories can be transformed into credible reward signals, enabling on-policy reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PsychePass and its strong consistency with human expert judgments.</p></details> |  |

Learning-based MAPF solvers offer fast and scalable planning but often produce feasible trajectories that contain unnecessary or oscillatory movements. We propose Judgelight, a post-optimization layer that improves trajectory quality after a MAPF solver generates a feasible schedule. Judgelight collapses closed subwalks in agents' trajectories to remove redundant movements while preserving all feasibility constraints. We formalize this process as MAPF-Collapse, prove that it is NP-hard, and present an exact optimization approach by formulating it as integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Experimental results show Judgelight consistently reduces solution cost by around 20%, particularly for learning-based solvers, producing trajectories that are better suited for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Out-of-Distribution Generalization via Invariant Trajectories for Multimodal Large Language Model Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19700v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.</p></details> |  |

To this end, a deep autoencoder (DAE) model is employed to infer the ID in the weakly nonlinear regime ($β\lesssim 1$). We find that the trajectories lie on a nonlinear manifold of dimension $m^{\ast} = 2$ embedded in a $64$-dimensional phase space. The DAE further reveals that this dimensionality increases to $m^{\ast} = 3$ at $β= 1.1$, coinciding with a symmetry breaking transition, in which additional energy modes with even wave numbers $k = 2, 4$ become excited. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the linear approach based on principal component analysis (PCA), which fails to capture the underlying structure of the data and therefore yields unreliable results in most cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures.

Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDF) enable fixed-base manipulators to model collisions directly in configuration space via smooth, implicit distances. This representation holds strong potential to bypass the nonlinear configuration-to-workspace mapping while preserving accurate whole-body geometry and providing optimization-friendly collision costs. Yet, extending this capability to mobile manipulators is hindered by unbounded workspaces and tighter base-arm coupling. We lift this promise to mobile manipulation with Generalized Configuration Space Distance Fields (GCDF), extending CDF to robots with both translational and rotational joints in unbounded workspaces with tighter base-arm coupling. We prove that GCDF preserves Euclidean-like local distance structure and accurately encodes whole-body geometry in configuration space, and develop a data generation and training pipeline that yields continuous neural GCDFs with accurate values and gradients, supporting efficient GPU-batched queries. Building on this representation, we develop a high-performance sequential convex optimization framework centered on GCDF-based collision reasoning. The solver scales to large numbers of implicit constraints through (i) online specification of neural constraints, (ii) sparsity-aware active-set detection with parallel batched evaluation across thousands of constraints, and (iii) incremental constraint management for rapid replanning under scene changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Video Generation for Robotic Manipulation with Collaborative Trajectory Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01943v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video diffusion models shows promise for generating robotic decision-making data, with trajectory conditions further enabling fine-grained control. However, existing methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex manipulation. This limitation arises from entangled features in overlapping regions, leading to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics via a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction, and models each phase using the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction. This design effectively alleviates the multi-object feature fusion issue in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency across the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge dataset, as well as RLBench and SIMPLER benchmarks, demonstrate that our method establishs new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.

| **[Generative Chain of Behavior for User Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18213v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling long-term user behavior trajectories is essential for understanding evolving preferences and enabling proactive recommendations. However, most sequential recommenders focus on next-item prediction, overlooking dependencies across multiple future actions. We propose Generative Chain of Behavior (GCB), a generative framework that models user interactions as an autoregressive chain of semantic behaviors over multiple future steps. GCB first encodes items into semantic IDs via RQ-VAE with k-means refinement, forming a discrete latent space that preserves semantic proximity. On top of this space, a transformer-based autoregressive generator predicts multi-step future behaviors conditioned on user history, capturing long-horizon intent transitions and generating coherent trajectories. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that GCB consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommenders in multi-step accuracy and trajectory consistency. Beyond these gains, GCB offers a unified generative formulation for capturing user preference evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Refusal Circuits Across LLMs: Cross-Model Transfer via Trajectory Replay and Concept-Basis Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16034v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refusal behavior in aligned LLMs is often viewed as model-specific, yet we hypothesize it stems from a universal, low-dimensional semantic circuit shared across models. To test this, we introduce Trajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction, a framework that transfers refusal interventions from donor to target models, spanning diverse architectures (e.g., Dense to MoE) and training regimes, without using target-side refusal supervision. By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space. To preserve capabilities, we introduce a weight-SVD stability guard that projects interventions away from high-variance weight subspaces to prevent collateral damage. Our evaluation across 8 model pairs confirms that these transferred recipes consistently attenuate refusal while maintaining performance, providing strong evidence for the semantic universality of safety alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Trajectory Representation Learning for Travel Time Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05840v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, traditional approaches typically convert trajectory data into fixed-length representations. This overlooks the inherent variability of real-world motion patterns, often resulting in information loss and redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance the performance of TTE. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a multimodal fusion module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics, while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong generalization abilities. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/City-Computing/MDTI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Reasoning Trajectories for Hallucination Detection via Answer-agreement Representation Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17467v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) often generate long, seemingly coherent reasoning traces yet still produce incorrect answers, making hallucination detection challenging. Although trajectories contain useful signals, directly using trace text or vanilla hidden states for detection is brittle: traces vary in form and detectors can overfit to superficial patterns rather than answer validity. We introduce Answer-agreement Representation Shaping (ARS), which learns detection-friendly trace-conditioned representations by explicitly encoding answer stability. ARS generates counterfactual answers through small latent interventions, specifically, perturbing the trace-boundary embedding, and labels each perturbation by whether the resulting answer agrees with the original. It then learns representations that bring answer-agreeing states together and separate answer-disagreeing ones, exposing latent instability indicative of hallucination risk. The shaped embeddings are plug-and-play with existing embedding-based detectors and require no human annotations during training. Experiments demonstrate that ARS consistently improves detection and achieves substantial gains over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches focus on single learning experiences and do not account for students' gradual knowledge construction and evolving skill sets. Moreover, large language models are optimized to produce direct and accurate responses, making it challenging to represent the incomplete understanding and developmental constraints that characterize real learners. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for memory-based student simulation that incorporates developmental trajectories through a hierarchical memory mechanism with structured knowledge representation. The framework also integrates metacognitive processes and personality traits to enrich the individual learner profiling, through dynamical consolidation of both cognitive development and personal learning characteristics. In practice, we implement a curriculum-aligned simulator grounded on the Next Generation Science Standards. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively reflect the gradual nature of knowledge development and the characteristic difficulties students face, providing a more accurate representation of learning processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed some grammar and format issues.

Graph-based solvers provide global guarantees but assume pre-selected measurement locations, while continuous trajectory optimization supports path-based sensing but is computationally intensive and sensitive to initialization in obstacle-dense settings. We propose a hierarchical framework with three stages: (i) graph-based global planning, (ii) segment-wise budget allocation using geometric and kernel bounds, and (iii) spline-based refinement of each segment with hard constraints and obstacle pruning. By combining global guidance with local refinement, our method achieves lower posterior uncertainty than graph-only and continuous baselines, while running faster than continuous-space solvers (up to 9x faster than gradient-based methods and 20x faster than black-box optimizers) across synthetic cluttered environments and Arctic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Trajectory Alignment Coefficient in Two Acts: From Reward Tuning to Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16906v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of reinforcement learning (RL) is fundamentally tied to having a reward function that accurately reflects the task objective. Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents HumanDiffusion, a lightweight image-conditioned diffusion planner that generates human-aware navigation trajectories directly from RGB imagery. The system combines YOLO-11 based human detection with diffusion-driven trajectory generation, enabling a quadrotor to approach a target person and deliver medical assistance without relying on prior maps or computationally intensive planning pipelines. Trajectories are predicted in pixel space, ensuring smooth motion and a consistent safety margin around humans. We evaluate HumanDiffusion in simulation and real-world indoor mock-disaster scenarios. On a 300-sample test set, the model achieves a mean squared error of 0.02 in pixel-space trajectory reconstruction. Real-world experiments demonstrate an overall mission success rate of 80% across accident-response and search-and-locate tasks with partial occlusions. These results indicate that human-conditioned diffusion planning offers a practical and robust solution for human-aware UAV navigation in time-critical assistance settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at HRI, Late Breaking Report, 2026</p></details> |
| **[MoE-Enhanced Multi-Domain Feature Selection and Fusion for Fast Map-Free Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02368v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for the reliability and safety of autonomous driving systems, yet it remains a challenging task in complex interactive scenarios due to noisy trajectory observations and intricate agent interactions. Existing methods often struggle to filter redundant scene data for discriminative information extraction, directly impairing trajectory prediction accuracy especially when handling outliers and dynamic multi-agent interactions. In response to these limitations, we present a novel map-free trajectory prediction method which adaptively eliminates redundant information and selects discriminative features across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains, thereby enabling precise trajectory prediction in real-world driving environments. First, we design a MoE based frequency domain filter to adaptively weight distinct frequency components of observed trajectory data and suppress outlier related noise; then a selective spatiotemporal attention module that reallocates weights across temporal nodes (sequential dependencies), temporal trends (evolution patterns), and spatial nodes to extract salient information is proposed. Finally, our multimodal decoder-supervised by joint patch level and point-level losses generates reasonable and temporally consistent trajectories, and comprehensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance and low-latency inference performance compared with recently proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[R$^2$PO: Decoupling Training Trajectories from Inference Responses for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11960v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has become a central paradigm for improving LLM reasoning. However, existing methods use a single policy to produce both inference responses and training optimization trajectories. The objective conflict between generating stable inference responses and diverse training trajectories leads to insufficient exploration, which harms reasoning capability. In this paper, to address the problem, we propose R$^2$PO (Residual Rollout Policy Optimization), which introduces a lightweight Residual Rollout-Head atop the policy to decouple training trajectories from inference responses, enabling controlled trajectory diversification during training while keeping inference generation stable. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms baselines, achieving average accuracy gains of 3.4% on MATH-500 and 1.3% on APPS, while also reducing formatting errors and mitigating length bias for stable optimization.

We extend this line of work to the social sciences by introducing a Transformer-based generative model tailored to longitudinal socio-economic data. Our contributions are: (i) we design a novel encoding method that represents socio-economic life histories as sequences, including overlapping events across life domains; and (ii) we adapt generative modelling techniques to simulate plausible alternative life trajectories conditioned on past histories. Using large-scale data from the Italian social security administration (INPS), we show that the model can be trained at scale, reproduces realistic labour market patterns consistent with known causal relationships, and generates coherent hypothetical life paths. This work demonstrates the feasibility of generative modelling for socio-economic trajectories and opens new opportunities for policy-oriented research, with counterfactual generation as a particularly promising application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emerging from Ground: Addressing Intent Deviation in Tool-Using Agents via Deriving Real Calls into Virtual Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15120v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have advanced tool-using agents for real-world applications, yet they often lead to unexpected behaviors or results. Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of "intent deviation" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a "Real-to-Virtual" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses. Integrating with training, RISE achieves an average 35.28% improvement in Acctask (task completion) and 23.27% in Accintent (intent alignment), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20--42.09% and 1.17--54.93% respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAD-TRO: Projection-Augmented Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04436v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have gained popularity and attention in trajectory optimization due to their capability of modeling multi-modal probability distributions. However, addressing nonlinear equality constraints, i.e, dynamic feasibility, remains a great challenge in diffusion-based trajectory optimization. Recent diffusion-based trajectory optimization frameworks rely on a single-shooting style approach where the denoised control sequence is applied to forward propagate the dynamical system, which cannot explicitly enforce constraints on the states and frequently leads to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we propose a novel direct trajectory optimization approach via model-based diffusion, which directly generates a sequence of states. To ensure dynamic feasibility, we propose a gradient-free projection mechanism that is incorporated into the reverse diffusion process. Our results show that, compared to a recent state-of-the-art baseline, our approach leads to zero dynamic feasibility error and approximately 4x higher success rate in a quadrotor waypoint navigation scenario involving dense static obstacles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2026 American Control Conference</p></details> |
| **[CLEANER: Self-Purified Trajectories Boost Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15141v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to utilize tools like Python interpreters for complex problem-solving. However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops. Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. Notably, CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, highlighting trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL.

| **[Context-aware Learned Mesh-based Simulation via Trajectory-Level Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05234v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating object deformations is a critical challenge across many scientific domains, including robotics, manufacturing, and structural mechanics. Learned Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer a promising alternative to traditional mesh-based physics simulators. Their speed and inherent differentiability make them particularly well suited for applications that require fast and accurate simulations, such as robotic manipulation or manufacturing optimization. However, existing learned simulators typically rely on single-step observations, which limits their ability to exploit temporal context. Without this information, these models fail to infer, e.g., material properties. Further, they rely on auto-regressive rollouts, which quickly accumulate error for long trajectories. We instead frame mesh-based simulation as a trajectory-level meta-learning problem. Using Conditional Neural Processes, our method enables rapid adaptation to new simulation scenarios from limited initial data while capturing their latent simulation properties. We utilize movement primitives to directly predict fast, stable and accurate simulations from a single model call. The resulting approach, Movement-primitive Meta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of the runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art GNSs across several tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages.

| **[Trajectory-Driven Multi-Product Influence Maximization in Billboard Advertising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14737v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Billboard Advertising has emerged as an effective out-of-home advertising technique, where the goal is to select a limited number of slots and play advertisement content there, with the hope that it will be observed by many people and, effectively, a significant number of them will be influenced towards the brand. Given a trajectory and a billboard database and a positive integer $k$, how can we select $k$ highly influential slots to maximize influence? In this paper, we study a variant of this problem where a commercial house wants to make a promotion of multiple products, and there is an influence demand for each product. We have studied two variants of the problem. In the first variant, our goal is to select $k$ slots such that the respective influence demand of each product is satisfied. In the other variant of the problem, we are given with $\ell$ integers $k_1,k_2, \ldots, k_{\ell}$, the goal here is to search for $\ell$ many set of slots $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_{\ell}$ such that for all $i \in [\ell]$, $|S_{i}| \leq k_i$ and for all $i \neq j$, $S_i \cap S_j=\emptyset$ and the influence demand of each of the products gets satisfied. We model the first variant of the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and the second variant as its generalization. To solve the common-slot variant, we formulate the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and design a bi-criteria approximation algorithm based on the continuous greedy framework and randomized rounding. For the disjoint-slot variant, we proposed a sampling-based approximation approach along with an efficient primal-dual greedy algorithm that enforces disjointness naturally. Extensive experiments with real-world trajectory and billboard datasets highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 Pa...</summary><p>31 Pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2510.09050</p></details> |

Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors. We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

A Simple Metric of Informative Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14249v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories provide rich supervision signals for distilling reasoning from teacher to student LLMs. However, both prior work and our experiments show that trajectories from stronger teachers do not necessarily yield better students, highlighting the importance of data-student suitability in distillation. Existing methods assess suitability primarily through student likelihood, favoring trajectories that closely align with the model's current behavior but overlooking more informative ones. Addressing this, we propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), a simple metric that captures both alignment and informativeness to assess the suitability of a reasoning trajectory. RSR is motivated by the observation that effective trajectories typically combine low absolute probability with relatively high-ranked tokens under the student model, balancing learning signal strength and behavioral alignment. Concretely, RSR is defined as the ratio of a trajectory's average token-wise rank to its average negative log-likelihood, and is straightforward to compute and interpret. Across five student models and reasoning trajectories from 11 diverse teachers, RSR strongly correlates with post-training performance (average Spearman 0.86), outperforming existing metrics. We further demonstrate its practical utility in both trajectory selection and teacher selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages.

A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03515v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations. Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably, WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving. Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without proper validation against independently collected data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Surrogate Models for Adaptive Aircraft Trajectory Prediction in En route Airspace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03075v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction (TP) is crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency in modern air traffic management systems. It is, for example, a core component of conflict detection and resolution tools, arrival sequencing algorithms, capacity planning, as well as several future concepts. However, TP accuracy within operational systems is hampered by a range of epistemic uncertainties such as the mass and performance settings of aircraft and the effect of meteorological conditions on aircraft performance. It can also require considerable computational resources. This paper proposes a method for adaptive TP that has two components: first, a fast surrogate TP model based on linear state space models (LSSM)s with an execution time that was 6.7 times lower on average than an implementation of the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) in Python. It is demonstrated that such models can effectively emulate the BADA aircraft performance model, which is based on the numerical solution of a partial differential equation (PDE), and that the LSSMs can be fitted to trajectories in a dataset of historic flight data. Secondly, the paper proposes an algorithm to assimilate radar observations using particle filtering to adaptively refine TP accuracy. Comparison with baselines using BADA and Kalman filtering demonstrate that the proposed framework improves system identification and state estimation for both climb and descent phases, with 46.3% and 64.7% better estimates for time to top of climb and bottom of descent compared to the best performing benchmark model. In particular, the particle filtering approach provides the flexibility to capture non-linear performance effects including the CAS-Mach transition.</p></details> |  |

| **[Post-Training as Reweighting: A Stochastic View of Reasoning Trajectories in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07368v2)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models encode rich structural knowledge but often rely on post-training procedures to adapt their reasoning behavior to specific tasks. Popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and inference-time reward aggregation are typically analyzed from a performance perspective, leaving their effects on the underlying reasoning distribution less understood. In this work, we study post-training reasoning from a stochastic trajectory viewpoint. Following Kim et al. (2025), we model reasoning steps of varying difficulty as Markov transitions with different probabilities, and formalize reasoning processes using tree-structured Markov chains. Within this framework, pretraining corresponds to discovering the reasoning structure, while post-training primarily reweights existing chains of thought. We show that both RLVR and inference-time reward aggregation concentrate probability mass on a small number of high-probability trajectories, leading to the suppression of rare but essential reasoning paths. As a consequence, solving hard instances often depends on low-probability trajectories already present in the base model. We further prove that exploration-oriented mechanisms, such as rejecting easy instances and applying KL regularization, help preserve these rare trajectories. Empirical simulations support our theoretical analysis.</p></details> |  |

Developing accurate prediction algorithms relies on reliable, multimodal, and realistic datasets; however, such datasets for roundabout scenarios are scarce, as real-world data collection is often limited by incomplete observations and entangled factors that are difficult to isolate. We present CARLA-Round, a systematically designed simulation dataset for roundabout trajectory prediction. The dataset varies weather conditions (five types) and traffic density levels (spanning Level-of-Service A-E) in a structured manner, resulting in 25 controlled scenarios. Each scenario incorporates realistic mixtures of driving behaviors and provides explicit annotations that are largely absent from existing datasets. Unlike randomly sampled simulation data, this structured design enables precise analysis of how different conditions influence trajectory prediction performance. Validation experiments using standard baselines (LSTM, GCN, GRU+GCN) reveal traffic density dominates prediction difficulty with strong monotonic effects, while weather shows non-linear impacts. The best model achieves 0.312m ADE on real-world rounD dataset, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer. This systematic approach quantifies factor impacts impossible to isolate in confounded real-world datasets. Our CARLA-Round dataset is available at https://github.com/Rebecca689/CARLA-Round.</p></details> |  |

In this approach a discrete path optimization problem is defined on a static navigation mesh, and trajectories are modeled as random variables governed by a parametric Markov policy. The discrete path optimization problem is then replaced with an equivalent stochastic optimization problem over the policy parameters, resulting in an optimal probability model that samples estimates of the optimal discrete path. This approach enables exploration of the utility function's distribution tail and treats the utility function of the design as a black box, making it applicable to linear and nonlinear inverse problems and beyond experimental design. Numerical verification and analysis are carried out by using a parameter identification problem widely used in model-based optimal experimental design.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 Fi...</summary><p>42 Figures, this version includes supplementary material as appendices</p></details> |
| **[iReasoner: Trajectory-Aware Intrinsic Reasoning Supervision for Self-Evolving Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05877v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work shows that large multimodal models (LMMs) can self-improve from unlabeled data via self-play and intrinsic feedback. Yet existing self-evolving frameworks mainly reward final outcomes, leaving intermediate reasoning weakly constrained despite its importance for visually grounded decision making. We propose iReasoner, a self-evolving framework that improves an LMM's implicit reasoning by explicitly eliciting chain-of-thought (CoT) and rewarding its internal agreement. In a Proposer--Solver loop over unlabeled images, iReasoner augments outcome-level intrinsic rewards with a trajectory-aware signal defined over intermediate reasoning steps, providing learning signals that distinguish reasoning paths leading to the same answer without ground-truth labels or external judges. Starting from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, iReasoner yields up to $+2.1$ points across diverse multimodal reasoning benchmarks under fully unsupervised post-training. We hope this work serves as a starting point for reasoning-aware self-improvement in LMMs in purely unsupervised settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attesting Model Lineage by Consisted Knowledge Evolution with Fine-Tuning Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11683v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fine-tuning technique in deep learning gives rise to an emerging lineage relationship among models. This lineage provides a promising perspective for addressing security concerns such as unauthorized model redistribution and false claim of model provenance, which are particularly pressing in \textcolor{blue}{open-weight model} libraries where robust lineage verification mechanisms are often lacking. Existing approaches to model lineage detection primarily rely on static architectural similarities, which are insufficient to capture the dynamic evolution of knowledge that underlies true lineage relationships. Drawing inspiration from the genetic mechanism of human evolution, we tackle the problem of model lineage attestation by verifying the joint trajectory of knowledge evolution and parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel model lineage attestation framework. In our framework, model editing is first leveraged to quantify parameter-level changes introduced by fine-tuning. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge vectorization mechanism that refines the evolved knowledge within the edited models into compact representations by the assistance of probe samples. The probing strategies are adapted to different types of model families. These embeddings serve as the foundation for verifying the arithmetic consistency of knowledge relationships across models, thereby enabling robust attestation of model lineage. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and resilience of our approach in a variety of adversarial scenarios in the real world. Our method consistently achieves reliable lineage verification across a broad spectrum of model types, including classifiers, diffusion models, and large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 35th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 2026)</p></details> |
| **[DeepUrban: Interaction-Aware Trajectory Prediction and Planning for Automated Driving by Aerial Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10554v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficacy of autonomous driving systems hinges critically on robust prediction and planning capabilities. However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

Our study aims to determine the underlying factors shaping mental health trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Methods: Data from the Understanding Society COVID-19 Study were utilized and the core analysis focussed on GHQ36 scores as the outcome variable. We used GAMs to evaluate trends over time and the role of sociodemographic variables, i.e., age, sex, ethnicity, country of residence (in UK), job status (employment), household income, living with a partner, living with children under age 16, and living with a long-term illness, on the variation of mental health during the study period. Results: Statistically significant differences in mental health were observed for age, sex,ethnicity, country of residence (in UK), job status (employment), household income, living with a partner, living with children under age 16, and living with a long-term illness. Women experienced higher GHQ36 scores relative to men with the GHQ36 score expected to increase by 1.260 (95%CI: 1.176, 1.345). Individuals living without a partner were expected to have higher GHQ36 scores, of 1.050 (95%CI: 0.949, 1.148) more than those living with a partner, and age groups 16-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64 experienced higher GHQ36 scores relative to those who were 65+. Individuals with relatively lower household income were likely to have poorer mental health relative to those who were more well off. Conclusion: This study identifies key demographic determinants shaping mental health trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Policies aiming to reduce mental health inequalities should target women, youth, individuals living without a partner, individuals living with children under 16, individuals with a long-term illness, and lower income families.</p></details> | 5 figures |

Current visual navigation methods are typically limited to simulated or off-street environments, and often rely on precise goal formats, such as specific coordinates or images. This limits their effectiveness for autonomous agents like last-mile delivery robots navigating unfamiliar cities. To address these limitations, we introduce UrbanNav, a scalable framework that trains embodied agents to follow free-form language instructions in diverse urban settings. Leveraging web-scale city walking videos, we develop an scalable annotation pipeline that aligns human navigation trajectories with language instructions grounded in real-world landmarks. UrbanNav encompasses over 1,500 hours of navigation data and 3 million instruction-trajectory-landmark triplets, capturing a wide range of urban scenarios. Our model learns robust navigation policies to tackle complex urban scenarios, demonstrating superior spatial reasoning, robustness to noisy instructions, and generalization to unseen urban settings. Experimental results show that UrbanNav significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the potential of large-scale web video data to enable language-guided, real-world urban navigation for embodied agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, accepted to AAAI 2026.

| **[Unlocking Implicit Experience: Synthesizing Tool-Use Trajectories from Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10355v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively utilize tools in multi-turn interactions is essential for building capable autonomous agents. However, acquiring diverse and realistic multi-turn tool-use data remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel text-based paradigm. We observe that textual corpora naturally contain rich, multi-step problem-solving experiences, which can serve as an untapped, scalable, and authentic data source for multi-turn tool-use tasks. Based on this insight, we introduce GEM, a data synthesis pipeline that enables the generation and extraction of multi-turn tool-use trajectories from text corpora through a four-stage process: relevance filtering, workflow & tool extraction, trajectory grounding, and complexity refinement. To reduce the computational cost, we further train a specialized Trajectory Synthesizer via supervised fine-tuning. This model distills the complex generation pipeline into an efficient, end-to-end trajectory generator. Experiments demonstrate that our GEM-32B achieve a 16.5% improvement on the BFCL V3 Multi-turn benchmark. Our models partially surpass the performance of models trained on τ - bench (Airline and Retail) in-domain data, highlighting the superior generalization capability derived from our text-based synthesis paradigm. Notably, our Trajectory Synthesizer matches the quality of the full pipeline while significantly reducing inference latency and costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10348v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient distillation is a key pathway for converting expensive reasoning capability into deployable efficiency, yet in the frontier regime where the student already has strong reasoning ability, naive continual distillation often yields limited gains or even degradation. We observe a characteristic training phenomenon: even as loss decreases monotonically, all performance metrics can drop sharply at almost the same bottleneck, before gradually recovering. We further uncover a token-level mechanism: confidence bifurcates into steadily increasing Imitation-Anchor Tokens that quickly anchor optimization and other yet-to-learn tokens whose confidence is suppressed until after the bottleneck. And the characteristic that these two types of tokens cannot coexist is the root cause of the failure in continual distillation. To this end, we propose Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection (T3S) to reconstruct the training objective at the token level, clearing the optimization path for yet-to-learn tokens. T3 yields consistent gains in both AR and dLLM settings: with only hundreds of examples, Qwen3-8B surpasses DeepSeek-R1 on competitive reasoning benchmarks, Qwen3-32B approaches Qwen3-235B, and T3-trained LLaDA-2.0-Mini exceeds its AR baseline, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all of 16B-scale no-think models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep g-Pricing for CSI 300 Index Options with Volatility Trajectories and Market Sentiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18804v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Option pricing in real markets faces fundamental challenges. The Black--Scholes--Merton (BSM) model assumes constant volatility and uses a linear generator $g(t,x,y,z)=-ry$, while lacking explicit behavioral factors, resulting in systematic departures from observed dynamics. This paper extends the BSM model by learning a nonlinear generator within a deep Forward--Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE) framework. We propose a dual-network architecture where the value network $u_θ$ learns option prices and the generator network $g_φ$ characterizes the pricing mechanism, with the hedging strategy $Z_t=σ_t X_t \nabla_x u_θ$ obtained via automatic differentiation. The framework adopts forward recursion from a learnable initial condition $Y_0=u_θ(0,\cdot)$, naturally accommodating volatility trajectory and sentiment features. Empirical results on CSI 300 index options show that our method reduces Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 32.2\% and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by 35.3\% compared with BSM. Interpretability analysis indicates that architectural improvements are effective across all option types, while the information advantage is asymmetric between calls and puts. Specifically, call option improvements are primarily driven by sentiment features, whereas put options show more balanced contributions from volatility trajectory and sentiment features. This finding aligns with economic intuition regarding option pricing mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 10 tables.

With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReflexDiffusion: Reflection-Enhanced Trajectory Planning for High-lateral-acceleration Scenarios in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09377v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating safe and reliable trajectories for autonomous vehicles in long-tail scenarios remains a significant challenge, particularly for high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers such as sharp turns, which represent critical safety situations. Existing trajectory planners exhibit systematic failures in these scenarios due to data imbalance. This results in insufficient modelling of vehicle dynamics, road geometry, and environmental constraints in high-risk situations, leading to suboptimal or unsafe trajectory prediction when vehicles operate near their physical limits. In this paper, we introduce ReflexDiffusion, a novel inference-stage framework that enhances diffusion-based trajectory planners through reflective adjustment. Our method introduces a gradient-based adjustment mechanism during the iterative denoising process: after each standard trajectory update, we compute the gradient between the conditional and unconditional noise predictions to explicitly amplify critical conditioning signals, including road curvature and lateral vehicle dynamics. This amplification enforces strict adherence to physical constraints, particularly improving stability during high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers where precise vehicle-road interaction is paramount. Evaluated on the nuPlan Test14-hard benchmark, ReflexDiffusion achieves a 14.1% improvement in driving score for high-lateral-acceleration scenarios over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This demonstrates that inference-time trajectory optimization can effectively compensate for training data sparsity by dynamically reinforcing safety-critical constraints near handling limits. The framework's architecture-agnostic design enables direct deployment to existing diffusion-based planners, offering a practical solution for improving autonomous vehicle safety in challenging driving conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Trajectory Optimization for Arbitrary-Shaped Mobile Robots via Polynomial Separating Hypersurfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09231v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An emerging class of trajectory optimization methods enforces collision avoidance by jointly optimizing the robot's configuration and a separating hyperplane. However, as linear separators only apply to convex sets, these methods require convex approximations of both the robot and obstacles, which becomes an overly conservative assumption in cluttered and narrow environments. In this work, we unequivocally remove this limitation by introducing nonlinear separating hypersurfaces parameterized by polynomial functions. We first generalize the classical separating hyperplane theorem and prove that any two disjoint bounded closed sets in Euclidean space can be separated by a polynomial hypersurface, serving as the theoretical foundation for nonlinear separation of arbitrary geometries. Building on this result, we formulate a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem that jointly optimizes the robot's trajectory and the coefficients of the separating polynomials, enabling geometry-aware collision avoidance without conservative convex simplifications. The optimization remains efficiently solvable using standard NLP solvers. Simulation and real-world experiments with nonconvex robots demonstrate that our method achieves smooth, collision-free, and agile maneuvers in environments where convex-approximation baselines fail.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods for map matching are generally based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or encoder-decoder framework. However, these methods continue to face significant challenges when handling noisy or sparsely sampled GPS trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose DiffMM, an encoder-diffusion-based map matching framework that produces effective yet efficient matching results through a one-step diffusion process. We first introduce a road segment-aware trajectory encoder that jointly embeds the input trajectory and its surrounding candidate road segments into a shared latent space through an attention mechanism. Next, we propose a one step diffusion method to realize map matching through a shortcut model by leveraging the joint embedding of the trajectory and candidate road segments as conditioning context. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art map matching methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, particularly for sparse trajectories and complex road network topologies.</p></details> | AAAI-26 |

Repeated sampling over the same input often produces divergent reasoning trajectories and inconsistent final predictions. To address this, we introduce two complementary approaches inspired by test-time scaling: (1) CASHEW, an inference-time framework that stabilizes reasoning by iteratively aggregating multiple candidate trajectories into higher-quality reasoning traces, with explicit visual verification filtering hallucinated steps and grounding reasoning in visual evidence, and (2) CASHEW-RL, a learned variant that internalizes this aggregation behavior within a single model. CASHEW-RL is trained using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) with a composite reward that encourages correct answers grounded in minimal yet sufficient visual evidence, while adaptively allocating reasoning effort based on task difficulty. This training objective enables robust self-aggregation at inference. Extensive experiments on 13 image understanding, video understanding, and video reasoning benchmarks show significant performance improvements, including gains of up to +23.6 percentage points on ScienceQA and +8.1 percentage points on EgoSchema.</p></details> |  |
| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v4)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |

However, existing client simulation approaches face three key challenges: (1) limited diversity and realism in client profiles, (2) the lack of a principled framework for modeling realistic client behaviors, and (3) a scarcity in Chinese-language settings. To address these limitations, we propose PsyCLIENT, a novel simulation framework grounded in conversational trajectory modeling. By conditioning LLM generation on predefined real-world trajectories that incorporate explicit behavior labels and content constraints, our approach ensures diverse and realistic interactions. We further introduce PsyCLIENT-CP, the first open-source Chinese client profile dataset, covering 60 distinct counseling topics. Comprehensive evaluations involving licensed professional counselors demonstrate that PsyCLIENT significantly outperforms baselines in terms of authenticity and training effectiveness. Notably, the simulated clients are nearly indistinguishable from human clients, achieving an about 95\% expert confusion rate in discrimination tasks. These findings indicate that conversational trajectory modeling effectively bridges the gap between theoretical client profiles and dynamic, realistic simulations, offering a robust solution for mental health education and research. Code and data will be released to facilitate future research in mental health counseling.</p></details> |  |

Existing imputation methods emphasize trajectory recovery, paying limited attention to interpretability and failing to provide underlying knowledge that benefits downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and route planning. We propose knowledge-driven interpretable vessel trajectory imputation (VISTA), the first trajectory imputation framework that offers interpretability while simultaneously providing underlying knowledge to support downstream analysis. Specifically, we first define underlying knowledge as a combination of Structured Data-derived Knowledge (SDK) distilled from AIS data and Implicit LLM Knowledge acquired from large-scale Internet corpora. Second, to manage and leverage the SDK effectively at scale, we develop a data-knowledge-data loop that employs a Structured Data-derived Knowledge Graph for SDK extraction and knowledge-driven trajectory imputation. Third, to efficiently process large-scale AIS data, we introduce a workflow management layer that coordinates the end-to-end pipeline, enabling parallel knowledge extraction and trajectory imputation with anomaly handling and redundancy elimination. Experiments on two large AIS datasets show that VISTA is capable of state-of-the-art imputation accuracy and computational efficiency, improving over state-of-the-art baselines by 5%-94% and reducing time cost by 51%-93%, while producing interpretable knowledge cues that benefit downstream tasks.

| **[Mobility Trajectories from Network-Driven Markov Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06020v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a generative model of human mobility in which trajectories arise as realizations of a prescribed, time-dependent Markov dynamics defined on a spatial interaction network. The model constructs a hierarchical routing structure with hubs, corridors, feeder paths, and metro links, and specifies transition matrices using gravity-type distance decay combined with externally imposed temporal schedules and directional biases. Population mass evolves as indistinguishable, memoryless movers performing a single transition per time step. When aggregated, the resulting trajectories reproduce structured origin-destination flows that reflect network geometry, temporal modulation, and connectivity constraints. By applying the Perron-Frobenius theorem to the daily evolution operator, we identify a unique periodic invariant population distribution that serves as a natural non-transient reference state. We verify consistency between trajectory-level realizations and multi-step Markov dynamics, showing that discrepancies are entirely attributable to finite-population sampling. The framework provides a network-centric, privacy-preserving approach to generating mobility trajectories and studying time-elapsed flow structure without invoking individual-level behavioral assumptions.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

This pattern is also often observed within-seasons, as an athlete aims for their performance to peak at key events such as the Olympic Games or World Championships. A Bayesian hierarchical model is developed to analyse the evolution of athletic sporting performance throughout an athlete's career and separate these effects whilst allowing for confounding factors such as environmental conditions. Our model works in continuous time and estimates both $g(t)$, the average performance level of the population at age $t$, and $f_i(t)$, the difference of the $i$-th athlete from this average. We further decompose $f_i(t)$ into a season-to-season trajectory and a within-season trajectory, which is modelled by a restricted Bernstein polynomial. The model is fitted using an adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm with a carefully chosen blocking scheme. The model allows us to understand seasonal patterns in athlete performance, how these differ between athletes, and provides individual fitted and trend performance trajectories. The properties of the model are illustrated using a simulation study and an application to 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle swimming for both female and male athletes.</p></details> |  |

However, we find that directly applying these techniques to image-to-video (I2V) models often fails to yield consistent reward improvements. To address this limitation, we present TAGRPO, a robust post-training framework for I2V models inspired by contrastive learning. Our approach is grounded in the observation that rollout videos generated from identical initial noise provide superior guidance for optimization. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel GRPO loss applied to intermediate latents, encouraging direct alignment with high-reward trajectories while maximizing distance from low-reward counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a memory bank for rollout videos to enhance diversity and reduce computational overhead. Despite its simplicity, TAGRPO achieves significant improvements over DanceGRPO in I2V generation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Immunological Density Shapes Recovery Trajectories in Long COVID](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07854v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Long COVID) frequently persists for months, yet drivers of clinical remission remain incompletely defined. Here we analyzed 97,564 longitudinal PASC assessments from 13,511 participants with linked vaccination histories to disentangle passive temporal progression from vaccine-associated change. Using a clinically validated threshold (PASC $\geq 12$), trajectories separated into three phenotypes: Protected (persistently sub-threshold), Refractory (persistently symptomatic), and Responders (transitioning from symptomatic to recovered). Across the full cohort, symptom severity increased modestly with elapsed time ($r=0.0521$, $P=1.26\times10^{-59}$), whereas cumulative vaccination showed an inverse association with severity ($r=-0.0434$, $P=5.95\times10^{-42}$). In summary, baseline Long COVID severity appears clinically deterministic. In the absence of intervention, symptoms typically persist without spontaneous resolution. Recovery is primarily associated with repeated immunization.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAPM-Net: Trajectory-Aware Perturbation Modeling for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05446v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared small target detection (ISTD) remains a long-standing challenge due to weak signal contrast, limited spatial extent, and cluttered backgrounds. Despite performance improvements from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), current models lack a mechanism to trace how small targets trigger directional, layer-wise perturbations in the feature space, which is an essential cue for distinguishing signal from structured noise in infrared scenes. To address this limitation, we propose the Trajectory-Aware Mamba Propagation Network (TAPM-Net), which explicitly models the spatial diffusion behavior of target-induced feature disturbances. TAPM-Net is built upon two novel components: a Perturbation-guided Path Module (PGM) and a Trajectory-Aware State Block (TASB). The PGM constructs perturbation energy fields from multi-level features and extracts gradient-following feature trajectories that reflect the directionality of local responses. The resulting feature trajectories are fed into the TASB, a Mamba-based state-space unit that models dynamic propagation along each trajectory while incorporating velocity-constrained diffusion and semantically aligned feature fusion from word-level and sentence-level embeddings. Unlike existing attention-based methods, TAPM-Net enables anisotropic, context-sensitive state transitions along spatial trajectories while maintaining global coherence at low computational cost. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1K demonstrate that TAPM-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in ISTD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in BMVC 2025 see: https://bmva-archive.org.uk/bmvc/2025/assets/papers/Paper_709/paper.pdf.

We aim to endow computational systems with a similar ability to predict plausible future object motions directly from passive visual observation. We introduce ObjectForesight, a 3D object-centric dynamics model that predicts future 6-DoF poses and trajectories of rigid objects from short egocentric video sequences. Unlike conventional world or dynamics models that operate in pixel or latent space, ObjectForesight represents the world explicitly in 3D at the object level, enabling geometrically grounded and temporally coherent predictions that capture object affordances and trajectories. To train such a model at scale, we leverage recent advances in segmentation, mesh reconstruction, and 3D pose estimation to curate a dataset of 2 million plus short clips with pseudo-ground-truth 3D object trajectories. Through extensive experiments, we show that ObjectForesight achieves significant gains in accuracy, geometric consistency, and generalization to unseen objects and scenes, establishing a scalable framework for learning physically grounded, object-centric dynamics models directly from observation. objectforesight.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Remote assistance concepts, where operators provide discrete inputs to aid specific automation modules like planning, is gaining interest due to its reduced workload on the human remote operator and improved safety. However, these concepts are challenging to implement and maintain due to their deep integration and interaction with the automated driving system. In this paper, we propose a solution to facilitate the implementation of remote assistance concepts that intervene on planning level and extend the operational design domain of the vehicle at runtime. Using arbitration graphs, a modular decision-making framework, we integrate remote assistance into an existing automated driving system without modifying the original software components. Our simulative implementation demonstrates this approach in two use cases, allowing operators to adjust planner constraints and enable trajectory generation beyond nominal operational design domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, presented at IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium 2025, video demonstration available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVSO-YOeGMk</p></details> |

This study extends the scope to online refinement of the entire capacity fade trajectory (CFT) through EntroLnn, a framework based on entropy-guided transformable liquid neural networks (LNNs). EntroLnn treats CFT refinement as an integrated process rather than two independent tasks for pointwise SoH and EoL. We introduce entropy-based features derived from online temperature fields, applied for the first time in battery analytics, and combine them with customized LNNs that model temporal battery dynamics effectively. The framework enhances both static and dynamic adaptability of LNNs and achieves robust and generalizable CFT refinement across different batteries and operating conditions. The approach provides a high fidelity battery health model with lightweight computation, achieving mean absolute errors of only 0.004577 for CFT and 18 cycles for EoL prediction. This work establishes a foundation for entropy-informed learning in battery analytics and enables self-adaptive, lightweight, and interpretable battery health prediction in practical battery management systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

In this study, we provide a multilinguistic, large-scale assessment of this similarity by systematically comparing 16 publicly available pretrained LLMs with human brain responses during natural language processing tasks in both English and Chinese. Specifically, we use ridge regression to assess the representational similarity between LLM embeddings and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and analyze the similarity between the "neural trajectory" and the "LLM latent trajectory." This method captures key dynamic patterns, such as magnitude, angle, uncertainty, and confidence. Our findings highlight both similarities and crucial differences in processing strategies: (1) We show that middle-to-high layers of LLMs are central to semantic integration and correspond to the N400 component observed in EEG; (2) The brain exhibits continuous and iterative processing during reading, whereas LLMs often show discrete, stage-end bursts of activity, which suggests a stark contrast in their real-time semantic processing dynamics. This study could offer new insights into LLMs and neural processing, and also establish a critical framework for future investigations into the alignment between artificial intelligence and biological intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[PILOT: Planning via Internalized Latent Optimization Trajectories for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19917v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strategic planning is critical for multi-step reasoning, yet compact Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the capacity to formulate global strategies, leading to error propagation in long-horizon tasks. Our analysis reveals that LLMs possess latent reasoning capabilities that can be unlocked when conditioned on explicit plans from a teacher model; however, runtime reliance on external guidance is often impractical due to latency and availability constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose PILOT (Planning via Internalized Latent Optimization Trajectories), a non-invasive framework designed to internalize the strategic oversight of large models into intrinsic Latent Guidance. Instead of altering backbone weights, PILOT employs a lightweight Hyper-Network to synthesize a query-conditioned Latent Guidance vector. This vector acts as an internal steering mechanism, guiding the model's representations toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on mathematical and coding benchmarks demonstrate that PILOT effectively stabilizes reasoning trajectories, consistently outperforming strong baselines (e.g., +8.9% on MATH500) with negligible inference latency.</p></details> |  |

However, existing pruning methods typically rely on sequential revisions driven by unreliable critique signals, often failing to detect the loss of answer-critical data. To address this limitation, we propose TabTrim, a novel table pruning framework which transforms table pruning from sequential revisions to gold trajectory-supervised parallel search. TabTrim derives a gold pruning trajectory using the intermediate sub-tables in the execution process of gold SQL queries, and trains a pruner and a verifier to make the step-wise pruning result align with the gold pruning trajectory. During inference, TabTrim performs parallel search to explore multiple candidate pruning trajectories and identify the optimal sub-table. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TabTrim achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tabular reasoning tasks: TabTrim-8B reaches 73.5% average accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.2%, including 79.4% on WikiTQ and 61.2% on TableBench.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

Starting with a small number of embodiment-flexible human demonstrations collected in a virtual reality simulation environment, the pipeline refines these demonstrations using optimization-based kinematic retargeting and trajectory optimization to adapt them across various robot embodiments and physical parameters. This process yields a diverse, physically consistent dataset that enables cross-embodiment data transfer, and offers the potential to reuse legacy datasets collected under different hardware configurations or physical parameters. We validate the pipeline's effectiveness by training diffusion policies from the generated datasets for challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks across multiple robot embodiments, including a floating Allegro hand and bimanual robot arms. The trained policies are deployed zero-shot on hardware for bimanual iiwa arms, achieving high success rates with minimal human input.

While text-based affect inference has become increasingly feasible, prior approaches often treat sentiment as a deterministic point estimate for individual speakers, failing to capture the inherent subjectivity, latent ambiguity, and sequential coupling found in mutual exchanges. We introduce LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework that characterizes emotion not as a static label, but as a continuous latent probability distribution defined over an affective space. By leveraging stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation, the methodology approximates these distributions to derive high-fidelity sentiment trajectories that explicitly quantify both central affective tendencies and perceptual ambiguity. These trajectories enable a structured analysis of interpersonal coupling through sequential cross-correlation and slope-based indicators, identifying leading or lagging influences between interlocutors. To validate the interpretive capacity of this approach, we utilize teacher-student instructional dialogues as a representative case study, where our quantitative indicators successfully distill high-level interaction insights such as effective scaffolding. This work establishes a scalable and deployable pathway for understanding interpersonal dynamics, offering a generalizable solution that extends beyond education to broader social and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Continuous-Time Trajectory Estimation via Gaussian Processes and the Magnus Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03360v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous-time state estimation has been shown to be an effective means of (i) handling asynchronous and high-rate measurements, (ii) introducing smoothness to the estimate, (iii) post hoc querying the estimate at times other than those of the measurements, and (iv) addressing certain observability issues related to scanning-while-moving sensors. A popular means of representing the trajectory in continuous time is via a Gaussian process (GP) prior, with the prior's mean and covariance functions generated by a linear time-varying (LTV) stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by white noise. When the state comprises elements of Lie groups, previous works have resorted to a patchwork of local GPs each with a linear time-invariant SDE kernel, which while effective in practice, lacks theoretical elegance. Here we revisit the full LTV GP approach to continuous-time trajectory estimation, deriving a global GP prior on Lie groups via the Magnus expansion, which offers a more elegant and general solution. We provide a numerical comparison between the two approaches and discuss their relative merits.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Dual-quaternion learning control for autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking with safety guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03097v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a learning-based trajectory tracking controller for autonomous robotic platforms whose motion can be described kinematically on $\mathrm{SE}(3)$. The controller is formulated in the dual quaternion framework and operates at the velocity level, assuming direct command of angular and linear velocities, as is standard in many aerial vehicles and omnidirectional mobile robots. Gaussian Process (GP) regression is integrated into a geometric feedback law to learn and compensate online for unknown, state-dependent disturbances and modeling imperfections affecting both attitude and position, while preserving the algebraic structure and coupling properties inherent to rigid-body motion. The proposed approach does not rely on explicit parametric models of the unknown effects, making it well-suited for robotic systems subject to sensor-induced disturbances, unmodeled actuation couplings, and environmental uncertainties. A Lyapunov-based analysis establishes probabilistic ultimate boundedness of the pose tracking error under bounded GP uncertainty, providing formal stability guarantees for the learning-based controller. Simulation results demonstrate accurate and smooth trajectory tracking in the presence of realistic, localized disturbances, including correlated rotational and translational effects arising from magnetometer perturbations. These results illustrate the potential of combining geometric modeling and probabilistic learning to achieve robust, data-efficient pose control for autonomous robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Action: Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09990v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation; reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Swept Volume-Based Trajectory Generation for Arbitrary-Shaped Ground Robot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07554v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating an arbitrary-shaped ground robot safely in cluttered environments remains a challenging problem. The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-Regularized Generative Auto-Bidding: From Suboptimal Trajectories to Optimal Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02754v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of e-commerce, auto-bidding has become a key asset in optimizing advertising performance under diverse advertiser environments. The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning. To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.</p></details> | <details><summary>11pag...</summary><p>11pages, 5figures, In Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining</p></details> |

We propose Proactive Interactive Reasoning (PIR), a new reasoning paradigm that transforms LLMs from passive solvers into proactive inquirers that interleave reasoning with clarification. Unlike existing search- or tool-based frameworks that primarily address knowledge uncertainty by querying external environments, PIR targets premise- and intent-level uncertainty through direct interaction with the user. PIR is implemented via two core components: (1) an uncertainty-aware supervised fine-tuning procedure that equips models with interactive reasoning capability, and (2) a user-simulator-based policy optimization framework driven by a composite reward that aligns model behavior with user intent. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, code generation, and document editing demonstrate that PIR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 32.70\% higher accuracy, 22.90\% higher pass rate, and 41.36 BLEU improvement, while reducing nearly half of the reasoning computation and unnecessary interaction turns. Further reliability evaluations on factual knowledge, question answering, and missing-premise scenarios confirm the strong generalization and robustness of PIR. Model and code are publicly available at: \href{https://github.com/SUAT-AIRI/Proactive-Interactive-R1}</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is under review</p></details> |

To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models. Evaluation settings included (1) in-domain training and testing, (2) external validation on independent cohorts, and (3) a low-resource new-site adaptation scenario using real-world clinical notes from the Yale New Haven Health System.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 9 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |

To overcome this constraint, we introduce a framework to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting the mean phase-space evolution over a chosen time span $Δt$, enabling stable large-timestep updates far beyond the stability limits of classical integrators. To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF). Our models maintain comparable training and inference cost, but support significantly larger integration timesteps while trained directly on widely-available trajectory-free MLFF datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Text Creativity across Diverse Domains: A Dataset and Large Language Model Evaluator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19236v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creativity evaluation remains a challenging frontier for large language models (LLMs). Current evaluations heavily rely on inefficient and costly human judgments, hindering progress in enhancing machine creativity. While automated methods exist, ranging from psychological testing to heuristic- or prompting-based approaches, they often lack generalizability or alignment with human judgment. To address these issues, we propose a novel pairwise-comparison framework for assessing textual creativity that leverages shared contextual instructions to improve evaluation consistency. We introduce CreataSet, a large-scale dataset with 100K+ human-level and 1M+ synthetic creative instruction-response pairs spanning diverse open-domain tasks. Through training on CreataSet, we develop an LLM-based evaluator named CrEval. CrEval demonstrates remarkable superiority over existing methods in alignment with human judgments. Experimental results underscore the indispensable significance of integrating both human and synthetic data to train highly robust evaluators, and showcase the practical utility of CrEval in boosting the creativity of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, constrained by the capacity of their internal world knowledge, prior work has proposed augmenting MLLMs by ``reasoning-then-tool-call'' for visual and textual search engines to obtain substantial gains on tasks requiring extensive factual information. However, these approaches typically define multimodal search in a naive setting, assuming that a single full-level or entity-level image query and few text query suffices to retrieve the key evidence needed to answer the question, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with substantial visual noise. Moreover, they are often limited in the reasoning depth and search breadth, making it difficult to solve complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources. Building on this, we propose Vision-DeepResearch, which proposes one new multimodal deep-research paradigm, i.e., performs multi-turn, multi-entity and multi-scale visual and textual search to robustly hit real-world search engines under heavy noise. Our Vision-DeepResearch supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, while internalizing deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training, resulting in a strong end-to-end multimodal deep-research MLLM. It substantially outperforming existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs, and workflows built on strong closed-source foundation model such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-4-Sonnet.

| **[Per-parameter Task Arithmetic for Unlearning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22030v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large language model (LLM) unlearning, private information is required to be removed. Task arithmetic unlearns by subtracting a specific task vector (TV)--defined as the parameter difference between a privacy-information-tuned model and the original model. While efficient, it can cause over-forgetting by disrupting parameters essential for retaining other information. Motivated by the observation that each parameter exhibits different importance for forgetting versus retention, we propose a per-parameter task arithmetic (PerTA) mechanism to rescale the TV, allowing per-parameter adjustment. These weights quantify the relative importance of each parameter for forgetting versus retention, estimated via gradients (i.e., PerTA-grad) or the diagonal Fisher information approximation (i.e., PerTA-fisher). Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of PerTA, extend it to a more general form, and provide further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PerTA consistently improves upon standard TV, and in many cases surpasses widely used training-based unlearning methods in both forgetting effectiveness and overall model utility. By retaining the efficiency of task arithmetic while mitigating over-forgetting, PerTA offers a principled and practical framework for LLM unlearning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization for Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22020v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the model from revealing private information when queried about target images. Existing MLLM unlearning methods largely adopt approaches developed for LLMs. They treat all answer tokens uniformly, disregarding their varying importance in the unlearning process. Moreover, these methods focus exclusively on the language modality, disregarding visual cues that indicate key tokens in answers. In this paper, after formulating the problem of unlearning in multimodal question answering for MLLMs, we propose Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization (ViKeR). We leverage irrelevant visual inputs to predict ideal post-unlearning token-level distributions and use these distributions to regularize the unlearning process, thereby prioritizing key tokens. Further, we define key tokens in unlearning via information entropy and discuss ViKeR's effectiveness through token-level gradient reweighting, which amplifies updates on key tokens. Experiments on MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that our method effectively performs unlearning while mitigating forgetting and maintaining response coherence.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToolWeaver: Weaving Collaborative Semantics for Scalable Tool Use in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21947v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevalent retrieval-based tool-use pipelines struggle with a dual semantic challenge: their retrievers often employ encoders that fail to capture complex semantics, while the Large Language Model (LLM) itself lacks intrinsic tool knowledge from its natural language pretraining. Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>10pag...</summary><p>10pages, 12 figures, Accepted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Indeed, in many natural situations, while the nominal set of actions may be large, there also exist significant correlations between the rewards of different actions. In this paper we propose an algorithm that can significantly reduce the action space when such correlations are present, without the need to a-priori know the correlation structure. We provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of the algorithm and demonstrate its practical effectiveness through empirical comparisons with Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the capability of video aesthetic quality assessment, which is a fundamental ability for human, remains underexplored for LMMs. To address this, we introduce VideoAesBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LMMs' understanding of video aesthetic quality. VideoAesBench has several significant characteristics: (1) Diverse content including 1,804 videos from multiple video sources including user-generated (UGC), AI-generated (AIGC), compressed, robotic-generated (RGC), and game videos. (2) Multiple question formats containing traditional single-choice questions, multi-choice questions, True or False questions, and a novel open-ended questions for video aesthetics description. (3) Holistic video aesthetics dimensions including visual form related questions from 5 aspects, visual style related questions from 4 aspects, and visual affectiveness questions from 3 aspects. Based on VideoAesBench, we benchmark 23 open-source and commercial large multimodal models. Our findings show that current LMMs only contain basic video aesthetics perception ability, their performance remains incomplete and imprecise. We hope our VideoAesBench can be served as a strong testbed and offer insights for explainable video aesthetics assessment.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces GenOM, a large language model (LLM)-based ontology alignment framework, which enriches the semantic representations of ontology concepts via generating textual definitions, retrieves alignment candidates with an embedding model, and incorporates exact matching-based tools to improve precision. Extensive experiments conducted on the OAEI Bio-ML track demonstrate that GenOM can often achieve competitive performance, surpassing many baselines including traditional OM systems and recent LLM-based methods. Further ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting, highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraceRouter: Robust Safety for Large Foundation Models via Path-Level Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21900v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their capabilities, large foundation models (LFMs) remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Current defenses predominantly rely on the "locality hypothesis", suppressing isolated neurons or features. However, harmful semantics act as distributed, cross-layer circuits, rendering such localized interventions brittle and detrimental to utility. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility. Our code will be publicly released. WARNING: This paper contains unsafe model responses.</p></details> |  |

Early BBO benchmarks are predominantly human-crafted, introducing expert bias and constraining diversity. Automating this design process can relieve the human-in-the-loop burden while enhancing diversity and objectivity. We propose Evolution of Benchmark (EoB), an automated BBO benchmark designer empowered by the large language model (LLM) and its program evolution capability. Specifically, we formulate benchmark design as a bi-objective optimization problem towards maximizing (i) landscape diversity and (ii) algorithm-differentiation ability across a portfolio of BBO solvers. Under this paradigm, EoB iteratively prompts LLM to evolve a population of benchmark programs and employs a reflection-based scheme to co-evolve the landscape and its corresponding program. Comprehensive experiments validate our EoB is a competitive candidate in multi-dimensional usages: 1) Benchmarking BBO algorithms; 2) Training and testing learning-assisted BBO algorithms; 3) Extending proxy for expensive real-world problems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Embodied Task Planning via Graph-Informed Action Generation with Large Lanaguage Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21841v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot reasoning capabilities, their deployment as embodied agents still faces fundamental challenges in long-horizon planning. Unlike open-ended text generation, embodied agents must decompose high-level intent into actionable sub-goals while strictly adhering to the logic of a dynamic, observed environment. Standard LLM planners frequently fail to maintain strategy coherence over extended horizons due to context window limitation or hallucinate transitions that violate constraints. We propose GiG, a novel planning framework that structures embodied agents' memory using a Graph-in-Graph architecture. Our approach employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode environmental states into embeddings, organizing these embeddings into action-connected execution trace graphs within an experience memory bank. By clustering these graph embeddings, the framework enables retrieval of structure-aware priors, allowing agents to ground current decisions in relevant past structural patterns. Furthermore, we introduce a novel bounded lookahead module that leverages symbolic transition logic to enhance the agents' planning capabilities through the grounded action projection. We evaluate our framework on three embodied planning benchmarks-Robotouille Synchronous, Robotouille Asynchronous, and ALFWorld. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving Pass@1 performance gains of up to 22% on Robotouille Synchronous, 37% on Asynchronous, and 15% on ALFWorld with comparable or lower computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mil-SCORE: Benchmarking Long-Context Geospatial Reasoning and Planning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21826v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are applied to increasingly longer and more complex tasks, there is a growing need for realistic long-context benchmarks that require selective reading and integration of heterogeneous, multi-modal information sources. This need is especially acute for geospatial planning problems, such as those found in planning for large-scale military operations, which demand fast and accurate reasoning over maps, orders, intelligence reports, and other distributed data. To address this gap, we present MilSCORE (Military Scenario Contextual Reasoning), to our knowledge the first scenario-level dataset of expert-authored, multi-hop questions grounded in a complex, simulated military planning scenario used for training. MilSCORE is designed to evaluate high-stakes decision-making and planning, probing LLMs' ability to combine tactical and spatial reasoning across multiple sources and to reason over long-horizon, geospatially rich context. The benchmark includes a diverse set of question types across seven categories targeting both factual recall and multi-step reasoning about constraints, strategy, and spatial analysis. We provide an evaluation protocol and report baseline results for a range of contemporary vision-language models. Our findings highlight substantial headroom on MilSCORE, indicating that current systems struggle with realistic, scenario-level long-context planning, and positioning MilSCORE as a challenging testbed for future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[CORE:Toward Ubiquitous 6G Intelligence Through Collaborative Orchestration of Large Language Model Agents Over Hierarchical Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21822v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid advancements in sixth-generation (6G) networks and large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for ubiquitous intelligence, wherein seamless connectivity and distributed artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized various aspects of our lives.However, realizing this vision faces significant challenges owing to the fragmented and heterogeneous computing resources across hierarchical networks, which are insufficient for individual LLM agents to perform complex reasoning tasks.To address this issue, we propose Collaborative Orchestration Role at Edge (CORE), an innovative framework that employs a collaborative learning system in which multiple LLMs, each assigned a distinct functional role, are distributed across mobile devices and tiered edge servers. The system integrates three optimization modules, encompassing real-time perception,dynamic role orchestration, and pipeline-parallel execution, to facilitate efficient and rapid collaboration among distributed agents. Furthermore, we introduce a novel role affinity scheduling algorithm for dynamically orchestrating LLM role assignments across the hierarchical edge infrastructure, intelligently matching computational demands with available dispersed resources.Finally, comprehensive case studies and performance evaluations across various 6G application scenarios demonstrated the efficacy of CORE, revealing significant enhancements in the system efficiency and task completion rates. Building on these promising outcomes, we further validated the practical applicability of CORE by deploying it on a real-world edge-computing platform,that exhibits robust performance in operational environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |
| **[A Judge-Aware Ranking Framework for Evaluating Large Language Models without Ground Truth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21817v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on open-ended tasks without ground-truth labels is increasingly done via the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. A critical but under-modeled issue is that judge LLMs differ substantially in reliability; treating all judges equally can yield biased leaderboards and misleading uncertainty estimates. More data can make evaluation more confidently wrong under misspecified aggregation. We propose a judge-aware ranking framework that extends the Bradley-Terry-Luce model by introducing judge-specific discrimination parameters, jointly estimating latent model quality and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons without reference labels. We establish identifiability up to natural normalizations and prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator, enabling confidence intervals for score differences and rank comparisons. Across multiple public benchmarks and a newly collected dataset, our method improves agreement with human preferences, achieves higher data efficiency than unweighted baselines, and produces calibrated uncertainty quantification for LLM rankings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wikontic: Constructing Wikidata-Aligned, Ontology-Aware Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00590v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs (KGs) provide structured, verifiable grounding for large language models (LLMs), but current LLM-based systems commonly use KGs as auxiliary structures for text retrieval, leaving their intrinsic quality underexplored. In this work, we propose Wikontic, a multi-stage pipeline that constructs KGs from open-domain text by extracting candidate triplets with qualifiers, enforcing Wikidata-based type and relation constraints, and normalizing entities to reduce duplication. The resulting KGs are compact, ontology-consistent, and well-connected; on MuSiQue, the correct answer entity appears in 96% of generated triplets. On HotpotQA, our triplets-only setup achieves 76.0 F1, and on MuSiQue 59.8 F1, matching or surpassing several retrieval-augmented generation baselines that still require textual context. In addition, Wikontic attains state-of-the-art information-retention performance on the MINE-1 benchmark (86%), outperforming prior KG construction methods. Wikontic is also efficient at build time: KG construction uses less than 1,000 output tokens, about 3$\times$ fewer than AriGraph and $<$1/20 of GraphRAG. The proposed pipeline enhances the quality of the generated KG and offers a scalable solution for leveraging structured knowledge in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods compromise by producing either low-resolution meshes or coarse structural proxies, failing to capture fine-grained geometry natively. In this paper, we propose CG-MLLM, a novel Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) capable of 3D captioning and high-resolution 3D generation in a single framework. Leveraging the Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, CG-MLLM decouples disparate modeling needs, where the Token-level Autoregressive (TokenAR) Transformer handles token-level content, and the Block-level Autoregressive (BlockAR) Transformer handles block-level content. By integrating a pre-trained vision-language backbone with a specialized 3D VAE latent space, CG-MLLM facilitates long-context interactions between standard tokens and spatial blocks within a single integrated architecture. Experimental results show that CG-MLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs in generating high-fidelity 3D objects, effectively bringing high-resolution 3D content creation into the mainstream LLM paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Vector Weakening: Efficient Training-free Unlearning for Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21794v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are widely adopted for their strong multimodal capabilities, yet they raise serious concerns such as privacy leakage and harmful content generation. Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for removing the influence of specific data from trained models. However, existing approaches largely rely on gradient-based optimization, incurring substantial computational costs for large-scale LVLMs. To address this limitation, we propose Knowledge Vector Weakening (KVW), a training-free unlearning method that directly intervenes in the full model without gradient computation. KVW identifies knowledge vectors that are activated during the model's output generation on the forget set and progressively weakens their contributions, thereby preventing the model from exploiting undesirable knowledge. Experiments on the MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that KVW achieves a stable forget-retain trade-off while significantly improving computational efficiency over gradient-based and LoRA-based unlearning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing the Business Process Modeling Competences of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21787v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The creation of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) models is a complex and time-consuming task requiring both domain knowledge and proficiency in modeling conventions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly expanded the possibilities for generating BPMN models directly from natural language, building upon earlier text-to-process methods with enhanced capabilities in handling complex descriptions. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluations of LLM-generated process models. Current efforts either use LLM-as-a-judge approaches or do not consider established dimensions of model quality. To this end, we introduce BEF4LLM, a novel LLM evaluation framework comprising four perspectives: syntactic quality, pragmatic quality, semantic quality, and validity. Using BEF4LLM, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of open-source LLMs and benchmark their performance against human modeling experts. Results indicate that LLMs excel in syntactic and pragmatic quality, while humans outperform in semantic aspects; however, the differences in scores are relatively modest, highlighting LLMs' competitive potential despite challenges in validity and semantic quality. The insights highlight current strengths and limitations of using LLMs for BPMN modeling and guide future model development and fine-tuning. Addressing these areas is essential for advancing the practical deployment of LLMs in business process modeling.</p></details> |  |

Developing robust perception algorithms requires large-scale, high-quality datasets that cover diverse driving conditions and support thorough evaluation. Existing datasets often lack a high-fidelity digital twin, limiting systematic testing, edge-case simulation, sensor modification, and sim-to-real evaluations. To address this gap, we present DrivIng, a large-scale multimodal dataset with a complete geo-referenced digital twin of a ~18 km route spanning urban, suburban, and highway segments. Our dataset provides continuous recordings from six RGB cameras, one LiDAR, and high-precision ADMA-based localization, captured across day, dusk, and night. All sequences are annotated at 10 Hz with 3D bounding boxes and track IDs across 12 classes, yielding ~1.2 million annotated instances. Alongside the benefits of a digital twin, DrivIng enables a 1-to-1 transfer of real traffic into simulation, preserving agent interactions while enabling realistic and flexible scenario testing. To support reproducible research and robust validation, we benchmark DrivIng with state-of-the-art perception models and publicly release the dataset, digital twin, HD map, and codebase.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2026 IEEE.

| **[Temporal Guidance for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21744v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Decoding (CD) enhances the generation quality of large language models (LLMs) but incurs significant additional computational overhead due to the need for an auxiliary model. Existing internal self-contrastive decoding methods, such as Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), focus on discrepancies across different layers, which are notably unstable on small-scale models. In this work, based on the observation that LLMs exhibit local preferences, we propose a novel contrastive guidance strategy along the temporal dimension, namely Temporal Guidance (TeGu). Our method ingeniously leverages Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) to construct weaker amateur predictions for model self-contrast. To standardize the implementation of this mechanism, we further introduce a lightweight Conditional MTP Projector (cMTPP), which avoids maintaining multiple independent networks as required by other MTP modules. Across various model series and benchmarks, TeGu achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining low additional memory consumption and computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more attempts are being made to apply LLMs to financial areas. A simple, direct application of LLM as an agent shows significant performance. Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature. Based on the observation found by our investigation, we propose Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a novel framework that decouples LLM features across three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an Hájek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMM over the current distillation method and RL-based market-making strategies.</p></details> | accepted by AAAI2026 |

In this work, we conduct a systematic singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis of principal linear layers in pretrained LLMs, focusing on two widely adopted post-training methods: instruction tuning and long-chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) distillation. Our analysis reveals two unexpected and robust structural changes: (1) a near-uniform geometric scaling of singular values across layers; and (2) highly consistent orthogonal transformations are applied to the left and right singular vectors of each matrix. Based on these findings, We propose a simple yet effective framework to describe the coordinated dynamics of parameters in LLMs, which elucidates why post-training inherently relies on the foundational capabilities developed during pre-training. Further experiments demonstrate that singular value scaling underpins the temperature-controlled regulatory mechanisms of post-training, while the coordinated rotation of singular vectors encodes the essential semantic alignment. These results challenge the prevailing view of the parameter space in large models as a black box, uncovering the first clear regularities in how parameters evolve during training, and providing a new perspective for deeper investigation into model parameter changes.</p></details> |  |

There are a number of lightweight LLMs (e.g., Gemini Nano, LLAMA2 7B) that can run locally on smartphones, providing users with greater control over their personal data. As a rapidly emerging application, we are concerned about their performance on commercial-off-the-shelf mobile devices. To fully understand the current landscape of LLM deployment on mobile platforms, we conduct a comprehensive measurement study on mobile devices. While user experience is the primary concern for end-users, developers focus more on the underlying implementations. Therefore, we evaluate both user-centric metrics-such as token throughput, latency, and response quality-and developer-critical factors, including resource utilization, OS strategies, battery consumption, and launch time. We also provide comprehensive comparisons across the mobile system-on-chips (SoCs) from major vendors, highlighting their performance differences in handling LLM workloads, which may help developers identify and address bottlenecks for mobile LLM applications. We hope that this study can provide insights for both the development of on-device LLMs and the design for future mobile system architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM4Fluid: Large Language Models as Generalizable Neural Solvers for Fluid Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21681v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for spatio-temporal modeling of fluid dynamics. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited generalization to unseen flow conditions and typically require retraining when applied to new scenarios. In this paper, we present LLM4Fluid, a spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics. The framework first compresses high-dimensional flow fields into a compact latent space via reduced-order modeling enhanced with a physics-informed disentanglement mechanism, effectively mitigating spatial feature entanglement while preserving essential flow structures. A pretrained LLM then serves as a temporal processor, autoregressively predicting the dynamics of physical sequences with time series prompts. To bridge the modality gap between prompts and physical sequences, which can otherwise degrade prediction accuracy, we propose a dedicated modality alignment strategy that resolves representational mismatch and stabilizes long-term prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse flow scenarios demonstrate that LLM4Fluid functions as a robust and generalizable neural solver without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while exhibiting powerful zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities. Code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/qisongxiao/LLM4Fluid.</p></details> |  |

However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior. Overall, SONIC-O1 provides an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding. We release SONIC-O1 for reproducibility and research: Project page: https://vectorinstitute.github.io/sonic-o1/ Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/vector-institute/sonic-o1 Github: https://github.com/vectorinstitute/sonic-o1 Leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/vector-institute/sonic-o1-leaderboard</p></details> |  |

Detecting such behavior is challenging due to the difficult-to-annotate training data, its highly covert and multi-turn nature, and the lack of real-world datasets. To address these challenges, we propose MentalMAD, a framework that enhances large language models for mental manipulation detection. Our approach consists of three key components: EvoSA, an annotation-free data augmentation method that combines evolutionary operations with speech-act-aware prompting; teacher-model-generated complementary-task supervision; and Complementary-Convergent Distillation, a phase-wise strategy for transferring manipulation-specific knowledge to student models. We then constructed the ReaMent dataset, comprising 5,000 real-world-sourced dialogues. Extensive experiments show that MentalMAD improves accuracy by 14.0%, macro-F1 by 27.3%, and weighted F1 by 15.1% over the strongest baseline.

This article addresses the floating-point computation of compositionally-rich functions, concentrating on transformer inference. Based on the rounding error analysis of a composition $f(g(\mathrm{x}))$, we provide an adaptive strategy that selects a small subset of components of $g(\mathrm{x})$ to be computed more accurately while all other computations can be carried out with lower accuracy. We then explain how this strategy can be applied to different compositions within a transformer and illustrate its overall effect on transformer inference. We study the effectiveness of this algorithm numerically on GPT-2 models and demonstrate that already very low recomputation rates allow for improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, SFT often leads to sub-optimal performance, while RLVR remains constrained by the model's internal knowledge base. While a sequential SFT $\rightarrow$ RLVR pipeline can be used, it introduces significant computational overhead and suffers from catastrophic forgetting. To address these limitations, we propose ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified, single-stage paradigm that integrates the strengths of both SFT and RLVR. By analyzing their training objectives, we establish a unified framework that injects ground-truth labels directly into RLVR rollouts, facilitating simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we introduce three novel reward control strategies to ensure training stability and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViSurf consistently outperforms standalone SFT, RLVR, and the traditional two-stage pipeline across diverse benchmarks. In-depth analysis corroborates these findings, validating the derivation and design principles of ViSurf.</p></details> |  |

Here, we present TimeSeries2Report (TS2R), a semantic translation framework that converts raw lithium-ion battery operational time-series into structured, semantically enriched reports, enabling LLMs to reason, predict, and make decisions in BESS management scenarios. TS2R encodes short-term temporal dynamics into natural language through a combination of segmentation, semantic abstraction, and rule-based interpretation, effectively bridging low-level sensor signals with high-level contextual insights. We benchmark TS2R across both lab-scale and real-world datasets, evaluating report quality and downstream task performance in anomaly detection, state-of-charge prediction, and charging/discharging management. Compared with vision-, embedding-, and text-based prompting baselines, report-based prompting via TS2R consistently improves LLM performance in terms of across accuracy, robustness, and explainability metrics.

To overcome these limitations, this study proposes TransLaw, a multi-agent framework that decomposes translation into word-level expression, sentence-level translation, and multidimensional review, integrating a specialized Hong Kong legal glossary database, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and iterative feedback. Experiments on our newly constructed HKCFA Judgment 97-22 dataset, benchmarking 13 open-source and commercial LLMs, demonstrate that TransLaw significantly outperforms single-agent baselines across all evaluated models. Human evaluation confirms the framework's effectiveness in terms of legal semantic accuracy, structural coherence, and stylistic fidelity, while noting that it still trails human experts in contextualizing complex terminology and stylistic naturalness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Origi...</summary><p>Original: arXiv:2501.09444; Revised: arXiv:2507.00875; Submitted to ACL 2026</p></details> |
| **[A Comprehensive Evaluation on Quantization Techniques for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17417v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For large language models (LLMs), post-training quantization (PTQ) can significantly reduce memory footprint and computational overhead. Model quantization is rapidly evolving. Though many papers report breakthrough results, they are often evaluated under different settings because a method typically contains multiple components. Analyzing connections among existing methods is important for deeper understanding. To bridge these gaps, we conduct an extensive review of state-of-the-art methods and perform comprehensive evaluations under the same conditions for fair comparison. To our knowledge, such a fair and extensive investigation remains critically underexplored. To better understand connections, first, we decouple published quantization methods into two steps: pre-quantization transformation and quantization error mitigation. The former is a preprocessing step that reduces outlier impact by flattening the data distribution; the latter offsets quantization errors to improve performance. Second, we evaluate and analyze the impact of different settings, including granularity and symmetry. Third, we analyze and evaluate the latest MXFP4 and NVFP4 data formats and their performance. Our experiments first demonstrate that optimized rotation and scaling yield the best pre-quantization performance, and that combining low-rank compensation with GPTQ can occasionally outperform GPTQ alone for error mitigation. Second, finer granularity improves performance but increases storage overhead. Third, we find that scaling-factor format and precision greatly affect FP4 performance, and that rotation-based strategies effective for INT4 offer limited gains for MXFP4 and NVFP4, motivating further study.</p></details> |  |

At its core, modality interference refers to cases where spurious signals from non-essential modalities distort model decisions, which we systematically analyze through causal, perturbation-based diagnostic experiments. To address this problem, we propose a unified finetuning framework that combines heuristic and adversarial perturbation-based data augmentation with output-level consistency regularization between original and perturbed inputs. Extensive experiments across image-heavy, text-heavy, and multimodal benchmarks, spanning multiple MLLM architectures and model scales, demonstrate consistent improvements in unimodal robustness and generalization, while improving standard multimodal performance.</p></details> |  |

However, this AR paradigm inevitably faces a dual efficiency bottleneck: strictly unidirectional attention compromises understanding efficiency by hindering global spatiotemporal aggregation, while serial decoding restricts generation efficiency. To address this, we propose VidLaDA, a Video LLM based on Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) that leverages bidirectional attention to unlock comprehensive spatiotemporal modeling and decode tokens in parallel. To further mitigate the computational overhead of diffusion decoding, we introduce MARS-Cache, an acceleration strategy that prunes redundancy by combining asynchronous visual cache refreshing with frame-wise chunk attention. Experiments show VidLaDA rivals state-of-the-art AR baselines (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA-Video) and outperforms DLM baselines, with MARS-Cache delivering over 12x speedup without compromising accuracy. Code and checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/ziHoHe/VidLaDA.</p></details> |  |

We examine multi-round interactions among LLM agents through the DeGroot framework, where agents exchange text-based messages over diverse communication graphs. To track opinion evolution, we map each message to an opinion score via sentiment analysis. We find that agents typically reach consensus and the disagreement between the agents decays exponentially. However, the limiting opinion departs from DeGroot's network-centrality-weighted forecast. The consensus between LLM agents turns out to be largely insensitive to initial conditions and instead depends strongly on the discussion subject and inherent biases. Nevertheless, transient dynamics align with classical graph theory and the convergence rate of opinions is closely related to the second-largest eigenvalue of the graph's combination matrix. Together, these findings can be useful for LLM-driven social-network simulations and the design of resource-efficient multi-agent LLM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

We show that existing encoder-based attacks can substantially overestimate the robustness of compressed LVLMs, due to an optimization-inference mismatch: perturbations are optimized on the full-token representation, while inference is performed through a token-compression bottleneck. To address this gap, we propose the Compression-AliGnEd attack (CAGE), which aligns perturbation optimization with compression inference without assuming access to the deployed compression mechanism or its token budget. CAGE combines (i) expected feature disruption, which concentrates distortion on tokens likely to survive across plausible budgets, and (ii) rank distortion alignment, which actively aligns token distortions with rank scores to promote the retention of highly distorted evidence. Across diverse representative plug-and-play compression mechanisms and datasets, our results show that CAGE consistently achieves lower robust accuracy than the baseline. This work highlights that robustness assessments ignoring compression can be overly optimistic, calling for compression-aware security evaluation and defenses for efficient LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review, 20 pages</p></details> |

At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent. Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval demonstrate that ReD substantially reduces the required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach a desired coverage, while also offering an efficient way to measure inference power-laws.</p></details> |  |

Yet, large-scale lexical datasets linking Arabic words to precise definitions remain limited. We present MURAD (Multi-domain Unified Reverse Arabic Dictionary), an open lexical dataset with 96,243 word-definition pairs. The data come from trusted reference works and educational sources. Extraction used a hybrid pipeline integrating direct text parsing, optical character recognition, and automated reconstruction. This ensures accuracy and clarity. Each record aligns a target word with its standardized Arabic definition and metadata that identifies the source domain. The dataset covers terms from linguistics, Islamic studies, mathematics, physics, psychology, and engineering. It supports computational linguistics and lexicographic research. Applications include reverse dictionary modeling, semantic retrieval, and educational tools. By releasing this resource, we aim to advance Arabic natural language processing and promote reproducible research on Arabic lexical semantics.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[The Effectiveness of Style Vectors for Steering Large Language Models: A Human Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21505v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling the behavior of large language models (LLMs) at inference time is essential for aligning outputs with human abilities and safety requirements. \emph{Activation steering} provides a lightweight alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning by directly modifying internal activations to guide generation. This research advances the literature in three significant directions. First, while previous work demonstrated the technical feasibility of steering emotional tone using automated classifiers, this paper presents the first human evaluation of activation steering concerning the emotional tone of LLM outputs, collecting over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants via Prolific ($n=190$). These ratings assess both perceived emotional intensity and overall text quality. Second, we find strong alignment between human and model-based quality ratings (mean $r=0.776$, range $0.157$--$0.985$), indicating automatic scoring can proxy perceived quality. Moderate steering strengths ($λ\approx 0.15$) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility, with the strongest effects for disgust ($η_p^2 = 0.616$) and fear ($η_p^2 = 0.540$), and minimal effects for surprise ($η_p^2 = 0.042$). Finally, upgrading from Alpaca to LlaMA-3 yielded more consistent steering with significant effects across emotions and strengths (all $p < 0.001$). Inter-rater reliability was high (ICC $= 0.71$--$0.87$), underscoring the robustness of the findings. These findings support activation-based control as a scalable method for steering LLM behavior across affective dimensions.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose Module-aware Architecture Refinement (MAR), a two-stage framework that integrates State Space Models (SSMs) for linear-time sequence modeling and applies activation sparsification to reduce FFN costs. In addition, to mitigate low information density and temporal mismatch in integrating Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with SSMs, we design the Adaptive Ternary Multi-step Neuron (ATMN) and the Spike-aware Bidirectional Distillation Strategy (SBDS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAR effectively restores the performance of its dense counterpart under constrained resources while substantially reducing inference energy consumption. Furthermore, it outperforms efficient models of comparable or even larger scale, underscoring its potential for building efficient and practical LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2026. 5 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

Each agent maintains private GPU-resident states, including models, prefix caches, and adapters, which quickly exhaust device memory as the agent count grows. We identify two key properties of these workloads: sparse agent activation and an estimable agent invocation order. Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations. ScaleSim enables proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface, and achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[L$^3$: Large Lookup Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21461v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern sparse language models typically achieve sparsity through Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers, which dynamically route tokens to dense MLP "experts." However, dynamic hard routing has a number of drawbacks, such as potentially poor hardware efficiency and needing auxiliary losses for stable training. In contrast, the tokenizer embedding table, which is natively sparse, largely avoids these issues by selecting a single embedding per token at the cost of not having contextual information. In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality. We empirically test L$^3$ by training transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters and find that L$^3$ strongly outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in both language modeling and downstream tasks.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, the deep-thinking mode often leads to unnecessarily lengthy reasoning and resource inefficiency when handling simple tasks. This overthinking phenomenon may arise from the generation preference triggered by the reward function during post-training. Existing research attempts to mitigate overthinking from the perspective of prompt design or model training, but generally underestimates the importance of task difficulty awareness, which makes it difficult for LRMs to effectively allocate reasoning resources. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-aware Policy Optimization (DiPO), a reinforcement learning-based LRM training framework. DiPO encourages LRM to spontaneously model task complexity, and integrates them into reinforcement learning framework to adjust the generation preferences introduced by post-training. A difficulty modeling method based on model self-reasoning is proposed, which significantly reduces the dependence on manual annotation and formalize task complexity. We further develop a difficulty-signal-enhanced reward function that incorporates a penalty for lengthy reasoning while considering reasoning performance and output format. Experimental results indicate that DiPO enables the model to spontaneously adjust inference overhead, significantly reducing redundant tokens without losing performance due to thought compression.</p></details> |  |

To address this question, for the first time, we evaluate comprehensively the capacity of popular LLMs for successfully predicting continuous affect annotations of videos when prompted by a sequence of text and video frames in a multimodal fashion. In this paper, we test LLMs' ability to correctly label changes of in-game engagement in 80 minutes of annotated videogame footage from 20 first-person shooter games of the GameVibe corpus. We run over 4,800 experiments to investigate the impact of LLM architecture, model size, input modality, prompting strategy, and ground truth processing method on engagement prediction. Our findings suggest that while LLMs rightfully claim human-like performance across multiple domains and able to outperform traditional machine learning baselines, they generally fall behind continuous experience annotations provided by humans. We examine some of the underlying causes for a fluctuating performance across games, highlight the cases where LLMs exceed expectations, and draw a roadmap for the further exploration of automated emotion labelling via LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for publication</p></details> |

Existing benchmarks mainly focus on problem-solving or problem-level guidance, leaving knowledge-centered teaching underexplored. We propose a syllabus-grounded evaluation framework that measures LLM teaching capability via student performance improvement after multi-turn instruction. By restricting teacher agents to structured knowledge points and example problems, the framework avoids information leakage and enables reuse of existing benchmarks. We instantiate the framework on Gaokao data across multiple subjects. Experiments reveal substantial variation in teaching effectiveness across models and domains: some models perform well in mathematics, while teaching remains challenging in physics and chemistry. We also find that incorporating example problems does not necessarily improve teaching, as models often shift toward example-specific error correction. Overall, our results highlight teaching ability as a distinct and measurable dimension of LLM behavior.</p></details> |  |

Prior studies show that English-centric large language models map multilingual content into English-aligned representations at intermediate layers and then project them back into target-language token spaces in the final layer. From this observation, we hypothesize that this cross-lingual transition is governed by a small and sparse set of dimensions, which occur at consistent indices across the intermediate to final layers. Building on this insight, we introduce a simple, training-free method to identify and manipulate these dimensions, requiring only as few as 50 sentences of either parallel or monolingual data. Experiments on a multilingual generation control task reveal the interpretability of these dimensions, demonstrating that the interventions in these dimensions can switch the output language while preserving semantic content, and that it surpasses the performance of prior neuron-based approaches at a substantially lower cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EACL 2026 (Main).

| **[Towards Bridging the Gap between Large-Scale Pretraining and Efficient Finetuning for Humanoid Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21363v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for humanoid control, with on-policy methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) enabling robust training via large-scale parallel simulation and, in some cases, zero-shot deployment to real robots. However, the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms limits safe adaptation to new environments. Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model. This separation mitigates the risks of random exploration during adaptation while preserving exploratory coverage for improvement. Overall, the approach couples the wall-clock efficiency of large-scale simulation during pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

However, long-horizon EHRs often exceed LLM context limits, and existing approaches commonly rely on truncation or vanilla retrieval strategies that discard clinically relevant events and temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%. Overall, our work highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented LLMs to advance clinical prediction on structured EHR data in practice.</p></details> |  |

Existing work has primarily focused on studying scaling laws for pretraining (upstream) loss. However, in transfer learning settings, in which LLMs are pretrained on an unsupervised dataset and then finetuned on a downstream task, we often also care about the downstream performance. In this work, we study the scaling behavior in a transfer learning setting, where LLMs are finetuned for machine translation tasks. Specifically, we investigate how the choice of the pretraining data and its size affect downstream performance (translation quality) as judged by: downstream cross-entropy and translation quality metrics such as BLEU and COMET scores. Our experiments indicate that the size of the finetuning dataset and the distribution alignment between the pretraining and downstream data significantly influence the scaling behavior. With sufficient alignment, both downstream cross-entropy and translation quality scores improve monotonically with more pretraining data. In such cases, we show that it is possible to predict the downstream translation quality metrics with good accuracy using a log-law. However, there are cases where moderate misalignment causes the downstream translation scores to fluctuate or get worse with more pretraining, whereas downstream cross-entropy monotonically improves. By analyzing these, we provide new practical insights for choosing appropriate pretraining data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025, with title: "Scaling Laws for Downstream Task Performance in Machine Translation"</p></details> |

In response, we leverage the strong transfer and generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance. Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary counterparts.</p></details> |  |

However, the advent of large-scale recommenders also brings significantly higher computational costs, particularly under the long-sequence dependencies inherent in the user intent of recommendation systems. Current approaches often rely on pre-storing the intermediate states of the past behavior for each user, thereby reducing the quadratic re-computation cost for the following requests. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often treat memory merely as a medium for acceleration, without adequately considering the space overhead it introduces. This presents a critical challenge in real-world recommendation systems with billions of users, each of whom might initiate thousands of interactions and require massive memory for state storage. Fortunately, there have been several memory management strategies examined for compression in LLM, while most have not been evaluated on the recommendation task. To mitigate this gap, we introduce MALLOC, a comprehensive benchmark for memory-aware long sequence compression. MALLOC presents a comprehensive investigation and systematic classification of memory management techniques applicable to large sequential recommendations. These techniques are integrated into state-of-the-art recommenders, enabling a reproducible and accessible evaluation platform. Through extensive experiments across accuracy, efficiency, and complexity, we demonstrate the holistic reliability of MALLOC in advancing large-scale recommendation.

However, the complex mechanisms that link neuron's functional co-activation with the emergent model capabilities remains largely unknown, hindering a deeper understanding and safer development of LLMs. In this work, we introduce graph probing, a method for uncovering the functional connectivity of LLM neurons and relating it to language generation performance. By probing models across diverse LLM families and scales, we discover a universal predictability of language generation and understanding performance using only neural topology, which persists even when retaining just 1% of neuron connections. Strikingly, probing on topology outperforms probing on activation by up to 130.4% and 67.7% on perplexity and space/time semantic regression respectively, suggesting that neural topology contains orders of richer information of LLM performance than neural activation, which can be easily extracted with simple linear or MLP probes. To explain the dependence between neural topology and language performance, we identify default networks and hub neurons in LLMs and provide causal evidence by interventional experiments on multiple benchmarks, showing that LLMs actually exploit these topological information. Further analyses suggest that graph probing can be effectively leveraged to improve the efficiency and reliability of LLMs through proof-of-concept applications in model pruning and hallucination detection. Codes and data for the graph probing toolbox are available at https://github.com/DavyMorgan/llm-graph-probing.</p></details> |  |

However, prevailing evaluation benchmarks often reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, thereby obscuring distributional structure, cross-dimensional interactions, and worst-case behavior. This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre P...</summary><p>Pre Print, 29 pages. key words: Social harm evaluation in LLMs, Large language models, Risk sensitive model selection, Evaluation for high-stakes domains, Worst-case behavior in LLMs, Algorithmic bias, Fairness in machine learning</p></details> |

As a result, they can generate factually incorrect responses on topics they do not have enough knowledge of, commonly known as hallucination. Rather than hallucinating, a language model should be more honest and respond with "I don't know" when it does not have enough knowledge about a topic. Many methods have been proposed to improve LLM honesty, but their evaluations lack robustness, as they do not take into account the knowledge that the LLM has ingested during its pretraining. In this paper, we propose a more robust evaluation benchmark dataset for LLM honesty by utilizing Pythia, a truly open LLM with publicly available pretraining data. In addition, we also propose a novel method for harnessing the pretraining data to build a more honest LLM.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies reveal a sharp performance drop in reasoning hop generalization scenarios, where the required number of reasoning steps exceeds training distributions while the underlying algorithm remains unchanged. The internal mechanisms driving this failure remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on tasks from multiple domains, and find that errors concentrate at token positions of a few critical error types, rather than being uniformly distributed. Closer inspection reveals that these token-level erroneous predictions stem from internal competition mechanisms: certain attention heads, termed erroneous processing heads (ep heads), tip the balance by amplifying incorrect reasoning trajectories while suppressing correct ones. Notably, removing individual ep heads during inference can often restore the correct predictions. Motivated by these insights, we propose test-time correction of reasoning, a lightweight intervention method that dynamically identifies and deactivates ep heads in the reasoning process. Extensive experiments across different tasks and LLMs show that it consistently improves reasoning hop generalization, highlighting both its effectiveness and potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 pa...</summary><p>52 pages, accepted by ICLR 2026 main conference</p></details> |

Current planning methods heavily rely on human experts, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, or utilize deep learning algorithms, often limiting stakeholder involvement. To bridge these gaps, we propose Intelli-Planner, a novel framework integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate participatory and customized planning scheme generation. Intelli-Planner utilizes demographic, geographic data, and planning preferences to determine high-level planning requirements and demands for each functional type. During training, a knowledge enhancement module is employed to enhance the decision-making capability of the policy network. Additionally, we establish a multi-dimensional evaluation system and employ LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring. Experimental validation across diverse urban settings shows that Intelli-Planner surpasses traditional baselines and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL-based methods in objective metrics, while enhancing stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed. These findings underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our framework, highlighting the potential for integrating the latest advancements in LLMs with DRL approaches to revolutionize tasks related to functional areas planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>The W...</summary><p>The Web Conference 2026</p></details> |

While LLMs are known to generate samples that approximate real-world distributions, whether their fine-grained sampling probabilities faithfully align with task requirements remains an open question. Through controlled distribution-sampling simulations, we uncover a striking dichotomy in LLM behavior, distinguishing two model types: D-models (e.g. Qwen-2.5), whose P_token exhibits large step-to-step variability and poor alignment with P_task; and E-models (e.g. Mistral-Small), whose P_token is more stable and better aligned with P_task. We further evaluate these two model types in downstream tasks such as code generation and recommendation, revealing systematic trade-offs between diversity and stability that shape task outcomes. Finally, we analyze the internal properties of both model families to probe their underlying mechanisms. These findings offer foundational insights into the probabilistic sampling behavior of LLMs and provide practical guidance on when to favor D- versus E-models. For web-scale applications, including recommendation, search, and conversational agents, our results inform model selection and configuration to balance diversity with reliability under real-world uncertainty, providing a better level of interpretation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures.

| **[Evaluating Large Language Models for Time Series Anomaly Detection in Aerospace Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12448v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of aerospace software systems. Although large language models (LLMs) provide a promising training-free alternative to unsupervised approaches, their effectiveness in aerospace settings remains under-examined because of complex telemetry, misaligned evaluation metrics, and the absence of domain knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce ATSADBench, the first benchmark for aerospace TSAD. ATSADBench comprises nine tasks that combine three pattern-wise anomaly types, univariate and multivariate signals, and both in-loop and out-of-loop feedback scenarios, yielding 108,000 data points. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under two paradigms: Direct, which labels anomalies within sliding windows, and Prediction-Based, which detects anomalies from prediction errors. To reflect operational needs, we reformulate evaluation at the window level and propose three user-oriented metrics: Alarm Accuracy (AA), Alarm Latency (AL), and Alarm Contiguity (AC), which quantify alarm correctness, timeliness, and credibility. We further examine two enhancement strategies, few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), to inject domain knowledge. The evaluation results show that (1) LLMs perform well on univariate tasks but struggle with multivariate telemetry, (2) their AA and AC on multivariate tasks approach random guessing, (3) few-shot learning provides modest gains whereas RAG offers no significant improvement, and (4) in practice LLMs can detect true anomaly onsets yet sometimes raise false alarms, which few-shot prompting mitigates but RAG exacerbates. These findings offer guidance for future LLM-based TSAD in aerospace software.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ASE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Refine-POI: Reinforcement Fine-Tuned Large Language Models for Next Point-of-Interest Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21599v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancing large language models (LLMs) for the next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task faces two fundamental challenges: (i) although existing methods produce semantic IDs that incorporate semantic information, their topology-blind indexing fails to preserve semantic continuity, meaning that proximity in ID values does not mirror the coherence of the underlying semantics; and (ii) supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based methods restrict model outputs to top-1 predictions. These approaches suffer from "answer fixation" and neglect the need for top-k ranked lists and reasoning due to the scarcity of supervision. We propose Refine-POI, a framework that addresses these challenges through topology-aware ID generation and reinforcement fine-tuning. First, we introduce a hierarchical self-organizing map (SOM) quantization strategy to generate semantic IDs, ensuring that coordinate proximity in the codebook reflects semantic similarity in the latent space. Second, we employ a policy-gradient framework to optimize the generation of top-k recommendation lists, liberating the model from strict label matching. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that Refine-POI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively synthesizing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the representational fidelity required for accurate and explainable next-POI recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAD: Modality-Adaptive Decoding for Mitigating Cross-Modal Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21181v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\% and 2.0\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\% and 4.7\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

Using stratified samples from Florida and North Carolina voter files with self-reported race, LLM-based classification achieves up to 84.7% accuracy, outperforming BISG (68.2%) on balanced samples. I test six models including Gemini 3 Flash, GPT-4o, and open-source alternatives such as DeepSeek v3.2 and GLM-4.7. Enabling extended reasoning can improve accuracy by 1-3 percentage points, though effects vary across contexts; including metadata such as party registration reaches 86.7%. LLM classification also reduces the income bias inherent in BISG, where minorities in wealthier neighborhoods are systematically misclassified as White. I further validate using Lebanese voter registration with religious sect (64.3% accuracy), Indian MPs from reserved constituencies (99.2%), and Indian land records with caste classification (74.0%). Aggregate validation across India, Uganda, Nepal, Armenia, Chile, and Costa Rica using original full-count voter rolls demonstrates that the method recovers known population distributions where naming conventions are distinctive. For large-scale applications, small transformer models fine-tuned on LLM labels exceed BISG accuracy while enabling local deployment at no cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hierarchical Imprecise Probability Approach to Reliability Assessment of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00527v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, raising the need for rigorous reliability assessment methods. Existing benchmark-based evaluations primarily offer descriptive statistics of model accuracy over datasets, providing limited insight into the probabilistic behavior of LLMs under real operational conditions. This paper introduces HIP-LLM, a Hierarchical Imprecise Probability framework for modeling and inferring LLM reliability. Building upon the foundations of software reliability engineering, HIP-LLM defines LLM reliability as the probability of failure-free operation over a specified number of future tasks under a given Operational Profile (OP). HIP-LLM represents dependencies across (sub-)domains hierarchically, enabling multi-level inference from subdomain to system-level reliability. HIP-LLM embeds imprecise priors to capture epistemic uncertainty and incorporates OPs to reflect usage contexts. It derives posterior reliability envelopes that quantify uncertainty across priors and data. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIP-LLM offers a more accurate and standardized reliability characterization than existing benchmark and state-of-the-art approaches. A publicly accessible repository of HIP-LLM is provided.</p></details> | under review |

Evaluating Large Language Models for Policymaking to Alleviate Homelessness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03827v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes domains. Their potential to encode evolving social contexts and to generate plausible scenarios position them as promising tools in social policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs are aligned with domain experts (and among themselves) on policy recommendations to alleviate homelessness - a challenge affecting over 150 million people worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios across four cities, with policy choices that are grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the policies to an agent-based model in one location, and compare the social impact of the policies recommended by LLMs to those recommended by experts. Our exploratory analysis reveals variation across LLMs in their policy recommendations compared to local experts, yet suggests potential benefits of the use of LLMs to provide insights for policymaking, if paired with responsible guardrails, contextual calibrations, and local domain expertise. Our work operationalizes the Capability Approach in a computational framework and provides new insights on homelessness alleviation policymaking with a focus on human dignity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added a 2nd expert's local-scenario annotations (Table 1 updated with inter-expert consensus); strengthened motivation & domain-expert engagement; expanded related work; replaced ROUGE-L with Sentence-BERT semantic similarity for justification analysis; clarified evaluation non-circularity (Sec. 4.1); deepened results analysis (local context responsiveness/bias); refined limitations & future work</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models for Detecting Cyberattacks on Smart Grid Protective Relays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04443v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a large language model (LLM)-based framework that adapts and fine-tunes compact LLMs for detecting cyberattacks on transformer current differential relays (TCDRs), which can otherwise cause false tripping of critical power transformers. The core idea is to textualize multivariate time-series current measurements from TCDRs, across phases and input/output sides, into structured natural-language prompts that are then processed by compact, locally deployable LLMs. Using this representation, we fine-tune DistilBERT, GPT-2, and DistilBERT+LoRA to distinguish cyberattacks from genuine fault-induced disturbances while preserving relay dependability. The proposed framework is evaluated against a broad set of state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning baselines under nominal conditions, complex cyberattack scenarios, and measurement noise. Our results show that LLM-based detectors achieve competitive or superior cyberattack detection performance, with DistilBERT detecting up to 97.62% of attacks while maintaining perfect fault detection accuracy. Additional evaluations demonstrate robustness to prompt formulation variations, resilience under combined time-synchronization and false-data injection attacks, and stable performance under realistic measurement noise levels. The attention mechanisms of LLMs further enable intrinsic interpretability by highlighting the most influential time-phase regions of relay measurements. These results demonstrate that compact LLMs provide a practical, interpretable, and robust solution for enhancing cyberattack detection in modern digital substations. We provide the full dataset used in this study for reproducibility.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Bayesian-LoRA, which reformulates the deterministic LoRA update as a probabilistic low-rank representation inspired by Sparse Gaussian Processes. We identify a structural isomorphism between LoRA's factorization and Kronecker-factored SGP posteriors, and show that LoRA emerges as a limiting case when posterior uncertainty collapses. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLM architectures across commonsense reasoning benchmarks. With only approximately 0.42M additional parameters and ${\approx}1.2{\times}$ training cost relative to standard LoRA, Bayesian-LoRA significantly improves calibration across models up to 30B, achieving up to 84% ECE reduction and 76% NLL reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OoD) evaluations.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prompting and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Rec-R1 directly optimizes LLM generation using feedback from a fixed black-box recommendation model, without relying on synthetic SFT data from proprietary models such as GPT-4o. This avoids the substantial cost and effort required for data distillation. To verify the effectiveness of Rec-R1, we evaluate it on two representative tasks: product search and sequential recommendation. Experimental results demonstrate that Rec-R1 not only consistently outperforms prompting- and SFT-based methods, but also achieves significant gains over strong discriminative baselines, even when used with simple retrievers such as BM25. Moreover, Rec-R1 preserves the general-purpose capabilities of the LLM, unlike SFT, which often impairs instruction-following and reasoning. These findings suggest Rec-R1 as a promising foundation for continual task-specific adaptation without catastrophic forgetting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the TMLR journal</p></details> |

We present a speciated quality-diversity (QD) extension of ToxSearch that maintains multiple high-toxicity prompt niches in parallel rather than optimizing a single best prompt. ToxSearch-S introduces unsupervised prompt speciation via a search methodology that maintains capacity-limited species with exemplar leaders, a reserve pool for outliers and emerging niches, and species-aware parent selection that trades off within-niche exploitation and cross-niche exploration. ToxSearch-S is found to reach higher peak toxicity ($\approx 0.73$ vs.\ $\approx 0.47$) and a extreme heavier tail (top-10 median $0.66$ vs.\ $0.45$) than the baseline, while maintaining comparable performance on moderately toxic prompts. Speciation also yields broader semantic coverage under a topic-as-species analysis (higher effective topic diversity $N_1$ and larger unique topic coverage $K$). Finally, species formed are well-separated in embedding space (mean separation ratio $\approx 1.93$) and exhibit distinct toxicity distributions, indicating that speciation partitions the adversarial space into behaviorally differentiated niches rather than superficial lexical variants. This suggests our approach uncovers a wider range of attack strategies.</p></details> | Preprint. 12 pages |

In this work, we provide a systematic assessment of the planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We propose a novel benchmark based on Sokoban puzzles, intentionally simplified to isolate long-horizon planning from state persistence. Our findings reveal a consistent degradation in planning performance when more than 25 moves are required to reach the solution, suggesting a fundamental constraint on forward planning capacity. We show that equipping LRMs with Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) parsing, validation, and solving tools allows for modest improvements, suggesting inherent architectural limitations which might not be overcome by test-time scaling approaches alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProToken: Token-Level Attribution for Federated Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19672v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of Large Language Models (LLMs) across distributed data sources while preserving privacy. However, when federated LLMs are deployed in critical applications, it remains unclear which client(s) contributed to specific generated responses, hindering debugging, malicious client identification, fair reward allocation, and trust verification. We present ProToken, a novel Provenance methodology for Token-level attribution in federated LLMs that addresses client attribution during autoregressive text generation while maintaining FL privacy constraints. ProToken leverages two key insights to enable provenance at each token: (1) transformer architectures concentrate task-specific signals in later blocks, enabling strategic layer selection for computational tractability, and (2) gradient-based relevance weighting filters out irrelevant neural activations, focusing attribution on neurons that directly influence token generation. We evaluate ProToken across 16 configurations spanning four LLM architectures (Gemma, Llama, Qwen, SmolLM) and four domains (medical, financial, mathematical, coding). ProToken achieves 98% average attribution accuracy in correctly localizing responsible client(s), and maintains high accuracy when the number of clients are scaled, validating its practical viability for real-world deployment settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[The neural networks with tensor weights and emergent fermionic Wick rules in the large-width limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05303v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study complex-valued neural network (CVNNs) with tensor-valued hidden-to-output weights within the framework of neural-network quantum field theory (NN-QFT). For standard CVNNs with scalar weights, we derive the generating functional and identify the exact Gaussian process that arises in the infinite-width limit, together with its associated effective quantum state. When the last-layer weights are promoted to Clifford-algebra-valued tensors, the network output becomes complex matrix-valued, and a fermion-like sign structure in the large-width correlation functions of the network output is induced. We show that, in the infinite-width limit, correlators with equal numbers of $f^†$ and $f$ obey fermionic Wick rules and can be written as determinants built from a scalar Euclidean kernel $S(x,y)=\langle f^†(x)f(y)\rangle$. This provides a sign-structured extension of NN-QFT at the level of Euclidean correlators and Feynman rules, even though a microscopic Grassmann path integral representation for the network parameters has not yet been constructed. Our analysis thus pushes the NN-QFT correspondence beyond purely bosonic Gaussian fields and suggests a possible route to encoding fermion-like symmetries in neural architectures for QFT correspondence.</p></details> |  |

Yet accountability remains fragile because process transparency is rarely recorded in a durable and reviewable form. We propose LLM audit trails as a sociotechnical mechanism for continuous accountability. An audit trail is a chronological, tamper-evident, context-rich ledger of lifecycle events and decisions that links technical provenance (models, data, training and evaluation runs, deployments, monitoring) with governance records (approvals, waivers, and attestations), so organizations can reconstruct what changed, when, and who authorized it. This paper contributes: (1) a lifecycle framework that specifies event types, required metadata, and governance rationales; (2) a reference architecture with lightweight emitters, append only audit stores, and an auditor interface supporting cross organizational traceability; and (3) a reusable, open-source Python implementation that instantiates this audit layer in LLM workflows with minimal integration effort. We conclude by discussing limitations and directions for adoption.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we presented a flexible evaluation framework that automatically generates synthetic question and answer pairs tailored to the characteristics of each dataset or task. Experiments were conducted on a curated subset of MIMIC III, (four structured tables and one clinical note type), using a mix of locally hosted and API-based LLMs. Evaluation combined exact-match metrics, semantic similarity, and human judgment. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to support precise querying and accurate information extraction in clinical workflows.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

This paper introduces OnePiece, a large-scale distributed inference system with RDMA optimized for multi-stage AIGC workflows. By decomposing pipelines into fine-grained microservices and leveraging one-sided RDMA communication, OnePiece significantly reduces inter-node latency and CPU overhead while improving GPU utilization. The system incorporates a novel double-ring buffer design to resolve deadlocks in RDMA-aware memory access without CPU involvement. Additionally, a dynamic Node Manager allocates resources elastically across workflow stages in response to real-time load. Experimental results demonstrate that OnePiece reduces GPU resource consumption by 16x in Wan2.1 image-to-video generation compared to monolithic inference pipelines, offering a scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient solution for production AIGC environments.</p></details> | 12 pages |

These models are typically built upon multi-step frameworks like diffusion and flow matching, which inherently limits their inference efficiency (requiring 40-100 Number of Function Evaluations (NFEs)). While various few-step methods aim to accelerate the inference, existing solutions have clear limitations. Prominent distillation-based methods, such as progressive and consistency distillation, either require an iterative distillation procedure or show significant degradation at very few steps (< 4-NFE). Meanwhile, integrating adversarial training into distillation (e.g., DMD/DMD2 and SANA-Sprint) to enhance performance introduces training instability, added complexity, and high GPU memory overhead due to the auxiliary trained models. To this end, we propose TwinFlow, a simple yet effective framework for training 1-step generative models that bypasses the need of fixed pretrained teacher models and avoids standard adversarial networks during training, making it ideal for building large-scale, efficient models. On text-to-image tasks, our method achieves a GenEval score of 0.83 in 1-NFE, outperforming strong baselines like SANA-Sprint (a GAN loss-based framework) and RCGM (a consistency-based framework). Notably, we demonstrate the scalability of TwinFlow by full-parameter training on Qwen-Image-20B and transform it into an efficient few-step generator. With just 1-NFE, our approach matches the performance of the original 100-NFE model on both the GenEval and DPG-Bench benchmarks, reducing computational cost by $100\times$ with minor quality degradation.

Given their potential to replace existing forms of knowledge acquisition, this poses a risk of knowledge collapse, where homogenous LLMs may lead most people to be exposed to largely the same information, thus mediating a shrinking in the range of accessible information over time as underepresented knowledge is forgotten. To assess the risk of knowledge collapse with LLMs, we present a new methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world claims in LLM outputs. We use this to perform a broad empirical study testing 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200 prompt templates sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, all models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search. We find that model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity, while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though the improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context. Finally, compared to a traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia), we find that country-specific claims reflect the English language more than the local one, highlighting a gap in epistemic representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages; 8 figures, 4 tables; v2 changelog: Fixed the modeling for table 3, random effect is the model version; v3 changelog: Fixed minor formatting issues in tables 2 and 3; v4 changelog: Fixed some typos and model description; v5 changelog: Updated metadata; v6 changelog: Improved search baseline, writing revisions, added comparisons to semantic similarity only approaches</p></details> |

However, previous assessments of the creative capabilities of LLMs remain weakly grounded in human creativity theory and are thus hard to interpret. The widely used Divergent Association Task (DAT) focuses on novelty, ignoring appropriateness, a core component of creativity. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art LLMs on DAT and show that their scores on the task are lower than those of two baselines that do not possess any creative abilities, undermining its validity for model evaluation. Grounded in human creativity theory, which defines creativity as the combination of novelty and appropriateness, we introduce Conditional Divergent Association Task (CDAT). CDAT evaluates novelty conditional on contextual appropriateness, separating noise from creativity better than DAT, while remaining simple and objective. Under CDAT, smaller model families often show the most creativity, whereas advanced families favor appropriateness at lower novelty. We hypothesize that training and alignment likely shift models along this frontier, making outputs more appropriate but less creative. We release the dataset and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EACL 2026</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Missing Modality Completion in Product Catalogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19750v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing-modality information on e-commerce platforms, such as absent product images or textual descriptions, often arises from annotation errors or incomplete metadata, impairing both product presentation and downstream applications such as recommendation systems. Motivated by the multimodal generative capabilities of recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), this work investigates a fundamental yet underexplored question: can MLLMs generate missing modalities for products in e-commerce scenarios? We propose the Missing Modality Product Completion Benchmark (MMPCBench), which consists of two sub-benchmarks: a Content Quality Completion Benchmark and a Recommendation Benchmark. We further evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs from the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3 model families across nine real-world e-commerce categories, focusing on image-to-text and text-to-image completion tasks. Experimental results show that while MLLMs can capture high-level semantics, they struggle with fine-grained word-level and pixel- or patch-level alignment. In addition, performance varies substantially across product categories and model scales, and we observe no trivial correlation between model size and performance, in contrast to trends commonly reported in mainstream benchmarks. We also explore Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to better align MLLMs with this task. GRPO improves image-to-text completion but does not yield gains for text-to-image completion. Overall, these findings expose the limitations of current MLLMs in real-world cross-modal generation and represent an early step toward more effective missing-modality product completion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparsity-Aware Low-Rank Representation for Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16991v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting large pre-trained language models to downstream tasks often entails fine-tuning millions of parameters or deploying costly dense weight updates, which hinders their use in resource-constrained environments. Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduces trainable parameters by factorizing weight updates, yet the underlying dense weights still impose high storage and computation costs. Magnitude-based pruning can yield sparse models but typically degrades LoRA's performance when applied naively. In this paper, we introduce SALR (Sparsity-Aware Low-Rank Representation), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that unifies low-rank adaptation with sparse pruning under a rigorous mean-squared-error framework. We prove that statically pruning only the frozen base weights minimizes the pruning error bound, and we recover the discarded residual information via a truncated-SVD low-rank adapter, which provably reduces per-entry MSE by a factor of $(1 - r/\min(d,k))$. To maximize hardware efficiency, we fuse multiple low-rank adapters into a single concatenated GEMM, and we adopt a bitmap-based encoding with a two-stage pipelined decoding + GEMM design to achieve true model compression and speedup. Empirically, SALR attains 50\% sparsity on various LLMs while matching the performance of LoRA on GSM8K and MMLU, reduces model size by $2\times$, and delivers up to a $1.7\times$ inference speedup.</p></details> |  |

While existing KV cache compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this, we propose MixKV, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. MixKV adapts to head-wise semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MixKV consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme compression (budget=64), MixKV improves baseline methods by an average of 5.1% across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves remarkable gains of 8.0% and 9.0% for SnapKV and AdaKV on GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency. Furthermore, MixKV extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable performance gains.

We propose a novel Reinforcement Learning approach that allows to directly fine-tune LLMs to express calibrated confidence estimates alongside their answers to factual questions. Our method optimizes a reward based on the logarithmic scoring rule, explicitly penalizing both over- and under-confidence. This encourages the model to align its confidence estimates with the actual predictive accuracy. The optimal policy under our reward design would result in perfectly calibrated confidence expressions. Unlike prior approaches that decouple confidence estimation from response generation, our method integrates confidence calibration seamlessly into the generative process of the LLM. Empirically, we demonstrate that models trained with our approach exhibit substantially improved calibration and generalize to unseen tasks without further fine-tuning, suggesting the emergence of general confidence awareness.</p></details> |  |
| **[RxnBench: A Multimodal Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models on Chemical Reaction Understanding from Scientific Literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23565v5)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into chemistry promises to revolutionize scientific discovery, yet their ability to comprehend the dense, graphical language of reactions within authentic literature remains underexplored. Here, we introduce RxnBench, a multi-tiered benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate MLLMs on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs. RxnBench comprises two tasks: Single-Figure QA (SF-QA), which tests fine-grained visual perception and mechanistic reasoning using 1,525 questions derived from 305 curated reaction schemes, and Full-Document QA (FD-QA), which challenges models to synthesize information from 108 articles, requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals a critical capability gap: while models excel at extracting explicit text, they struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Notably, models with inference-time reasoning significantly outperform standard architectures, yet none achieve 50\% accuracy on FD-QA. These findings underscore the urgent need for domain-specific visual encoders and stronger reasoning engines to advance autonomous AI chemists.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-Aware Decoding Mechanisms for Complex Entity Extraction with Large-Scale Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13980v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a structure-aware decoding method based on large language models to address the difficulty of traditional approaches in maintaining both semantic integrity and structural consistency in nested and overlapping entity extraction tasks. The method introduces a candidate span generation mechanism and structured attention modeling to achieve unified modeling of entity boundaries, hierarchical relationships, and cross-dependencies. The model first uses a pretrained language model to obtain context-aware semantic representations, then captures multi-granular entity span features through candidate representation combinations, and introduces hierarchical structural constraints during decoding to ensure consistency between semantics and structure. To enhance stability in complex scenarios, the model jointly optimizes classification loss and structural consistency loss, maintaining high recognition accuracy under multi-entity co-occurrence and long-sentence dependency conditions. Experiments conducted on the ACE 2005 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, particularly in nested and overlapping entity recognition, where the model shows stronger boundary localization and structural modeling capability. This study verifies the effectiveness of structure-aware decoding in complex semantic extraction tasks, provides a new perspective for developing language models with hierarchical understanding, and establishes a methodological foundation for high-precision information extraction.</p></details> |  |

While these models enable impressive reasoning capabilities, they also introduce novel and underexplored privacy risks. In this paper, we identify a novel category of privacy leakage in MLRMs: Adversaries can infer sensitive geolocation information, such as a user's home address or neighborhood, from user-generated images, including selfies captured in private settings. To formalize and evaluate these risks, we propose a three-level visual privacy risk framework that categorizes image content based on contextual sensitivity and potential for location inference. We further introduce DoxBench, a curated dataset of 500 real-world images reflecting diverse privacy scenarios. Our evaluation across 11 advanced MLRMs and MLLMs demonstrates that these models consistently outperform non-expert humans in geolocation inference and can effectively leak location-related private information. This significantly lowers the barrier for adversaries to obtain users' sensitive geolocation information. We further analyze and identify two primary factors contributing to this vulnerability: (1) MLRMs exhibit strong reasoning capabilities by leveraging visual clues in combination with their internal world knowledge; and (2) MLRMs frequently rely on privacy-related visual clues for inference without any built-in mechanisms to suppress or avoid such usage. To better understand and demonstrate real-world attack feasibility, we propose GeoMiner, a collaborative attack framework that decomposes the prediction process into two stages: clue extraction and reasoning to improve geolocation performance while introducing a novel attack perspective. Our findings highlight the urgent need to reassess inference-time privacy risks in MLRMs to better protect users' sensitive information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[The Law of Multi-Model Collaboration: Scaling Limits of Model Ensembling for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23340v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been largely driven by scaling laws for individual models, which predict performance improvements as model parameters and data volume increase. However, the capabilities of any single LLM are inherently bounded. One solution originates from intricate interactions among multiple LLMs, rendering their collective performance surpasses that of any constituent model. Despite the rapid proliferation of multi-model integration techniques such as model routing and post-hoc ensembling, a unifying theoretical framework of performance scaling for multi-model collaboration remains absent. In this work, we propose the Law of Multi-model Collaboration, a scaling law that predicts the performance limits of LLM ensembles based on their aggregated parameter budget. To quantify the intrinsic upper bound of multi-model collaboration, we adopt a method-agnostic formulation and assume an idealized integration oracle where the total cross-entropy loss of each sample is determined by the minimum loss of any model in the model pool. Experimental results reveal that multi-model systems follow a power-law scaling with respect to the total parameter count, exhibiting a more significant improvement trend and a lower theoretical loss floor compared to single model scaling. Moreover, ensembles of heterogeneous model families achieve better performance scaling than those formed within a single model family, indicating that model diversity is a primary driver of collaboration gains. These findings suggest that model collaboration represents a critical axis for extending the intelligence frontier of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose MERGE, a next-generation item indexing paradigm that adaptively constructs clusters from scratch, dynamically monitors cluster occupancy, and forms hierarchical index structures via fine-to-coarse merging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MERGE significantly improves assignment accuracy, cluster uniformity, and cluster separation compared with existing indexing methods, while online A/B tests show substantial gains in key business metrics, highlighting its potential as a foundational indexing approach for large-scale recommendation.</p></details> |  |

| **[MORPH: PDE Foundation Models with Arbitrary Data Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21670v4)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MORPH, a modality-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data modality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, and multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorize full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters, MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from the heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning. The source code, datasets, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/lanl/MORPH.</p></details> |  |
| **[Making Foundation Models Probabilistic via Singular Value Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22068v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have become a dominant paradigm in machine learning, achieving remarkable performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining. However, these models often yield overconfident, uncalibrated predictions. The standard approach to quantifying epistemic uncertainty, training an ensemble of independent models, incurs prohibitive computational costs that scale linearly with ensemble size, making it impractical for large foundation models. We propose Singular Value Ensemble (SVE), a parameter-efficient implicit ensemble method that builds on a simple, but powerful core assumption: namely, that the singular vectors of the weight matrices constitute meaningful subspaces of the model's knowledge. Pretrained foundation models encode rich, transferable information in their weight matrices. If the singular vectors are indeed meaningful (orthogonal) "knowledge directions". To obtain a model ensemble, we modulate only how strongly each direction contributes to the output. Rather than learning entirely new parameters, we freeze the singular vectors and only train per-member singular values that rescale the contribution of each direction in that shared knowledge basis. Ensemble diversity emerges naturally as stochastic initialization and random sampling of mini-batches during joint training cause different members to converge to different combinations of the same underlying knowledge. SVE achieves uncertainty quantification comparable to explicit deep ensembles while increasing the parameter count of the base model by less than 1%, making principled uncertainty estimation accessible in resource-constrained settings. We validate SVE on NLP and vision tasks with various different backbones and show that it improves calibration while maintaining predictive accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, E(3)-equivariant diffusion models often reproduce biases from semi-empirical training data rather than capturing the equilibrium distribution of a high-fidelity Hamiltonian. While physics-based guidance can correct this, it faces two computational bottlenecks: expensive quantum-chemical evaluations (e.g., DFT) and the need to repeat such queries at every sampling step. We present Elign, a post-training framework that amortizes both costs. First, we replace expensive DFT evaluations with a faster, pretrained foundational machine-learning force field (MLFF) to provide physical signals. Second, we eliminate repeated run-time queries by shifting physical steering to the training phase. To achieve the second amortization, we formulate reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce Force--Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO) to fine-tune the denoising policy. FED-GRPO includes a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, which are optimized and group-normalized independently. Experiments show that Elign generates conformations with lower gold-standard DFT energies and forces, while improving stability. Crucially, inference remains as fast as unguided sampling, since no energy evaluations are required during generation.</p></details> |  |

Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive, cost-effective modality for capturing neural activity, though traditional methods often struggle with cross-subject variability and task-specific preprocessing. We propose leveraging Brain Foundation Models (BFMs), large pre-trained neural networks, to extract generalizable EEG features for cognitive load estimation. We adapt BFMs for long-term EEG monitoring and show that fine-tuning a small subset of layers yields improved accuracy over the state-of-the-art. Despite their scale, BFMs allow for real-time inference with a longer context window. To address often-overlooked interpretability challenges, we apply Partition SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify feature importance. Our findings reveal consistent emphasis on prefrontal regions linked to cognitive control, while longitudinal trends suggest learning progression. These results position BFMs as efficient and interpretable tools for continuous cognitive load monitoring in real-world BCIs.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraceRouter: Robust Safety for Large Foundation Models via Path-Level Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21900v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their capabilities, large foundation models (LFMs) remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Current defenses predominantly rely on the "locality hypothesis", suppressing isolated neurons or features. However, harmful semantics act as distributed, cross-layer circuits, rendering such localized interventions brittle and detrimental to utility. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility. Our code will be publicly released. WARNING: This paper contains unsafe model responses.</p></details> |  |

Existing mitigation methods often rely on unavailable group labels or computationally expensive gradient-based adversarial optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Visual Disentangled Diffusion Autoencoders (DiDAE), a novel framework integrating frozen foundation models with disentangled dictionary learning for efficient, gradient-free counterfactual generation directly for the foundation model. DiDAE first edits foundation model embeddings in interpretable disentangled directions of the disentangled dictionary and then decodes them via a diffusion autoencoder. This allows the generation of multiple diverse, disentangled counterfactuals for each factual, much faster than existing baselines, which generate single entangled counterfactuals. When paired with Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation, DiDAE-CFKD achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating shortcut learning, improving downstream performance on unbalanced datasets.</p></details> |  |

With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings. However, to responsibly employ FMs, it is crucial to rigorously assess to which extent the embeddings they produce are generalizable, particularly in error-sensitive domains such as healthcare. Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios. Experimental results show that our benchmarking protocol provides a rich insight of ECG-expert FMs' embedded patterns, enabling a deeper understanding of their representational structure and generalizability.</p></details> |  |

Using a literature review and thematic analysis, we curated exemplar folklore items (e.g., beliefs about where defects occur, the 10x developer legend, and technical debt). We analyzed their narrative form, symbolic meaning, occupational relevance, and links to knowledge areas in software engineering. To ground these concepts in practice, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 industrial practitioners in Sweden to explore how such narratives are recognized or transmitted within their daily work and how they affect it. Synthesizing these results, we propose a working definition of software engineering folklore as informally transmitted, traditional, and emergent narratives and heuristics enacted within occupational folk groups that shape identity, values, and collective knowledge. We argue that making the concept of software engineering folklore explicit provides a foundation for subsequent ethnography and folklore studies and for reflective practice that can preserve context-effective heuristics while challenging unhelpful folklore.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHASE 2026 (19th International Conference on Cooperative and Human Aspects of Software Engineering), co-located with ICSE 2026</p></details> |

However, their clinical applicability is often limited by performance gaps compared to task-specific models, even after pre-training on large ECG datasets and fine-tuning on target data. This limitation is likely due to the lack of an effective post-training strategy. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-training approach to enhance ECG foundation models. We evaluate it on a publicly available Transformer-based foundation model. Experiments across multiple ECG tasks show that our method consistently outperforms baseline fine-tuning. On the PTB-XL benchmarks, it improves macro AUROC by 0.7%-8.9% and macro AUPRC by 23.3%-77.9%, also outperforming several recent state-of-the-art approaches, including task-specific and advanced architectures. Further analyses demonstrate improved training dynamics and data efficiency, with only 30% of the training data outperforming the baseline trained on the full dataset. Ablation studies highlight the importance of stochastic depth and preview linear probing. These findings underscore the potential of post-training strategies to improve ECG foundation models, and we hope this work will contribute to the continued development of foundation models in the ECG domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>A Tra...</summary><p>A Transformer-based model is used as an example; the proposed post-training strategy may also be applicable to CNN-based models.

| **[Rethinking Federated Graph Foundation Models: A Graph-Language Alignment-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21369v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies of federated graph foundational models (FedGFMs) break the idealized and untenable assumption of having centralized data storage to train graph foundation models, and accommodate the reality of distributed, privacy-restricted data silos. Despite their simplicity and intuition, existing studies that project aligned generalizable knowledge onto a discrete token space via vector-quantized backbones suffer from irreversible knowledge loss during the quantization process. In this context, we argue that reconciling the semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity between pre-trained language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) is paramount for developing effective FedGFMs while simultaneously mitigating the severe data heterogeneity and communication constraints inherent in distributed, resource-limited environments. To address these issues, we propose FedGALA (Federated Graph And Language Alignment), a framework that resolves graph-based semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity in federated settings by employing unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNNs and frozen PLMs within a continuous embedding space, thereby capturing robust, transferable general knowledge. Subsequently, FedGALA leverages a communication-efficient prompt tuning mechanism to steer these pre-aligned encoders and frozen PLMs, facilitating effective adaptation to diverse downstream tasks while circumventing the prohibitive overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning. The comprehensive experiments validate that FedGALA outperforms all competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets on multiple tasks with up to 14.37% performance improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review.

A Pseudotime Analysis of Visual Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21334v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models trained on discretely sampled images achieve strong performance on classification benchmarks, yet whether their representations encode the continuous processes underlying their training data remains unclear. This question is especially pertinent in computational pathology, where we posit that models whose latent representations implicitly capture continuous disease progression may better reflect underlying biology, support more robust generalization, and enable quantitative analyses of features associated with disease transitions. Using diffusion pseudotime, a method developed to infer developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics, we probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space. Across four cancer progressions and six models, we find that all pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities $(τ> 0.78$ on CRC-Serrated). Model rankings by trajectory fidelity on reference diseases strongly predict few-shot classification performance on held-out diseases ($ρ= 0.92$), and exploratory analysis shows cell-type composition varies smoothly along inferred trajectories in patterns consistent with known stromal remodeling. Together, these results demonstrate that vision foundation models can implicitly learn to represent continuous processes from independent static observations, and that trajectory fidelity provides a complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance. While demonstrated in pathology, this framework could be applied to other domains where continuous processes are observed through static snapshots.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 17 figures.

Prior works have attempted to mitigate this by incorporating a memory architecture that stores prototypes of normal patterns. Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from high training costs and have yet to be effectively integrated with time series foundation models (TFMs). To address these challenges, we propose MOMEMTO, an improved variant of TFM for anomaly detection, enhanced with a patch-based memory module to mitigate over-generalization. The memory module is designed to capture representative normal patterns from multiple domains and enables a single model to be jointly fine-tuned across multiple datasets through a multi-domain training strategy. MOMEMTO initializes memory items with latent representations from a pre-trained encoder, organizes them into patch-level units, and updates them via an attention mechanism. We evaluate our method using 23 univariate benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MOMEMTO, as a single model, achieves higher scores on AUC and VUS metrics compared to baseline methods, and further enhances the performance of its backbone TFM, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Existing EA models lack transferability and are incapable of aligning unseen KGs without retraining. While using graph foundation models (GFMs) offer a solution, we find that directly adapting GFMs to EA remains largely ineffective. This stems from a critical "reasoning horizon gap": unlike link prediction in GFMs, EA necessitates capturing long-range dependencies across sparse and heterogeneous KG structuresTo address this challenge, we propose a EA foundation model driven by a parallel encoding strategy. We utilize seed EA pairs as local anchors to guide the information flow, initializing and encoding two parallel streams simultaneously. This facilitates anchor-conditioned message passing and significantly shortens the inference trajectory by leveraging local structural proximity instead of global search. Additionally, we incorporate a merged relation graph to model global dependencies and a learnable interaction module for precise matching. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its strong generalizability to unseen KGs.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 11 types of FAEs to investigate how these factors affect MSA performance.

While normalization is well-studied in dataset-specific time-series models, it remains overlooked in TSFMs where generalization is critical. Time-series data, unlike text or images, exhibits significant scale variation across domains and channels, coupled with non-stationarity, can undermine TSFM performance regardless of architectural complexity. Through systematic evaluation across four architecturally diverse TSFMs, we empirically establish REVIN as the most efficient approach, reducing zero-shot MASE by 89\% relative to an un-normalized baseline and by 44\% versus other normalization methods, while matching the best in-domain accuracy (0.84 MASE) without any dataset-level preprocessing -- yielding the highest accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Yet its effect utilization depends on architectural design choices and optimization objective, particularly with respect to training loss scale sensitivity and model type (probabilistic, point-forecast, or LLM-based models).</p></details> |  |
| **[Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21067v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are a fundamental data structure for representing relational information in domains such as social networks, molecular systems, and knowledge graphs. However, graph learning models often suffer from limited generalization when applied beyond their training distributions. In practice, distribution shifts may arise from changes in graph structure, domain semantics, available modalities, or task formulations. To address these challenges, graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged, aiming to learn general-purpose representations through large-scale pretraining across diverse graphs and tasks. In this survey, we review recent progress on GFMs from the perspective of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We first discuss the main challenges posed by distribution shifts in graph learning and outline a unified problem setting. We then organize existing approaches based on whether they are designed to operate under a fixed task specification or to support generalization across heterogeneous task formulations, and summarize the corresponding OOD handling strategies and pretraining objectives. Finally, we review common evaluation protocols and discuss open directions for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first survey for OOD generalization in GFMs.</p></details> |  |

We show that fMLIPs trained on large datasets such as MPtrj, Alexandria, and OMat24 encode inconsistencies from the Materials Project's selective use of the Hubbard U correction, which is applied to certain transition metals only if O or F atoms are present in the simulation cell. This inconsistent use of +U creates two incompatible potential-energy surfaces (PES): a lower-energy GGA surface and a higher-energy GGA+U one. When trained on both, MLIPs interpolate between them, leading to systematic underbinding, or even spurious repulsion, between U-corrected metals and oxygen- or fluorine-containing species. Models such as MACE-OMAT and -MPA exhibit repulsion between U-corrected metals and their oxides, limiting their value for studying catalysis and oxidation. We link the severity of this pathology to the oxygen number density in U-corrected training configurations. This explains why OMAT-trained models are most affected and suggests the issue might worsen as expanding future datasets increasingly include configurations with low oxygen content, such as those generated through combinatorial exploration of multi-element or defect-containing systems. Our simple per-U-corrected-atom shift aligns PBE+U and PBE energies for identical structures, yielding a smoother PES compared to existing correction schemes, which target phase diagram accuracy. As a result, models trained on datasets with our shift applied exhibit smaller mean absolute errors for the adsorption energies of oxygen on U-corrected elemental slabs. Since datasets omitting +U entirely (e.g. MatPES, MP-ALOE) avoid these pathologies, we recommend excluding +U in future fMLIP datasets. For existing datasets, our post-hoc correction provides a low-cost improvement.</p></details> |  |

Standard masked modeling often yields trivial solutions while contrastive methods lack morphological precision. To address these limitations, we propose a Statistical-prior Informed Generative Masking Architecture (SIGMA-PPG), a generative foundation model featuring a Prior-Guided Adversarial Masking mechanism, where a reinforcement learning-driven teacher leverages statistical priors to create challenging learning paths that prevent overfitting to noise. We also incorporate a semantic consistency constraint via vector quantization to ensure that physiologically identical waveforms (even those altered by recording artifacts or minor perturbations) map to shared indices. This enhances codebook semantic density and eliminates redundant feature structures. Pre-trained on over 120,000 hours of data, SIGMA-PPG achieves superior average performance compared to five state-of-the-art baselines across 12 diverse downstream tasks.

Many existing approaches require domain-specific feature engineering and substantial labeled data for each task. We introduce PatchFormer, a patch-based time series foundation model that uses hierarchical masked reconstruction for self-supervised pretraining and lightweight adapters for efficient transfer. PatchFormer segments time series into patches and learns multiscale temporal representations with learnable aggregation across temporal scales. Pretraining uses masked patch reconstruction with dynamic masking and objectives that encourage both local accuracy and global consistency, followed by cross-domain knowledge distillation. Experiments on 24 benchmark datasets spanning weather, energy, traffic, finance, and healthcare demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot multi-horizon forecasting, reducing mean squared error by 27.3 percent relative to strong baselines while requiring 94 percent less task-specific training data. The model exhibits near log-linear scaling with more pretraining data up to 100 billion points and processes length-512 sequences 3.8x faster than full-sequence transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages; 2 figures; 7 tables</p></details> |

We introduce TwinWeaver, an open-source framework that serializes longitudinal patient histories into text, enabling unified event prediction as well as forecasting with large language models, and use it to build Genie Digital Twin (GDT) on 93,054 patients across 20 cancer types. In benchmarks, GDT significantly reduces forecasting error, achieving a median Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) of 0.87 compared to 0.97 for the strongest time-series baseline (p<0.001). Furthermore, GDT improves risk stratification, achieving an average concordance index (C-index) of 0.703 across survival, progression, and therapy switching tasks, surpassing the best baseline of 0.662. GDT also generalizes to out-of-distribution clinical trials, matching trained baselines at zero-shot and surpassing them with fine-tuning, achieving a median MASE of 0.75-0.88 and outperforming the strongest baseline in event prediction with an average C-index of 0.672 versus 0.648. Finally, TwinWeaver enables an interpretable clinical reasoning extension, providing a scalable and transparent foundation for longitudinal clinical modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundation Model for Virtual Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20634v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual sensors use machine learning to predict target signals from available measurements, replacing expensive physical sensors in critical applications. Existing virtual sensor approaches require application-specific models with hand-selected inputs for each sensor, cannot leverage task synergies, and lack consistent benchmarks. At the same time, emerging time series foundation models are computationally expensive and limited to predicting their input signals, making them incompatible with virtual sensors. We introduce the first foundation model for virtual sensors addressing both limitations. Our unified model can simultaneously predict diverse virtual sensors exploiting synergies while maintaining computational efficiency. It learns relevant input signals for each virtual sensor, eliminating expert knowledge requirements while adding explainability. In our large-scale evaluation on a standard benchmark and an application-specific dataset with over 18 billion samples, our architecture achieves 415x reduction in computation time and 951x reduction in memory requirements, while maintaining or even improving predictive quality compared to baselines. Our model scales gracefully to hundreds of virtual sensors with nearly constant parameter count, enabling practical deployment in large-scale sensor networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages in total, 15 figures</p></details> |

While recent approaches leverage vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to transfer high-level concept knowledge, methods based on purely vision foundation models (VFMs), like DINOv2, have lagged behind in performance. We argue that this gap stems from two practical issues: (i) limited diversity in existing auxiliary anomaly detection datasets and (ii) overly shallow VFM adaptation strategies. To address both challenges, we propose AnomalyVFM, a general and effective framework that turns any pretrained VFM into a strong zero-shot anomaly detector. Our approach combines a robust three-stage synthetic dataset generation scheme with a parameter-efficient adaptation mechanism, utilising low-rank feature adapters and a confidence-weighted pixel loss. Together, these components enable modern VFMs to substantially outperform current state-of-the-art methods. More specifically, with RADIO as a backbone, AnomalyVFM achieves an average image-level AUROC of 94.1% across 9 diverse datasets, surpassing previous methods by significant 3.3 percentage points.

| **[Physics-Guided Multimodal Transformers are the Necessary Foundation for the Next Generation of Meteorological Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14174v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This position paper argues that the next generation of artificial intelligence in meteorological and climate sciences must transition from fragmented hybrid heuristics toward a unified paradigm of physics-guided multimodal transformers. While purely data-driven models have achieved significant gains in predictive accuracy, they often treat atmospheric processes as mere visual patterns, frequently producing results that lack scientific consistency or violate fundamental physical laws. We contend that current ``hybrid'' attempts to bridge this gap remain ad-hoc and struggle to scale across the heterogeneous nature of meteorological data ranging from satellite imagery to sparse sensor measurements. We argue that the transformer architecture, through its inherent capacity for cross-modal alignment, provides the only viable foundation for a systematic integration of domain knowledge via physical constraint embedding and physics-informed loss functions. By advocating for this unified architectural shift, we aim to steer the community away from ``black-box'' curve fitting and toward AI systems that are inherently falsifiable, scientifically grounded, and robust enough to address the existential challenges of extreme weather and climate change.</p></details> | Perspective article |
| **[Visual Instruction Pretraining for Domain-Specific Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17562v3)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern computer vision is converging on a closed loop in which perception, reasoning and generation mutually reinforce each other. However, this loop remains incomplete: the top-down influence of high-level reasoning on the foundational learning of low-level perceptual features is not yet underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a new paradigm for pretraining foundation models in downstream domains. We introduce Visual insTruction Pretraining (ViTP), a novel approach that directly leverages reasoning to enhance perception. ViTP embeds a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone within a Vision-Language Model and pretrains it end-to-end using a rich corpus of visual instruction data curated from target downstream domains. ViTP is powered by our proposed Visual Robustness Learning (VRL), which compels the ViT to learn robust and domain-relevant features from a sparse set of visual tokens. Extensive experiments on 16 challenging remote sensing and medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that ViTP establishes new state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of downstream tasks.

By combining foundation models with the principles of embodied AI, where intelligent systems perceive, reason, and act through physical interaction, mobile service robots can achieve more flexible understanding, adaptive behavior, and robust task execution in dynamic real-world environments. Despite this progress, embodied AI for mobile service robots continues to face fundamental challenges related to the translation of natural language instructions into executable robot actions, multimodal perception in human-centered environments, uncertainty estimation for safe decision-making, and computational constraints for real-time onboard deployment. In this paper, we present the first systematic review focused specifically on the integration of foundation models in mobile service robotics. We analyze how recent advances in foundation models address these core challenges through language-conditioned control, multimodal sensor fusion, uncertainty-aware reasoning, and efficient model scaling. We further examine real-world applications in domestic assistance, healthcare, and service automation, highlighting how foundation models enable context-aware, socially responsive, and generalizable robot behaviors. Beyond technical considerations, we discuss ethical, societal, and human-interaction implications associated with deploying foundation model-enabled service robots in human environments. Finally, we outline future research directions emphasizing reliability and lifelong adaptation, privacy-aware and resource-constrained deployment, and governance and human-in-the-loop frameworks required for safe, scalable, and trustworthy mobile service robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: E...</summary><p>v2: Expanded systematic review; resubmitted to Robotics</p></details> |

This mixed-methods study (N = 201) examined how anthropomorphic levels and moral foundations shape reactions to robot abuse. Participants viewed videos depicting physical mistreatment of robots varying in humanness (Spider, Twofoot, Humanoid) and completed measures assessing moral foundations, anger, and social distance. Results revealed that anthropomorphism determines whether people extend moral consideration to robots, while moral foundations shape how they reason about such consideration. Qualitative analysis revealed distinct reasoning patterns: low-progressivism individuals employed character-based judgments, while high-progressivism individuals engaged in future-oriented moral deliberation. Findings offer implications for robot design and policy communication.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are trained directly on complex downstream tasks, often bypassing these foundational visual capabilities. To systematically investigate this gap, we introduce VisFactor, a benchmark that digitizes 20 vision-centric subtests from FRCT, a well-established cognitive psychology assessment spanning four domains of human visual cognition. Furthermore, we design algorithms to automatically construct and validate unlimited test cases with controllable difficulty. Using VisFactor, we evaluate 23 frontier MLLMs, including both proprietary (e.g., GPT, Gemini) and open-source (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen) models. The best model achieves a score of only 30.17%. Models consistently fail on tasks such as mental rotation, spatial relation inference, and figure-ground discrimination, regardless of model size or prompting strategy. These findings suggest that performance improvements on existing general benchmarks might represent castles in the air instead of a genuine mastery of human-like visual cognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update: Evaluated 23 SOTA MLLMs</p></details> |

Meanwhile, monolithic execution at the edge remains infeasible under stringent resource limits and uncertain network dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a microservice-based FM inference framework that exploits the intrinsic functional asymmetry between heavyweight core services and agile light services. Our two-tier deployment strategy ensures robust Quality of Service (QoS) under resource contention. Specifically, core services are placed statically via a long-term network-aware integer program with sparsity constraints to form a fault-tolerant backbone. On the other hand, light services are orchestrated dynamically by a low-complexity online controller that integrates effective capacity theory with Lyapunov optimization, providing probabilistic latency guarantees under real-time workload fluctuations. Simulations demonstrate that our framework achieves over 84% average on-time task completion with moderate deployment costs and maintains strong robustness as the system load scales.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 fig...</summary><p>4 figures.

Many such foundation models adopt approaches that have demonstrated success in computer vision with minimal domain-specific modification. However, the development and application of foundation models in this field are still burgeoning, as there are a variety of competing approaches for how to most effectively leverage remotely sensed data. This paper examines these approaches, along with their roots in the computer vision field. This is done to characterize potential advantages and pitfalls, while outlining future directions to further improve remote sensing-specific foundation models. We discuss the quality of the learned representations and methods to alleviate the need for massive compute resources. We first examine single-sensor remote foundation models to introduce concepts and provide context, and then place emphasis on incorporating the multi-sensor aspect of Earth observations into foundation models. In particular, we explore the extent to which existing approaches leverage multiple sensors in training foundation models in relation to multi-modal foundation models. Finally, we identify opportunities for further harnessing the vast amounts of unlabeled, seasonal, and multi-sensor remote sensing observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, submitted to ACM SigSpatial, accepted as of January 12th, 2026.

Existing augmentation methods, however, typically rely on heuristics and static paradigms. Motivated by dynamic data optimization, which shows that the contribution of samples varies across training stages, we propose OATS (Online Data Augmentation for Time Series Foundation Models), a principled strategy that generates synthetic data tailored to different training steps. OATS leverages valuable training samples as principled guiding signals and dynamically generates high-quality synthetic data conditioned on them. We further design a diffusion-based framework to produce realistic time series and introduce an explore-exploit mechanism to balance efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on TSFMs demonstrate that OATS consistently outperforms regular training and yields substantial performance gains over static data augmentation baselines across six validation datasets and two TSFM architectures.

I propose using pre-trained audio foundation models, specifically MuQ and MERT, to predict 19 perceptual dimensions of piano performance quality. Using synthesized audio from PercePiano MIDI files (rendered via Pianoteq), I compare audio and symbolic approaches under controlled conditions where both derive from identical source data. The best model, MuQ layers 9-12 with Pianoteq soundfont augmentation, achieves R^2 = 0.537 (95% CI: [0.465, 0.575]), representing a 55% improvement over the symbolic baseline (R^2 = 0.347). Statistical analysis confirms significance (p < 10^-25) with audio outperforming symbolic on all 19 dimensions. I validate the approach through cross-soundfont generalization (R^2 = 0.534 +/- 0.075), difficulty correlation with an external dataset (rho = 0.623), and multi-performer consistency analysis. Analysis of audio-symbolic fusion reveals high error correlation (r = 0.738), explaining why fusion provides minimal benefit: audio representations alone are sufficient. I release the complete training pipeline, pretrained models, and inference code.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

Recent advances in foundation models have transformed visual and language understanding, yet their integration with radar sensing remains largely underexplored. Existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific; each downstream task employs distinct architectures and training objectives, preventing transfer across tasks. In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision. We make two key contributions: (1) a structured caption framework that encodes vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates, and (2) a hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity rather than binary matching, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning. Leveraging the CARLA simulator, we generate large-scale, well-annotated radar datasets across diverse driving scenarios. We also propose localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches predominantly rely on unimodal RGB pre-training, overlooking the complex 3D geometry inherent to surgical environments. Although several architectures support multimodal or geometry-aware inputs in general computer vision, the benefits of incorporating depth information in surgical settings remain underexplored. We conduct a large-scale empirical study comparing eight ViT-based VFMs that differ in pre-training domain, learning objective, and input modality (RGB vs. RGB-D). For pre-training, we use a curated dataset of 1.4 million robotic surgical images paired with depth maps generated from an off-the-shelf network. We evaluate these models under both frozen-backbone and end-to-end fine-tuning protocols across eight surgical datasets spanning object detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and pose estimation. Our experiments yield several consistent findings. Models incorporating explicit geometric tokenization, such as MultiMAE, substantially outperform unimodal baselines across all tasks. Notably, geometric-aware pre-training enables remarkable data efficiency: models fine-tuned on just 25% of labeled data consistently surpass RGB-only models trained on the full dataset. Importantly, these gains require no architectural or runtime changes at inference; depth is used only during pre-training, making adoption straightforward. These findings suggest that multimodal pre-training offers a viable path towards building more capable surgical vision systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, representation learning for depth modality remains underexplored compared to RGB, where large-scale foundation models now define the state of the art. To address this gap, we present DeFM, a self-supervised foundation model trained entirely on depth images for robotic applications. Using a DINO-style self-distillation objective on a curated dataset of 60M depth images, DeFM learns geometric and semantic representations that generalize to diverse environments, tasks, and sensors. To retain metric awareness across multiple scales, we introduce a novel input normalization strategy. We further distill DeFM into compact models suitable for resource-constrained robotic systems. When evaluated on depth-based classification, segmentation, navigation, locomotion, and manipulation benchmarks, DeFM achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong generalization from simulation to real-world environments.

However, FMs typically require weeks of training on large databases, making their creation a resource-intensive process. In this paper, we present a training for foundation models from whole slide images using supervised, end-to-end, multitask learning on slide-level labels. Notably, it is the first model to incorporate cancer subtyping, risk estimation, and genetic mutation prediction into one model. The presented model outperforms self-supervised models on seven benchmark tasks while the training only required 5% of the computational resources. The results not only show that supervised training can outperform self-supervision with less data, but also offer a solution to annotation problems, as patient-based labels are widely available through routine clinical processes. Furthermore, an attention module provides a layer of explainability across different tasks and serves as a tumor detector for unseen cancer types. To address the issue of closed-source datasets, the model was fully trained on openly available data. The code and model weights are made available under https://github.com/FraunhoferMEVIS/MedicalMultitaskModeling.</p></details> |  |

Access to a Physics Foundation Model (PFM) would be transformative - democratizing access to high-fidelity simulations, accelerating scientific discovery, and eliminating the need for specialized solver development. Yet current physics-aware machine learning approaches remain fundamentally limited to single, narrow domains and require retraining for each new system. We present the General Physics Transformer (GPhyT), trained on 1.8 TB of diverse simulation data, that demonstrates foundation model capabilities are achievable for physics. Our key insight is that transformers can learn to infer governing dynamics from context, enabling a single model to simulate fluid-solid interactions, shock waves, thermal convection, and multi-phase dynamics without being told the underlying equations. GPhyT achieves three critical breakthroughs: (1) superior performance across multiple physics domains, outperforming specialized architectures by more than 7x, (2) plausible zero-shot generalization to entirely unseen physical systems through in-context learning, and (3) more stable long-term predictions through long-horizon rollouts.

Our framework consists of four major components: (1) HeartCLAP, an audio-text alignment model; (2) HeartTranscriptor, a robust lyric recognition model optimized for real-world music scenarios; and (3) HeartCodec, a low-frame-rate (12.5 Hz) yet high-fidelity music codec tokenizer that captures long-range musical structure while preserving fine-grained acoustic details and enabling efficient autoregressive modeling; (4) HeartMuLa, an LLM-based song generation model capable of synthesizing high-fidelity music under rich, user-controllable conditions (e.g., textual style descriptions, lyrics, and reference audio). In addition, it provides two specialized modes: (i) fine-grained musical attribute control, which allows users to specify the style of different song sections (e.g., intro, verse, chorus) using natural language prompts; and (ii) short, engaging music generation, which is suitable as background music for short videos. Lastly, HeartMuLa improves significantly when scaled to 7B parameters. For the first time, we show that a Suno-level, commercial-grade system can be reproduced using academic-scale data and GPU resources. We expect these foundation models to serve as strong baselines for future research and to facilitate practical applications in multimodal content production.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Models in Autonomous Driving: A Survey on Scenario Generation and Scenario Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11526v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For autonomous vehicles, safe navigation in complex environments depends on handling a broad range of diverse and rare driving scenarios. Simulation- and scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies, open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and research questions, and outlining promising future research directions. All reviewed papers are listed in a continuously maintained repository, which contains supplementary materials and is available at https://github.com/TUM-AVS/FM-for-Scenario-Generation-Analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final version (Accepted by the IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems)</p></details> |

Unlike prior studies that extrinsically analyze transcriptions produced by Whisper, our approach goes a step further to probe its latent capabilities by extracting acoustic and linguistic features from hidden representations. With only a lightweight classifier being trained on top of Whisper's intermediate and final outputs, our method achieves strong performance on the GEPT picture-description dataset, outperforming existing cutting-edge baselines, including a multimodal approach. Furthermore, by incorporating image and text-prompt information as auxiliary relevance cues, we demonstrate additional performance gains. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of Whisper's embeddings, which reveals that, even without task-specific fine-tuning, the model intrinsically encodes both ordinal proficiency patterns and semantic aspects of speech, highlighting its potential as a powerful foundation for SLA and other spoken language understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[A multimodal vision foundation model for generalizable knee pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18250v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Musculoskeletal disorders represent a leading cause of global disability, creating an urgent demand for precise interpretation of medical imaging. Current artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in orthopedics predominantly rely on task-specific, supervised learning paradigms. These methods are inherently fragmented, require extensive annotated datasets, and often lack generalizability across different modalities and clinical scenarios. The development of foundation models in this field has been constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, curated, and open-source musculoskeletal datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce OrthoFoundation, a multimodal vision foundation model optimized for musculoskeletal pathology. We constructed a pre-training dataset of 1.2 million unlabeled knee X-ray and MRI images from internal and public databases. Utilizing a Dinov3 backbone, the model was trained via self-supervised contrastive learning to capture robust radiological representations. OrthoFoundation achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across 14 downstream tasks. It attained superior accuracy in X-ray osteoarthritis diagnosis and ranked first in MRI structural injury detection. The model demonstrated remarkable label efficiency, matching supervised baselines using only 50% of labeled data. Furthermore, despite being pre-trained on knee images, OrthoFoundation exhibited exceptional cross-anatomy generalization to the hip, shoulder, and ankle. OrthoFoundation represents a significant advancement toward general-purpose AI for musculoskeletal imaging. By learning fundamental, joint-agnostic radiological semantics from large-scale multimodal data, it overcomes the limitations of conventional models, which provides a robust framework for reducing annotation burdens and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in learning-based control have shown great potential in enabling robots to acquire and generalize complex manipulation skills in such environments, but ensuring safety, both during exploration and execution, remains a critical bottleneck for reliable real-world deployment. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of safe learning-based methods for robot contact-rich tasks. We categorize existing approaches into two main domains: safe exploration and safe execution. We review key techniques, including constrained reinforcement learning, risk-sensitive optimization, uncertainty-aware modeling, control barrier functions, and model predictive safety shields, and highlight how these methods incorporate prior knowledge, task structure, and online adaptation to balance safety and efficiency. A particular emphasis of this survey is on how these safe learning principles extend to and interact with emerging robotic foundation models, especially vision-language models (VLMs) and vision-language-action models (VLAs), which unify perception, language, and control for contact-rich manipulation. We discuss both the new safety opportunities enabled by VLM/VLA-based methods, such as language-level specification of constraints and multimodal grounding of safety signals, and the amplified risks and evaluation challenges they introduce. Finally, we outline current limitations and promising future directions toward deploying reliable, safety-aligned, and foundation-model-enabled robots in complex contact-rich environments.

| **[HeterCSI: Channel-Adaptive Heterogeneous CSI Pretraining Framework for Generalized Wireless Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18200v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wireless foundation models promise transformative capabilities for channel state information (CSI) processing across diverse 6G network applications, yet face fundamental challenges due to the inherent dual heterogeneity of CSI across both scale and scenario dimensions. However, current pretraining approaches either constrain inputs to fixed dimensions or isolate training by scale, limiting the generalization and scalability of wireless foundation models. In this paper, we propose HeterCSI, a channel-adaptive pretraining framework that reconciles training efficiency with robust cross-scenario generalization via a new understanding of gradient dynamics in heterogeneous CSI pretraining. Our key insight reveals that CSI scale heterogeneity primarily causes destructive gradient interference, while scenario diversity actually promotes constructive gradient alignment when properly managed. Specifically, we formulate heterogeneous CSI batch construction as a partitioning optimization problem that minimizes zero-padding overhead while preserving scenario diversity. To solve this, we develop a scale-aware adaptive batching strategy that aligns CSI samples of similar scales, and design a double-masking mechanism to isolate valid signals from padding artifacts. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that HeterCSI establishes a generalized foundation model without scenario-specific finetuning, achieving superior average performance over full-shot baselines. Compared to the state-of-the-art zero-shot benchmark WiFo, it reduces NMSE by 7.19 dB, 4.08 dB, and 5.27 dB for CSI reconstruction, time-domain, and frequency-domain prediction, respectively. The proposed HeterCSI framework also reduces training latency by 53% compared to existing approaches while improving generalization performance by 1.53 dB on average.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[EEG Foundation Models: Progresses, Benchmarking, and Open Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17883v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), aiming to learn transferable neural representations from large-scale heterogeneous recordings. Despite rapid progresses, there lacks fair and comprehensive comparisons of existing EEG foundation models, due to inconsistent pre-training objectives, preprocessing choices, and downstream evaluation protocols. This paper fills this gap. We first review 50 representative models and organize their design choices into a unified taxonomic framework including data standardization, model architectures, and self-supervised pre-training strategies. We then evaluate 12 open-source foundation models and competitive specialist baselines across 13 EEG datasets spanning nine BCI paradigms. Emphasizing real-world deployments, we consider both cross-subject generalization under a leave-one-subject-out protocol and rapid calibration under a within-subject few-shot setting. We further compare full-parameter fine-tuning with linear probing to assess the transferability of pre-trained representations, and examine the relationship between model scale and downstream performance. Our results indicate that: 1) linear probing is frequently insufficient; 2) specialist models trained from scratch remain competitive across many tasks; and, 3) larger foundation models do not necessarily yield better generalization performance under current data regimes and training practices.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce FMIR, a foundation model-based registration framework that overcomes this limitation.Combining a foundation model-based feature encoder for extracting anatomical structures with a general registration head, and trained with a channel regularization strategy on just a single dataset, FMIR achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) in-domain performance while maintaining robust registration on out-of-domain images.Our approach demonstrates a viable path toward building generalizable medical imaging foundation models with limited resources.

Numerous prior studies have developed bespoke deep learning models over TCGA for tasks such as cancer survival prediction. A modern paradigm in biomedical deep learning is the development of foundation models (FMs) to derive feature embeddings agnostic to a specific modeling task. Biomedical text especially has seen growing development of FMs. While TCGA contains free-text data as pathology reports, these have been historically underutilized. Here, we investigate the ability to train classical machine learning models over multimodal, zero-shot FM embeddings of cancer data. We demonstrate the ease and additive effect of multimodal fusion, outperforming unimodal models. Further, we show the benefit of including pathology report text and rigorously evaluate the effect of model-based text summarization and hallucination. Overall, we propose an embedding-centric approach to multimodal cancer modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>camer...</summary><p>camera ready version for ML4H 2025, typo corrected</p></details> |

However, GFMs remain constrained by in-memory bottlenecks: they attempt to encode knowledge into model parameters, which limits semantic capacity, introduces heavy lossy compression with conflicts, and entangles graph representation with the knowledge in ways that hinder efficient adaptation, undermining scalability and interpretability. In this work,we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters and complements parameterized learning. To externalize graph knowledge, we build a dual-modal unified retrieval module, where a semantic store from prefix-structured text and a structural store from centrality-based motif. To preserve heterogeneous information, we design a dual-view alignment objective that contrasts both modalities to capture both content and relational patterns. To enable efficient downstream adaptation, we perform in-context augmentation to enrich supporting instances with retrieved texts and motifs as contextual evidence. Extensive experiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate that RAG-GFM consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines in both cross-domain node and graph classification, achieving superior effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Web Conference 2026 (Research Track)</p></details> |

In this paper, we explore methods that train reward models using both unlabeled and labeled data. Building on the generative models in LLMs, we develop a generative reward model that is first trained via large-scale unsupervised learning and then fine-tuned via supervised learning. We also show that by using label smoothing, we are in fact optimizing a regularized pairwise ranking loss. This result, in turn, provides a new view of training reward models, which links generative models and discriminative models under the same class of training objectives. The outcome of these techniques is a foundation reward model, which can be applied to a wide range of tasks with little or no further fine-tuning effort. Extensive experiments show that this model generalizes well across several tasks, including response ranking, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and task adaptation with fine-tuning, achieving significant performance improvements over several strong baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Diversified Scaling Inference in Time Series Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17376v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has been driven primarily by large-scale pre-training, but inference-time compute potential remains largely untapped. This work systematically investigates two questions: how do TSFMs behave under standard sampling-based inference scaling, and can controlled sampling diversity enhance performance? We first examine the properties of TSFMs under standard sampling often fail to adhere to scaling laws due to insufficient exploration of the solution space. Building on this, we then delve into diversified inference scaling via tailored time series perturbations to expand the generative distribution's support. We theoretically analyze the diversity-fidelity trade-off and derive a critical sample threshold for diversified sampling to outperform standard sampling. Extensive experiments across various TSFMs and datasets show proper diversified inference scaling yields substantial performance gains without parameter updates, establishing inference design as a critical, compute-efficient dimension of TSFM optimization. As an application, we propose RobustMSE, a rigorous metric to quantify the headroom performance of TSFM under a fixed budget. Overall, our findings clarify these factor interactions, enabling reliable performance via diverse large-scale inference time series in parallel environments without re-training TSFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 16 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Tabular Foundation Models are Strong Graph Anomaly Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17301v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to identify abnormal nodes that deviate from the majority, has become increasingly important in high-stakes Web domains. However, existing GAD methods follow a "one model per dataset" paradigm, leading to high computational costs, substantial data demands, and poor generalization when transferred to new datasets. This calls for a foundation model that enables a "one-for-all" GAD solution capable of detecting anomalies across diverse graphs without retraining. Yet, achieving this is challenging due to the large structural and feature heterogeneity across domains. In this paper, we propose TFM4GAD, a simple yet effective framework that adapts tabular foundation models (TFMs) for graph anomaly detection. Our key insight is that the core challenges of foundation GAD, handling heterogeneous features, generalizing across domains, and operating with scarce labels, are the exact problems that modern TFMs are designed to solve via synthetic pre-training and powerful in-context learning. The primary challenge thus becomes structural: TFMs are agnostic to graph topology. TFM4GAD bridges this gap by "flattening" the graph, constructing an augmented feature table that enriches raw node features with Laplacian embeddings, local and global structural characteristics, and anomaly-sensitive neighborhood aggregations. This augmented table is processed by a TFM in a fully in-context regime. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets with various TFM backbones reveal that TFM4GAD surprisingly achieves significant performance gains over specialized GAD models trained from scratch. Our work offers a new perspective and a practical paradigm for leveraging TFMs as powerful, generalist graph anomaly detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2026 (Short Paper)</p></details> |

We address these challenges in the context of collider physics by introducing EveNet, an event-level foundation model pretrained on 500 million simulated collision events using a hybrid objective of self-supervised learning and physics-informed supervision. By leveraging a shared particle-cloud representation, EveNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse tasks, including searches for heavy resonances and exotic Higgs decays, and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in low-statistics regimes. Crucially, we validate the transferability of the model to experimental data by rediscovering the $Υ$ meson in CMS Open Data and show its capacity for precision physics through the robust extraction of quantum correlation observables stable against systematic uncertainties. These results indicate that EveNet can successfully encode the fundamental physical structure of particle interactions, which offers a unified and resource-efficient framework to accelerate discovery at current and future colliders.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Towards Reasoning for PDE Foundation Models: A Reward-Model-Driven Inference-Time-Scaling Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02846v3)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking" strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational workflows in physics and engineering.</p></details> |  |

Image registration, a foundational task in neuroimaging, has similarly advanced through the Learn2Reg initiative. Building on this, we introduce the Large-scale Unsupervised Brain MRI Image Registration (LUMIR) challenge, a next-generation benchmark for unsupervised brain MRI registration. Previous challenges relied upon anatomical label maps, however LUMIR provides 4,014 unlabeled T1-weighted MRIs for training, encouraging biologically plausible deformation modeling through self-supervision. Evaluation includes 590 in-domain test subjects and extensive zero-shot tasks across disease populations, imaging protocols, and species. Deep learning methods consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance and produced anatomically plausible, diffeomorphic deformation fields. They outperformed several leading optimization-based methods and remained robust to most domain shifts. These findings highlight the growing maturity of deep learning in neuroimaging registration and its potential to serve as a foundation model for general-purpose medical image registration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical Foundations of Scaling Law in Familial Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23407v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural scaling laws have become foundational for optimizing large language model (LLM) training, yet they typically assume a single dense model output. This limitation effectively overlooks "Familial models, a transformative paradigm essential for realizing ubiquitous intelligence across heterogeneous device-edge-cloud hierarchies. Transcending static architectures, familial models integrate early exits with relay-style inference to spawn G deployable sub-models from a single shared backbone. In this work, we theoretically and empirically extend the scaling law to capture this "one-run, many-models" paradigm by introducing Granularity (G) as a fundamental scaling variable alongside model size (N) and training tokens (D). To rigorously quantify this relationship, we propose a unified functional form L(N, D, G) and parameterize it using large-scale empirical runs. Specifically, we employ a rigorous IsoFLOP experimental design to strictly isolate architectural impact from computational scale. Across fixed budgets, we systematically sweep model sizes (N) and granularities (G) while dynamically adjusting tokens (D). This approach effectively decouples the marginal cost of granularity from the benefits of scale, ensuring high-fidelity parameterization of our unified scaling law. Our results reveal that the granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent. Theoretically, this bridges fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures. Practically, it validates the "train once, deploy many" paradigm, demonstrating that deployment flexibility is achievable without compromising the compute-optimality of dense baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variability-Aware Detection and Repair of Compilation Errors Using Foundation Models in Configurable Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16755v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software systems often rely on conditional compilation to support optional features and multiple deployment scenarios. In configurable systems, compilation errors may arise only under specific combinations of features, remaining hidden during development and testing. Such variability-induced errors are difficult to detect in practice, as traditional compilers analyze only a single configuration at a time, while existing variability-aware tools typically require complex setup and incur high analysis costs. In this article, we present an empirical study on the use of foundation models to detect and fix compilation errors caused by feature variability in configurable C systems. We evaluate GPT-OSS-20B and GEMINI 3 PRO, and compare them with TYPECHEF, a state-of-the-art variability-aware parser. Our evaluation considers two complementary settings: 5,000 small configurable systems designed to systematically exercise variability-induced compilation behavior, comprising both systems with and without compilation errors, and 14 real-world GitHub commits, as well as an additional set of mutation testing scenarios (42). Our results show that foundation models can effectively identify variability-induced compilation errors. On small configurable systems, GPT-OSS-20B achieved a precision of 0.97, recall of 0.90, and accuracy of 0.94, substantially increasing detection coverage compared to TYPECHEF, and exhibiting performance comparable to GEMINI 3. For compilation error repair, GPT-OSS-20B produced compilable fixes in over 70% of the cases. In the analysis of real commits, CHATGPT-5.2 detected all injected faults except for two cases and identified a potential real compilation bug in a Linux commit with more than 1,000 modified lines. Our findings indicate that current state-of-the-art foundation models provide a practical and low-effort complement to traditional variability-aware analyses.</p></details> |  |

However, a fundamental cognitive inconsistency exists between general visual representation and remote sensing image interpretation: remote sensing images couple topography, terrain, and spatial structure, thereby inherently requiring models to possess deep geoscientific understanding. This cognitive difference is further amplified in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery: while SAR possesses irreplaceable all-weather, all-day observation capabilities, it is constrained by coherent imaging mechanisms, exhibiting significant modal heterogeneity with general images. To address this inconsistency, we propose FUSAR-KLIP, the first knowledge-guided general multimodal foundational model for SAR, along with reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) FUSAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR dataset with complete geographic projection attributes) was constructed, covering multiple satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities; (2) Aligned structured text was generated through hierarchical cognitive thought chains, accurately encoding more than 1 million multidimensional semantic information from geomorphological environment and regional attributes to spatial relationships; (3) A self-consistent iterative optimization mechanism was designed to guide cross-modal learning with this knowledge information consistent with human cognition and physical laws in a self-supervised closed loop consisting of contrast, matching, and reconstruction; (4) A unified evaluation benchmark was established in 11 typical downstream tasks in the two major categories of vision and language, and compared with 15 mainstream foundation models.</p></details> |  |

This work offers a rigorous, unified benchmark by using four publicly available datasets covering text and image modalities (binary and multiclass complexity) that contrasts traditional Machine Learning (ML) with contemporary transformer-based techniques. We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided. However, the zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) had mixed results; they performed poorly on text-based tasks, but demonstrated competitive performance on the multiclass image task, matching the classical ResNet-50 baseline. These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option. The experiment suggests that foundation models are not universally superior and that the effectiveness of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is highly dependent on the adaptation strategy, as minimal fine-tuning proved detrimental in this study.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, paper accepted in AAIML'26 conference</p></details> |

Although their training corpora are vast, they exclude astronomical time series data. Observations of stars produce peta-scale time series with unique challenges including irregular sampling and heteroskedasticity. We introduce StarEmbed, the first public benchmark for rigorous and standardized evaluation of state-of-the-art TSFMs on stellar time series observations (``light curves''). We benchmark on three scientifically-motivated downstream tasks: unsupervised clustering, supervised classification, and out-of-distribution source detection. StarEmbed integrates a catalog of expert-vetted labels with multi-variate light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, yielding ~40k hand-labeled light curves spread across seven astrophysical classes. We evaluate the zero-shot representation capabilities of three TSFMs (MOIRAI, Chronos, Chronos-Bolt) and a domain-specific transformer (Astromer) against handcrafted feature extraction, the long-standing baseline in the astrophysics literature. Our results demonstrate that these TSFMs, especially the Chronos models, which are trained on data completely unlike the astronomical observations, can outperform established astrophysics-specific baselines in some tasks and effectively generalize to entirely new data. In particular, TSFMs deliver state-of-the-art performance on our out-of-distribution source detection benchmark. With the first benchmark of TSFMs on astronomical time series data, we test the limits of their generalization and motivate a paradigm shift in time-domain astronomy from using task-specific, fully supervised pipelines toward adopting generic foundation model representations for the analysis of peta-scale datasets from forthcoming observatories.</p></details> |  |
| **[VISTA-PATH: An interactive foundation model for pathology image segmentation and quantitative analysis in computational pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16451v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate semantic segmentation for histopathology image is crucial for quantitative tissue analysis and downstream clinical modeling. Recent segmentation foundation models have improved generalization through large-scale pretraining, yet remain poorly aligned with pathology because they treat segmentation as a static visual prediction task. Here we present VISTA-PATH, an interactive, class-aware pathology segmentation foundation model designed to resolve heterogeneous structures, incorporate expert feedback, and produce pixel-level segmentation that are directly meaningful for clinical interpretation. VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert-provided spatial prompts, enabling precise multi-class segmentation across heterogeneous pathology images. To support this paradigm, we curate VISTA-PATH Data, a large-scale pathology segmentation corpus comprising over 1.6 million image-mask-text triplets spanning 9 organs and 93 tissue classes. Across extensive held-out and external benchmarks, VISTA-PATH consistently outperforms existing segmentation foundation models. Importantly, VISTA-PATH supports dynamic human-in-the-loop refinement by propagating sparse, patch-level bounding-box annotation feedback into whole-slide segmentation. Finally, we show that the high-fidelity, class-aware segmentation produced by VISTA-PATH is a preferred model for computational pathology. It improve tissue microenvironment analysis through proposed Tumor Interaction Score (TIS), which exhibits strong and significant associations with patient survival. Together, these results establish VISTA-PATH as a foundation model that elevates pathology image segmentation from a static prediction to an interactive and clinically grounded representation for digital pathology.

In this work, we aim to address this gap by systematically studying the effect of various controlled perturbations of dense visual prompts, that closely mimic real-world imprecision. By conducting experiments with two recent foundational models on a multi-organ abdominal segmentation task, we reveal several facets of promptable medical segmentation, especially pertaining to reliance on visual shape and spatial cues, and the extent of resilience of models towards certain perturbations.

On the Ability of Foundation Models to Recognize Contextually Important Moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16333v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are used for many real-world applications involving language generation from temporally-ordered multimodal events. In this work, we study the ability of models to identify the most important sub-events in a video, which is a fundamental prerequisite for narrating or summarizing multimodal events. Specifically, we focus on football games and evaluate models on their ability to distinguish between important and non-important sub-events in a game. To this end, we construct a new dataset by leveraging human preferences for importance implicit in football game highlight reels, without any additional annotation costs. Using our dataset, which we will publicly release to the community, we compare several state-of-the-art multimodal models and show that they are not far from chance level performance. Analyses of models beyond standard evaluation metrics reveal their tendency to rely on a single dominant modality and their ineffectiveness in synthesizing necessary information from multiple sources. Our findings underline the importance of modular architectures that can handle sample-level heterogeneity in multimodal data and the need for complementary training procedures that can maximize cross-modal synergy.</p></details> |  |

To help address these challenges, we developed Mantis, a foundation model trained entirely on mechanistic simulations, which enables out-of-the-box forecasting across diseases, regions, and outcomes, even in settings with limited historical data. We evaluated Mantis against 48 forecasting models across six diseases with diverse modes of transmission, assessing both point forecast accuracy (mean absolute error) and probabilistic performance (weighted interval score and coverage). Despite using no real-world data during training, Mantis achieved lower mean absolute error than all models in the CDC's COVID-19 Forecast Hub when backtested on early pandemic forecasts which it had not previously seen. Across all other diseases tested, Mantis consistently ranked in the top two models across evaluation metrics. Mantis further generalized to diseases with transmission mechanisms not represented in its training data, demonstrating that it can capture fundamental contagion dynamics rather than memorizing disease-specific patterns. These capabilities illustrate that purely simulation-based foundation models such as Mantis can provide a practical foundation for disease forecasting: general-purpose, accurate, and deployable where traditional models struggle.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

However, their deployment in federated settings is hindered by high computational demands, substantial communication overhead, and significant inference costs. We propose DSFedMed, a dual-scale federated framework that enables mutual knowledge distillation between a centralized foundation model and lightweight client models for medical image segmentation. To support knowledge distillation, a set of high-quality medical images is generated to replace real public datasets, and a learnability-guided sample selection strategy is proposed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in dual-scale distillation. This mutual distillation enables the foundation model to transfer general knowledge to lightweight clients, while also incorporating client-specific insights to refine the foundation model. Evaluations on five medical imaging segmentation datasets show that DSFedMed achieves an average 2 percent improvement in Dice score while reducing communication costs and inference time by nearly 90 percent compared to existing federated foundation model baselines. These results demonstrate significant efficiency gains and scalability for resource-limited federated deployments.</p></details> |  |

This limits their deployment in real-world scenarios requiring flexible computeaccuracy trade-offs. We propose THOR, a "computeadaptive" foundation model that solves both input heterogeneity and deployment rigidity. THOR is the first architecture to unify data from Copernicus Sentinel-1, -2, and -3 (OLCI & SLSTR) satellites, processing their native 10 m to 1000 m resolutions in a single model. We pre-train THOR with a novel randomized patch and input image size strategy. This allows a single set of pre-trained weights to be deployed at inference with any patch size, enabling a dynamic trade-off between computational cost and feature resolution without retraining. We pre-train THOR on THOR Pretrain, a new, large-scale multi-sensor dataset and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on downstream benchmarks, particularly in data-limited regimes like the PANGAEA 10% split, validating that THOR's flexible feature generation excels for diverse climate and society applications.</p></details> | 25 pages |

Existing benchmarks attempting to measure this matter rely on synthetic, Visual Question Answer templates or focus on perceptual video quality that is tangential to measuring how well the video abides by physical laws. To address this fragmentation, we introduce PhysicsMind, a unified benchmark with both real and simulation environments that evaluates law-consistent reasoning and generation over three canonical principles: Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law. PhysicsMind comprises two main tasks: i) VQA tasks, testing whether models can reason and determine physical quantities and values from images or short videos, and ii) Video Generation(VG) tasks, evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey the same center-of-mass, torque, and inertial constraints as the ground truth. A broad range of recent models and video generation models is evaluated on PhysicsMind and found to rely on appearance heuristics while often violating basic mechanics. These gaps indicate that current scaling and training are still insufficient for robust physical understanding, underscoring PhysicsMind as a focused testbed for physics-aware multimodal models. Our data will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Opening the Black Box: Preliminary Insights into Affective Modeling in Multimodal Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15906v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding where and how emotions are represented in large-scale foundation models remains an open problem, particularly in multimodal affective settings. Despite the strong empirical performance of recent affective models, the internal architectural mechanisms that support affective understanding and generation are still poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic mechanistic study of affective modeling in multimodal foundation models. Across multiple architectures, training strategies, and affective tasks, we analyze how emotion-oriented supervision reshapes internal model parameters. Our results consistently reveal a clear and robust pattern: affective adaptation does not primarily focus on the attention module, but instead localizes to the feed-forward gating projection (\texttt{gate\_proj}). Through controlled module transfer, targeted single-module adaptation, and destructive ablation, we further demonstrate that \texttt{gate\_proj} is sufficient, efficient, and necessary for affective understanding and generation. Notably, by tuning only approximately 24.5\% of the parameters tuned by AffectGPT, our approach achieves 96.6\% of its average performance across eight affective tasks, highlighting substantial parameter efficiency. Together, these findings provide empirical evidence that affective capabilities in foundation models are structurally mediated by feed-forward gating mechanisms and identify \texttt{gate\_proj} as a central architectural locus of affective modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Transfer Limits of Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15888v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models leverage large-scale pretraining to capture extensive knowledge, demonstrating generalization in a wide range of language tasks. By comparison, vision foundation models (VFMs) often exhibit uneven improvements across downstream tasks, despite substantial computational investment. We postulate that this limitation arises from a mismatch between pretraining objectives and the demands of downstream vision-and-imaging tasks. Pretraining strategies like masked image reconstruction or contrastive learning shape representations for tasks such as recovery of generic visual patterns or global semantic structures, which may not align with the task-specific requirements of downstream applications including segmentation, classification, or image synthesis. To investigate this in a concrete real-world clinical area, we assess two VFMs, a reconstruction-focused MAE-based model (ProFound) and a contrastive-learning-based model (ProViCNet), on five prostate multiparametric MR imaging tasks, examining how such task alignment influences transfer performance, i.e., from pretraining to fine-tuning. Our findings indicate that better alignment between pretraining and downstream tasks, measured by simple divergence metrics such as maximum-mean-discrepancy (MMD) between the same features before and after fine-tuning, correlates with greater performance improvements and faster convergence, emphasizing the importance of designing and analyzing pretraining objectives with downstream applicability in mind.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in ISBI 2026</p></details> |

Recent large language models have opened new avenues for genomic analysis, but existing approaches are often limited by restricted training scope, constrained generative capability, or prohibitive computational cost. We introduce GENErator, a generative genomic foundation model for long-context DNA modeling, with a context length of 98k nucleotides, pre-trained on 386 billion nucleotides of eukaryotic DNA. Without task-specific fine-tuning, GENERator exhibits strong intrinsic capabilities: unsupervised embedding analyses reveal phylogenetically coherent structure, and sequence recovery benchmarks demonstrate generative accuracy comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art models with substantially improved computational efficiency. In a zero-shot setting, GENERator achieves competitive variant effect prediction performance relative to alignment-based methods, while remaining fully alignment-free and broadly applicable across species. With task-specific fine-tuning, the model attains leading performance on established genomic benchmarks. We further demonstrate practical generative applications. GENERator can generate protein-coding DNA sequences that translate into structurally plausible proteins and, through a prompt-guided design framework, design cis-regulatory elements with targeted activity profiles, including synthetic super-enhancers validated by high-throughput UMI-STARR-seq assays. Together, these results establish GENERator as an efficient and biologically grounded framework for genomic interpretation and programmable sequence design.

We introduce SAGE-FM, a lightweight spatial transcriptomics foundation model based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) trained with a masked central spot prediction objective. Trained on 416 human Visium samples spanning 15 organs, SAGE-FM learns spatially coherent embeddings that robustly recover masked genes, with 91% of masked genes showing significant correlations (p < 0.05). The embeddings generated by SAGE-FM outperform MOFA and existing spatial transcriptomics methods in unsupervised clustering and preservation of biological heterogeneity. SAGE-FM generalizes to downstream tasks, enabling 81% accuracy in pathologist-defined spot annotation in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and improving glioblastoma subtype prediction relative to MOFA. In silico perturbation experiments further demonstrate that the model captures directional ligand-receptor and upstream-downstream regulatory effects consistent with ground truth. These results demonstrate that simple, parameter-efficient GCNs can serve as biologically interpretable and spatially aware foundation models for large-scale spatial transcriptomics.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |

This paper discusses the components of PyTDC's architecture and, to our knowledge, the first-of-its-kind case study on the introduced single-cell drug-target nomination ML task. We find state-of-the-art methods in graph representation learning and domain-specific methods from graph theory perform poorly on this task. Though we find a context-aware geometric deep learning method that outperforms the evaluated SoTA and domain-specific baseline methods, the model is unable to generalize to unseen cell types or incorporate additional modalities, highlighting PyTDC's capacity to facilitate an exciting avenue of research developing multimodal, context-aware, foundation models for open problems in biomedical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada.

Classical work by Holmström established that under pure self-interest, Nash equilibrium is universal shirking. While i* represents teams as composite actors, it lacks scalable computational mechanisms for analyzing how collective action problems emerge and resolve in coopetitive settings. This technical report extends computational foundations for strategic coopetition to team-level dynamics, building on companion work formalizing interdependence/complementarity (arXiv:2510.18802) and trust dynamics (arXiv:2510.24909). We develop loyalty-moderated utility functions with two mechanisms: loyalty benefit (welfare internalization plus intrinsic contribution satisfaction) and cost tolerance (reduced effort burden for loyal members). We integrate i* structural dependencies through dependency-weighted team cohesion, connecting member incentives to team-level positioning. The framework applies to both human teams (loyalty as psychological identification) and multi-agent systems (alignment coefficients and adjusted cost functions). Experimental validation across 3,125 configurations demonstrates robust loyalty effects (15.04x median effort differentiation). All six behavioral targets achieve thresholds: free-riding baseline (96.5%), loyalty monotonicity (100%), effort differentiation (100%), team size effect (100%), mechanism synergy (99.5%), and bounded outcomes (100%). Empirical validation using published Apache HTTP Server (1995-2023) case study achieves 60/60 points, reproducing contribution patterns across formation, growth, maturation, and governance phases.

Unlike traditional models, which are limited to fixed-length input sizes or configurations, OmniSpectra handles spectra of any length at their original size, without resampling or interpolation. Despite the large-scale spectroscopic data from diverse surveys fueling the rapid growth of astronomy, existing foundation models are limited to a fixed wavelength range and specific instruments. OmniSpectra is the first foundation model to learn simultaneously from multiple real-world spectra surveys with different configurations at a large scale. We achieve this by designing a novel architecture with adaptive patching across variable lengths, sinusoidal global wavelength encoding, local positional embeddings through depthwise convolution, and validity-aware self-attention masks. Allowing us to learn multi-scale spatial patterns while skipping attention for invalid patches. Even with a limited training example, OmniSpectra demonstrates excellent zero-shot generalization compared to methods tailored for specific tasks. This transfer learning capability makes this model the state-of-the-art across various astronomy tasks, including source classification, redshift estimation, and properties prediction for stars and galaxies. OmniSpectra reduces the need for training individual models for different tasks from scratch, establishing itself as the next-generation astronomy foundation model.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Contrastive Pre-trained Foundation Model for Deciphering Imaging Noisomics across Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17047v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Characterizing imaging noise is notoriously data-intensive and device-dependent, as modern sensors entangle physical signals with complex algorithmic artifacts. Current paradigms struggle to disentangle these factors without massive supervised datasets, often reducing noise to mere interference rather than an information resource. Here, we introduce "Noisomics", a framework shifting the focus from suppression to systematic noise decoding via the Contrastive Pre-trained (CoP) Foundation Model. By leveraging the manifold hypothesis and synthetic noise genome, CoP employs contrastive learning to disentangle semantic signals from stochastic perturbations. Crucially, CoP breaks traditional deep learning scaling laws, achieving superior performance with only 100 training samples, outperforming supervised baselines trained on 100,000 samples, thereby reducing data and computational dependency by three orders of magnitude. Extensive benchmarking across 12 diverse out-of-domain datasets confirms its robust zero-shot generalization, demonstrating a 63.8% reduction in estimation error and an 85.1% improvement in the coefficient of determination compared to the conventional training strategy. We demonstrate CoP's utility across scales: from deciphering non-linear hardware-noise interplay in consumer photography to optimizing photon-efficient protocols for deep-tissue microscopy. By decoding noise as a multi-parametric footprint, our work redefines stochastic degradation as a vital information resource, empowering precise imaging diagnostics without prior device calibration.</p></details> |  |

Test-time adaptation (TTA) has recently emerged as a viable strategy to address such domain shifts at inference time without requiring access to source data or labels. However, existing TTA approaches, particularly those relying on backpropagation, are memory-intensive, limiting their applicability in speech tasks and resource-constrained settings. Although backpropagation-free methods offer improved efficiency, existing ones exhibit poor accuracy. This is because they are predominantly developed for vision tasks, which fundamentally differ from speech task formulations, noise characteristics, and model architecture, posing unique transferability challenges. In this paper, we introduce E-BATS, the first Efficient BAckpropagation-free TTA framework designed explicitly for speech foundation models. E-BATS achieves a balance between adaptation effectiveness and memory efficiency through three key components: (i) lightweight prompt adaptation for a forward-pass-based feature alignment, (ii) a multi-scale loss to capture both global (utterance-level) and local distribution shifts (token-level) and (iii) a test-time exponential moving average mechanism for stable adaptation across utterances. Experiments conducted on four noisy speech datasets spanning sixteen acoustic conditions demonstrate consistent improvements, with 4.1%-13.5% accuracy gains over backpropagation-free baselines and 2.0-6.4 times GPU memory savings compared to backpropagation-based methods. By enabling scalable and robust adaptation under acoustic variability, this work paves the way for developing more efficient adaptation approaches for practical speech processing systems in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing SFOD methods predominantly rely on internal knowledge from the source model, which limits their capacity to generalize across domains and often results in biased pseudo-labels, thereby hindering both transferability and discriminability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pretrained on massive and diverse data, exhibit strong perception capabilities and broad generalization, yet their potential remains largely untapped in the SFOD setting. In this paper, we propose a novel SFOD framework that leverages VFMs as external knowledge sources to jointly enhance feature alignment and label quality. Specifically, we design three VFM-based modules: (1) Patch-weighted Global Feature Alignment (PGFA) distills global features from VFMs using patch-similarity-based weighting to enhance global feature transferability; (2) Prototype-based Instance Feature Alignment (PIFA) performs instance-level contrastive learning guided by momentum-updated VFM prototypes; and (3) Dual-source Enhanced Pseudo-label Fusion (DEPF) fuses predictions from detection VFMs and teacher models via an entropy-aware strategy to yield more reliable supervision. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art SFOD performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VFMs to simultaneously improve transferability and discriminability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

We propose CausalMixFT, a method that enhances fine-tuning robustness and downstream performance by generating structurally consistent synthetic samples using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) fitted on the target dataset. This approach augments limited real data with causally informed synthetic examples, preserving feature dependencies while expanding training diversity. Evaluated across 33 classification datasets from TabArena and over 2300 fine-tuning runs, our CausalMixFT method consistently improves median normalized ROC-AUC from 0.10 (standard fine-tuning) to 0.12, outperforming purely statistical generators such as CTGAN (-0.01), TabEBM (-0.04), and TableAugment (-0.09). Moreover, it narrows the median validation-test performance correlation gap from 0.67 to 0.30, enabling more reliable validation-based early stopping, a key step toward improving fine-tuning stability under data scarcity. These results demonstrate that incorporating causal structure into data augmentation provides an effective and principled route to fine-tuning tabular foundation models in low-data regimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at the EurIPS 2025 Workshop on AI for Tabular Data (Copenhagen).

| **[On Foundation Models for Temporal Point Processes to Accelerate Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12640v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally, machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly, without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fast Coarse-graining and Equation Discovery with Foundation Inference Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12618v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g., the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple, simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.</p></details> |  |

While empirical studies have proposed various approaches that primarily focus on enforcing cross-view constraints at photometric level, few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view setting. In this work, we propose GeoSurDepth, a framework that leverages geometry consistency as the primary cue for surround-view depth estimation. Concretely, we utilize vision foundation models as pseudo geometry priors and feature representation enhancement tool to guide the network to maintain surface normal consistency in spatial 3D space and regularize object- and texture-consistent depth estimation in 2D. In addition, we introduce a novel view synthesis pipeline where 2D-3D lifting is achieved with dense depth reconstructed via spatial warping, encouraging additional photometric supervision across temporal and spatial contexts, and compensating for the limitations of target-view image reconstruction. Finally, a newly-proposed adaptive joint motion learning strategy enables the network to adaptively emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning. Extensive experiments on KITTI, DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate that GeoSurDepth achieves SoTA performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our framework highlights the importance of exploiting geometry coherence and consistency for robust self-supervised depth estimation.</p></details> |  |

In Earth Observation (EO), the availability of petabyte-scale satellite archives has recently enabled the development of GeoSpatial Foundation Models (GFMs). Yet, fundamental questions remain regarding how dataset size, model architecture, and size interact to determine downstream performance. In this work, we systematically explore this design space by pretraining and fine-tuning models on three dataset scales: PhilEO Globe (0.5TB), FastTOM (2TB, introduced here), and MajorTOM (23TB). We evaluate three architectural families: Geo-Aware U-Net (CNN), ViT-UPerNet (Transformer), and Mamba (State-Space Model); across model sizes ranging from 44M to 300M parameters. All models are benchmarked on the PhilEO Bench, covering: road density and building density regression, and land cover segmentation, and are compared against existing GFMs such as TerraMind and Prithvi-EO-2.0. Our results show that CNN-based models remain highly competitive in low-shot settings, with a 200M-parameter Geo-Aware U-Net outperforming larger architectures on regression tasks. However, when scaling to multi-terabyte datasets, ViT-UPerNet achieves the best performance, particularly for semantic segmentation on MajorTOM (23TB). Finally, we provide the first extensive evaluation of Mamba models in EO, highlighting their potential efficiency advantages, though further large-scale pretraining is required to fully match CNNs and ViTs. All code, pretrained models, and the FastTOM dataset are released publicly, enabling reproducibility and further exploration of scaling laws for GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables, Submitted</p></details> |

However, existing research has primarily focused on point-and-click (PnC) interaction, while remote-control (RC) interaction commonly encountered in everyday TV usage remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce \textbf{TVWorld}, an offline graph-based abstraction of real-world TV navigation that enables reproducible and deployment-free evaluation. On this basis, we derive two complementary benchmarks that comprehensively assess TV-use capabilities: \textbf{TVWorld-N} for topology-aware navigation and \textbf{TVWorld-G} for focus-aware grounding. These benchmarks expose a key limitation of existing agents: insufficient topology awareness for focus-based, long-horizon TV navigation. Motivated by this finding, we propose a \emph{Topology-Aware Training} framework that injects topology awareness into LVLMs. Using this framework, we develop \textbf{TVTheseus}, a foundation model specialized for TV navigation. TVTheseus achieves a success rate of $68.3\%$ on TVWorld-N, surpassing strong closed-source baselines such as Gemini 3 Flash and establishing state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Additional analyses further provide valuable insights into the development of effective TV-use agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image-to-Video Transfer Learning based on Image-Language Foundation Models: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10671v3)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in vision-language understanding, providing transferable multimodal representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks. The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, termed as image-to-video transfer learning, effectively mitigates the substantial data and computational demands compared to training video-language models from scratch while achieves comparable or even stronger model performance. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by summarizing the widely used ILFMs and their capabilities. We then systematically classify existing image-to-video transfer learning techniques into two broad root categories (frozen features and adapted features), along with numerous fine-grained subcategories, based on the paradigm for transferring image understanding capability to video tasks. Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained settings (e.g., spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained ones (e.g., video question answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM, and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

We introduce SDF-HOLO (Systemic Dual-stream Fusion Holo Model), a multimodal foundation model for holistic total-body PET/CT, pre-trained on more than 10,000 patients. SDF-HOLO decouples CT and PET representation learning with dual-stream encoders and couples them through a cross-modal interaction module, allowing anatomical context to refine PET aggregation while metabolic saliency guides subtle morphological reasoning. To model long-range dependencies across the body, hierarchical context modeling combines efficient local windows with global attention. To bridge voxels and clinical language, we use anatomical segmentation masks as explicit semantic anchors and perform voxel-mask-text alignment during pre-training. Across tumor segmentation, low-dose lesion detection, and multilingual diagnostic report generation, SDF-HOLO outperforms strong task-specific and clinical-reference baselines while reducing localization errors and hallucinated findings. Beyond focal interpretation, the model enables system-wide metabolic profiling and reveals tumor-associated fingerprints of inter-organ metabolic network interactions, providing a scalable computational foundation for total-body PET/CT diagnostics and system-level precision oncology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling Time Series Foundation Models for Efficient Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12785v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series foundation models (TSFMs) deliver strong forecasting performance through large-scale pretraining, but their large parameter sizes make deployment costly. While knowledge distillation offers a natural and effective approach for model compression, techniques developed for general machine learning tasks are not directly applicable to time series forecasting due to the unique characteristics. To address this, we present DistilTS, the first distillation framework specifically designed for TSFMs. DistilTS addresses two key challenges: (1) task difficulty discrepancy, specific to forecasting, where uniform weighting makes optimization dominated by easier short-term horizons, while long-term horizons receive weaker supervision; and (2) architecture discrepancy, a general challenge in distillation, for which we design an alignment mechanism in the time series forecasting. To overcome these issues, DistilTS introduces horizon-weighted objectives to balance learning across horizons, and a temporal alignment strategy that reduces architectural mismatch, enabling compact models. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DistilTS achieves forecasting performance comparable to full-sized TSFMs, while reducing parameters by up to 1/150 and accelerating inference by up to 6000x. Code is available at: https://github.com/itsnotacie/DistilTS-ICASSP2026.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP-2026</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Blockchain Survey: Foundations, Trends, and Gaps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13720v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing poses fundamental risks to classical blockchain systems by undermining widely used cryptographic primitives. In response, two major research directions have emerged: post-quantum blockchains, which integrate quantum-resistant algorithms, and quantum blockchains, which leverage quantum properties such as entanglement and quantum key distribution. This survey reviews key developments in both areas, analyzing their cryptographic foundations, architectural designs, and implementation challenges. This work provides a comparative overview of technical proposals, highlight trade-offs in security, scalability, and deployment, and identify open research problems across hardware, consensus, and network design.

| **[The Promise of Time-Series Foundation Models for Agricultural Forecasting: Evidence from Commodity Prices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06371v2)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting agricultural markets remains challenging due to nonlinear dynamics, structural breaks, and sparse data. A long-standing belief holds that simple time-series methods outperform more advanced alternatives. This paper provides the first systematic evidence that this belief no longer holds with modern time-series foundation models (TSFMs). Using USDA ERS monthly commodity price data from 1997-2025, we evaluate 17 forecasting approaches across four model classes, including traditional time-series, machine learning, deep learning, and five state-of-the-art TSFMs (Chronos, Chronos-2, TimesFM 2.5, Time-MoE, Moirai-2), and construct annual marketing year price predictions to compare with USDA's futures-based season-average price (SAP) forecasts. We show that zero-shot foundation models consistently outperform traditional time-series methods, machine learning, and deep learning architectures trained from scratch in both monthly and annual forecasting. Furthermore, foundation models remarkably outperform USDA's futures-based forecasts on three of four major commodities despite USDA's information advantage from forward-looking futures markets. Time-MoE delivers the largest accuracy gains, achieving 54.9% improvement on wheat and 18.5% improvement on corn relative to USDA ERS benchmarks on recent data (2017-2024 excluding COVID). These results point to a paradigm shift in agricultural forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hierarchical Benchmark of Foundation Models for Dermatology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12382v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have transformed medical image analysis by providing robust feature representations that reduce the need for large-scale task-specific training. However, current benchmarks in dermatology often reduce the complex diagnostic taxonomy to flat, binary classification tasks, such as distinguishing melanoma from benign nevi. This oversimplification obscures a model's ability to perform fine-grained differential diagnoses, which is critical for clinical workflow integration. This study evaluates the utility of embeddings derived from ten foundation models, spanning general computer vision, general medical imaging, and dermatology-specific domains, for hierarchical skin lesion classification. Using the DERM12345 dataset, which comprises 40 lesion subclasses, we calculated frozen embeddings and trained lightweight adapter models using a five-fold cross-validation. We introduce a hierarchical evaluation framework that assesses performance across four levels of clinical granularity: 40 Subclasses, 15 Main Classes, 2 and 4 Superclasses, and Binary Malignancy. Our results reveal a "granularity gap" in model capabilities: MedImageInsights achieved the strongest overall performance (97.52% weighted F1-Score on Binary Malignancy detection) but declined to 65.50% on fine-grained 40-class subtype classification. Conversely, MedSigLip (69.79%) and dermatology-specific models (Derm Foundation and MONET) excelled at fine-grained 40-class subtype discrimination while achieving lower overall performance than MedImageInsights on broader classification tasks. Our findings suggest that while general medical foundation models are highly effective for high-level screening, specialized modeling strategies are necessary for the granular distinctions required in diagnostic support systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DepthCropSeg++: Scaling a Crop Segmentation Foundation Model With Depth-Labeled Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12366v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DepthCropSeg++: a foundation model for crop segmentation, capable of segmenting different crop species under open in-field environment. Crop segmentation is a fundamental task for modern agriculture, which closely relates to many downstream tasks such as plant phenotyping, density estimation, and weed control. In the era of foundation models, a number of generic large language and vision models have been developed. These models have demonstrated remarkable real world generalization due to significant model capacity and largescale datasets. However, current crop segmentation models mostly learn from limited data due to expensive pixel-level labelling cost, often performing well only under specific crop types or controlled environment. In this work, we follow the vein of our previous work DepthCropSeg, an almost unsupervised approach to crop segmentation, to scale up a cross-species and crossscene crop segmentation dataset, with 28,406 images across 30+ species and 15 environmental conditions. We also build upon a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation architecture ViT-Adapter architecture, enhance it with dynamic upsampling for improved detail awareness, and train the model with a two-stage selftraining pipeline. To systematically validate model performance, we conduct comprehensive experiments to justify the effectiveness and generalization capabilities across multiple crop datasets. Results demonstrate that DepthCropSeg++ achieves 93.11% mIoU on a comprehensive testing set, outperforming both supervised baselines and general-purpose vision foundation models like Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) by significant margins (+0.36% and +48.57% respectively). The model particularly excels in challenging scenarios including night-time environment (86.90% mIoU), high-density canopies (90.09% mIoU), and unseen crop varieties (90.09% mIoU), indicating a new state of the art for crop segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 15 figures and 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[SLIM-Brain: A Data- and Training-Efficient Foundation Model for fMRI Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21881v2)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are emerging as a powerful paradigm for fMRI analysis, but current approaches face a dual bottleneck of data- and training-efficiency. Atlas-based methods aggregate voxel signals into fixed regions of interest, reducing data dimensionality but discarding fine-grained spatial details, and requiring extremely large cohorts to train effectively as general-purpose foundation models. Atlas-free methods, on the other hand, operate directly on voxel-level information - preserving spatial fidelity but are prohibitively memory- and compute-intensive, making large-scale pre-training infeasible. We introduce SLIM-Brain (Sample-efficient, Low-memory fMRI Foundation Model for Human Brain), a new atlas-free foundation model that simultaneously improves both data- and training-efficiency. SLIM-Brain adopts a two-stage adaptive design: (i) a lightweight temporal extractor captures global context across full sequences and ranks data windows by saliency, and (ii) a 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from the top-$k$ selected windows, while deleting about 70% masked patches. Extensive experiments across seven public benchmarks show that SLIM-Brain establishes new state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks, while requiring only 4 thousand pre-training sessions and approximately 30% of GPU memory comparing to traditional voxel-level methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wavelet-Driven Masked Multiscale Reconstruction for PPG Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12215v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wearable foundation models have the potential to transform digital health by learning transferable representations from large-scale biosignals collected in everyday settings. While recent progress has been made in large-scale pretraining, most approaches overlook the spectral structure of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, wherein physiological rhythms unfold across multiple frequency bands. Motivated by the insight that many downstream health-related tasks depend on multi-resolution features spanning fine-grained waveform morphology to global rhythmic dynamics, we introduce Masked Multiscale Reconstruction (MMR) for PPG representation learning - a self-supervised pretraining framework that explicitly learns from hierarchical time-frequency scales of PPG data. The pretraining task is designed to reconstruct randomly masked out coefficients obtained from a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition of PPG signals, forcing the transformer encoder to integrate information across temporal and spectral scales. We pretrain our model with MMR using ~17 million unlabeled 10-second PPG segments from ~32,000 smartwatch users. On 17 of 19 diverse health-related tasks, MMR trained on large-scale wearable PPG data improves over or matches state-of-the-art open-source PPG foundation models, time-series foundation models, and other self-supervised baselines. Extensive analysis of our learned embeddings and systematic ablations underscores the value of wavelet-based representations, showing that they capture robust and physiologically-grounded features. Together, these results highlight the potential of MMR as a step toward generalizable PPG foundation models.</p></details> |  |
